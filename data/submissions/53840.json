The accidental release prevention program includes:\n?       Process Safety Information, which includes an MSDS sheets for chlorine, safety information for the chlorine system and process chemistry for chlorine and sodium hydroxide; inventory which is an ongoing update of chlorine quantities on hand; Flow Diagrams, these are detailed drawings of the piping, instrumentation and process flow, repackaging flow, piping and instrumentation symbols; Piping Isometric Diagrams and Material Specification sheets, these include detailed drawings of the sodium hypochlorite manufacturing facility, chlorine repackaging facility, tank car unloading and distribution piping, chlorine venting system and the bi-gas system; Design Code and Standards including various publications of The Chlorine Institute manuals and other indexes and handbooks; Electrical One Line Diagrams which are detailed drawings of all the electrical wiring throughout the facility; Firewater Piping System this states that our facility has no dedicated fire water piping system.  Local officials have approved the size and type of our fire extinguishers as being adequate; Sewer System Diagrams, stating these diagrams are not included.\n?       Hazard Analysis/Risk Assessment, this includes process hazard analysis for the chlorine system.  It presents different release scenarios and the area effected by them; \n?       Standard Operating Procedures which include detailed instructions on chlorine repackaging, hypochlorite manufacturing and inspection procedures of chlorine tank trucks; \n?
