These principles have \nresulted in clear UPI business strategies that call for continual improvement \nof safety, quality, customer satisfaction, protection and preservation of the \nenvironment, and community responsibility.  Implementation of, and \nadherence to, these business strategies requires the full commitment of all \nUPI employees.\n\nUPI policy dictates that each division continuously identify methods to \nreduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community \nand environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and \nprocedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations \nis documented in the facility policy statements and the manual \"Principles of \nAccident Prevention\", which are available to all employees. UPI stresses safe \nand environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in \nwritten materials  (such as safety and health bulletins) periodically provided \nto all employees.  UPI safety and environmental programs include monthly \nsafety meetings for all employees and a joint worker/company safety \ncommittee. UPI supervisory and management personnel conduct both \nregularly scheduled and unscheduled (surprise) audits of internal safety, \nhousekeeping and environmental compliance and practices.\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE USS-POSCO PLANT AND THE REGULATED \nSUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nUSS-POSCO Industries (UPI) is located at 900 Loveridge Road in the city of \nPittsburg, approximately 1/2 mile north of Highway 4.  The UPI property \noccupies approximately 490 acres.  It is bordered by the New York Slough of \nthe San Joaquin/Sacramento River on t"

The nearest residences are \nlocated approximately 3/4 miles to the southwest of  any facilities handling \nchemicals regulated under the RMP Rule.\n\nThe plant employs approximately 1000 people.  The major divisions within \nthe UPI facility include: the Rolling Division, the Tin Products Division, the \nSheet Products Division, and the Technology Services Division.\n\nThe Rolling Division is responsible for the initial steel processing operations \nof the facility.  It typically operates continuously, 24 hours per day, seven \ndays per week, with management supervision continuously present.\n\nThe Tin Products Division is responsible for the subsequent steel processes \nthat result in the production of tinplate products.  The processing facilities \ninclude two Electrolytic Tinning Lines (ETLs), where sulfuric acid is utilized \nfor pickling and chrome recovery, and a continuous annealing line.  As in the \nRolling Division, operation and supervisory coverage are continuous.\n\nThe Sheet Products Division is responsible for subsequent processes that \nresult in the production of sheet products, cold rolled sheets, and galvanized \nsheets.  The facilities include a Kawasaki Multipurpose Continuous \nAnnealing Line (KMCAL), where ammonia is utilized for reducing NOx \n(nitrogen oxide compounds) emissions from the furnace exhaust stack.\n\nThe annealing furnaces operated by the Tin Products and Sheet Products \nDivisions require internal atmospheres consisting of hydrogen diluted in \nnitrogen (concentrations ranging from 5 to 30 volume percent hydrogen).  \nThese reducing atmospheres are required to exclude moisture and air from \nthe furnaces to prevent oxidation of the steel at the high furnace temperatures.\n\nThe Technology Services Division provides engineering services and \nmaintenance support for the facility.

The sulfuric acid solutions used at UPI \nare at concentration of 93 weight percent or less and, thus, fall below the \nconcentration threshold established under the RMP Rule.\n\nDescription of the Ammonia Process\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at UPI for reducing NOx (nitrogen oxide \ncompounds) emissions from the KMCAL furnace exhaust stack.  NOx \ncompounds in the atmosphere are one of the significant precursors to \nphotochemical smog.  The ammonia, in the presence of a catalyst, \ndecomposes NOx compounds into nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O).  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form in an outdoor 12,000-gallon \nsupply vessel.  The vessel sits on a concrete pad that is surrounded by a \nlocked fence. \n\nThe amount of ammonia stored in the supply vessel is limited to 85% of the \nvessel capacity, which is 10,200 gallons (52,500 pounds at 60oF).  \nInstrumentation on the vessel includes a low and low-low level switch, a \nlevel indicator, a pressure gage, and a temperature indicator.  The ammonia \nsupply vessel has a design pressure of 265 psig and is protected by two 1-1/4-\ninch relief valve manifolds, each with two separate relief valves that vent to \nthe atmosphere (one relief valve on each manifold is valved into service at \nany time).\n\nAmmonia is withdrawn from the vapor space of the supply vessel via a 3/4-\ninch line.  The line feeds into a pressure-reducing valve, also on the concrete \npad.  The pressure is reduced to approximately 30 psig, at which point the \nline expands to 1-inch diameter.  The 1-inch line runs supported and above \nground into the Sheet and Tin Mill Building.  Inside the Sheet and Tin Mill \nBuilding, it runs through an underground trench and an overhead pipeway to \na fenced-in flow control station.\n\nThe flow control station consists of a pressure regulato"

The flow control station \nregulates the ammonia vapor flow to the furnace stack as a function of the \nflue gas flow rate.  The solenoid valve shuts off the ammonia supply in the \nevent of a furnace upset, such as low temperature in the furnace stack.  This \nprecaution is necessary since ammonia entering the flue gas at a temperature \nof less than 392oF can form the explosive compound ammonium nitrate \n(NH4NO3).\n\nThe 1/2-inch diameter ammonia vapor supply line exits the flow control \nstation and travels up a structural steel column to the flue gas injection point.  \nAn air blower mixes air with the ammonia stream, and the mix enters the \nfurnace stack through a manifold. \n\nThe pressure in the ammonia supply vessel varies with the ambient \ntemperature.   A vaporizer is provided to ensure that sufficient ammonia \nvapor is available during cold ambient conditions.  The vaporizer heats the \nliquid as necessary to maintain a vessel pressure above 80 psig (vapor \npressure of ammonia at approximately 53oF).  The vaporizer switches off \nwhen the vessel pressure exceeds 100 psig (approximately 64oF).  A high-\nhigh pressure switch will also shut down the vaporizer at 200 psig \n(approximately 101oF).  An independent high temperature switch set at \n100oF (corresponding to a vapor pressure of approximately 197 psig) will \nalso shut down the vaporizer.\n\nAmmonia is received in tank trucks and is transferred into the storage tank \nthrough a two inch liquid fill line.  Vapors displaced from the storage tank \nreturn to the tank truck via a 1-inch pressure equalizing line.  The pressure \nequalizing line, which connects the vapor space of the supply vessel to the \nvapor space of the tanker truck, is opened to equalize any pressure \ndifferences between the systems prior to loading.

When ammonia is released to the atmosphere, it creates a dense, \nwhite fog because it reacts with water in the atmosphere.\n\nAt normal temperatures and pressures, anhydrous ammonia is a gas.  It is \neasily liquefied by pressurizing in a container and is commonly transported \nand stored as a liquid.  At atmospheric pressure, the liquid density of \nammonia is approximately 2/3 that of water, and ammonia gas is lighter than \nair.\n\nPhysiological Effects\n\nAmmonia in the ambient air has an intense, acute effect upon the mucous \nmembranes of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs.  Exposure to a high \nconcentration of ammonia can produce corrosive action on these tissues, \nwhich can lead to impairment of the respiratory system and, possibly, death.  \nAmmonia is a regulated substance under the RMP Rule due to this acute \ntoxicity. A more detailed description of the health effects of ammonia is \npresented in the offsite consequence analysis section of this document.\n\nDescription of the Hydrogen Process\n\nLiquid hydrogen is stored in two double-walled stainless steel pressure \nvessels (one 9000-gallon, one 18,000 gallon).  Administrative controls limit \nthe contents of the larger tank to no more than 9500 lbs of liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe hydrogen is delivered, and unloaded by the supplier, who also has \nresponsibility for the operation, inspection and maintenance of the hydrogen \nstorage system. The hydrogen is stored at a pressure of approximately 40 \npsig; an economizer that circulates vaporized hydrogen to the tank headspace \nmaintains hydrogen storage pressure.  The storage vessels are pressure \nprotected by primary relief valves, installed spare relief valves, and rupture \ndiscs.  The relief valves are set to open at 150 psig.

The \nremaining pure vaporized hydrogen is piped to nitrogen mixing stations in the \nWest Gas Room and in the KMCAL Gas Room. There are three parallel \nmixing systems in the West Gas Room and a single system in the KMCAL \nGas Room.  Each mixing system includes a mixer, a dryer, and treating \nequipment.\n\nIn the mixing systems, hydrogen is mixed with nitrogen to produce a 5% \nhydrogen, 95% nitrogen mixture (identified as HN).  This HN mixture is used \nfor producing a reducing atmosphere in the annealing furnaces to prevent \noxidation of the steel at high temperatures.  The pure hydrogen and the HN \nflows are adjusted to control the HN concentration in the furnaces to the \nappropriate value for efficient annealing. \n\nIn addition to supplying HN to the furnaces for annealing, HN is stored in a \npurge gas storage system.  The purge system consists of three purge tanks, \ntwo having a capacity of 2500 cubic feet, and one having a capacity of 1650 \ncubic feet.  The purge tanks provide an emergency deluge of 5% HN to the \ntwo galvanizing furnaces that uses a 30% hydrogen atmosphere.

Using census data from LandView III, the \nestimated population within the worst-case scenario circle is 52,000.
