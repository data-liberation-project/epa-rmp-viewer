Trained Refrigeration Technicians are available to respond to any situation requiring emergency actions.\n\nB) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThis process is a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant.\n\nC) The worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the loss of the entire contents of the largest ammonia receiving vessel during a ten-minute period.  The release would be mitigated by the building structure.  Administrative controls to mitigate a release such as emergency shut down procedures have been developed, and the operators have been trained on those procedures.  This scenario is required by EPA to assume unfavorable atmospheric conditions such as a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class of F.  The affected zone would find an endpoint at 0.80 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on a more relistic release from a pipe leak inside the compressor room.  This release also would be mitigated by the building structure and the emergency shut down procedures which have been developed and implemented.  This scenario assumes more realistic atmospheric conditions such as a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class of D.  The affected zone would find an endpoint at 0.10 miles.  With the prevailing winds, the endpoint would not extend beyond the site property boundary.\n\nD) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical "
