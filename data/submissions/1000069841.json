The nearest residential area is approximately 0.5 miles to the NW. Niacet is a major producer of metal organic acid salts such as Calcium Propionate, Sodium Acetate, and Sodium Phenoxyacetate (SPA) which is used inn the production of Penicillin and Sodium Stearoly Lactylate which is an food grade emulsifier. Niacet produces Monochloroacetic acid which is a raw material for SPA, and is also sold on the merchant market. Chlorine is used to produce Monochloroacetic acid. Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is a by product of monochloroacetic acid manufacture. Niacet has 2 10,000 gallon AHCl storage tanks that can hold a maximum of 70,000 lbs each for a total of 140,000 lbs. Niacet may fill one 21,000 lb anhydrous hydrogen chloride tube trailer at a time from the process. The tube trailer consists of seven 3,000 lb capacity tubes. The filled tube trailer is then released for delivery to customers. 600lb and 60 lb cylinders are also filled and released for delivery to customers. Safety systems include hydrogen chloride sensors, automatic shutoff valves, and video monitors.  Ethyl ether is used to manufacture  anionic surfactants. Chlorine is received via railcar and transferred through a vaporizer into 1 of 2 reactors for the production of Monochloroacetic acid. Niacet may have up to 2 chlorine railcars on site for a total of 360,000 lbs. Safety systems include chlorine sensors, automatic shutoff valves, and video monitors.

Offsite consequence analysis for a worst case scenario for ethyl ether does not affect areas outside of the facility. The ethyl ether is a processing aid which is recycled and reused in these processes. Safety systems include heat sensors that can activate a water deluge system, sprinklers, and LEL monitors and alarms. Niacet has a management system in place to oversee the implementation of the RMP program elements.
