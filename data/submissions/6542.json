The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 27,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted Terra has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.                                                                                             In addition, this facility stores 24% aqua ammonia in four 30,000-gallon storage tanks. Therefore, the total facility aqua ammonia storage capacity is 260,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 65,000 pounds. An alternative scenario for aqua was evaluated, but it was determined that the greatest potential off site impact would involve anhydrous ammonia rather than aqua ammonia.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. In addition, this facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia"

In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nTerra's Corporate Mission states to provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public.

These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training, and act as the location's contact with the corporate EHS group. The site safety coordinator acts as the location's emergency contact.\n\n\n Description of our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThis facility is a regional manufacturing and storage terminal. We receive and use anhydrous ammonia and process it into aqua ammonia and react with acid to manufacture ammonium polyphosphate solutions. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank [1 @ 30,000] on site.  The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tank is 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia may be stored temporarily in up to two rail cars. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that may be stored in rail cars is 320,000 pounds.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity is 460,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 160,000 pounds.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 80 ton rail car, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact. It should be noted that Terra has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from any dis"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.
