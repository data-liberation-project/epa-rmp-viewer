Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGeorgia Gulf Corporation, Plaquemine Facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property and the environment.\n  \n2.        The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of Aromatic Chemicals, Electrochemicals and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resins.  We have three regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine, Vinyl chloride monomer and anhydrous ammonia.  Chlorine is used in the manufacture of vinyl chloride monomer.  Vinyl chloride is used for feedstock in the manufacture of PVC resin. Anhydrous Ammonia is used in bio feed for water treatment.\n \n\n3.        The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention  Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention and process safety managements programs that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nGeorgia Gulf maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOur facility conducts compreh"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\" and/or\"What If\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, maintenance and environmental, health and safety, and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,  we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to workers involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGeorgia Gulf  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently at intervals determined by the complexity of the process and employee input.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGeorgia Gulf carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process ch"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification prior to working with the modified process.  In addition operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at  Georgia Gulf.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nIncident Investigation\nGeorgia Gulf  promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. All incidents are inputted electronically on our Corporate Event Tracking System (ETS) system. These incidents are shared company wide and provide a tool for \"lessons learned\" throughout the corporation. We use the Apollo Root Cause methodology to investigate all incidents that meet the companys set criteria.\n\nEmployee Participation\nWe believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. Georgia Gulf developed a Safety Involvement team (SIT) and a Unit Safety Involvement Team (USIT) to increase employee involvement. Both teams provide value in Employee Participation. They focus on updating safety procedures, plant inspections, unit and plant safety issues and they are a voice to Management concerning plant safety issues. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   Georgia Gulf Corporation, Plaquemine Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n \n4.        Five-year Accident History\n\nGeorgia Gulf Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one accidental release of a regulated substance that meets the RMP requirements has occurred during this period.\nThe release took place on 09/27/2003 from a power failure  which over pressured several reactors involving a release of approximately 55,656 lb. of Vinyl Chloride   No deaths or injuries occurred on or offsite. Shelter in place from the community was not necessary. The incident produced damage to process equipment totaling $ 68,545.00\n  \n5.        Emergency Response Plan\nGeorgia Gulf  has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
