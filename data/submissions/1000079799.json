We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  Several programs have been developed and implemented to address accidental release prevention and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and neighbors and protection of the environment.  The Hamilton Facility has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Program for protecting public health and the environment. \r\n \r\nThe Tronox Hamilton Facility is situated on approximately 3,000 acres in Monroe County, near the town of Hamilton, Mississippi, and produces titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment.  Chlorine is used to manufacture TiO2, and as a processing aid in the cooling towers and water treatment systems.  Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) is produced as an intermediate product during the pigment production process.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has prepared a worst case scenario for chlorine and an alternative release scenario for titanium tetrachloride.\r\n\r\nAs required by RMP, the toxic worst case scenario involves emptying a vessel containing 180,000 pounds of chlorine over a period of 10 minutes under meteorological conditions of 105F and 73% relative humidity at night.  The model predicted the chlorine would reach the endpoint concentration after traveling 4.4 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for titanium tetrachloride was assumed to consist of the release of 2 selas preheaters.  This scenario was modeled with EPA RMP* Comp, and it indicated an endpoint concentration would be reached at 0.9 miles.\r\n\r\nThe facility has taken numerous steps to prevent releases from its operations.  Some of these include installation of pressure relief valves and excess flow valves on storage tanks.  Water deluge systems and diking of tanks and vessels have been utilized.  Standard"

Key elements include: \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - chemical hazards, process technology and equipment information is documented, maintained, and available to personnel; \r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis - process hazard analyses are conducted at least every five years to identify hazards of the process, review previous incidents with potential catastrophic consequences, engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazard and their application to provide early warning of releases, consequences of failure of such controls,  source siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of possible safety, health and environmental consequences as a result of failure of controls;\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date; \r\n\r\nOperator Training/Certification Program - the facility has a training and testing program that provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process; \r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures - the plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely; \r\n\r\nMaintenance Training - the facility trains personnel that will be performing routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment; \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity - Vessels and other process equipment are periodically tested and/or inspected, following recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements, to ensure safe operation; \r\n\r\nManagement of Change - The facility has a management system to ensure modified facilities and processes will be safe to operate; \r\n\r\nP"

Onsite HazMat Fire/Rescue team members are trained in the use of the necessary personal protective equipment needed to respond to accidental releases of all substances at the facility.  EMR/EMT team members are trained in the proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures.

On 5/29/18, liquid chlorine line between the railcar unloading station and the vaporizer over-pressured.  This over-pressure resulted in the rupture disc bursting.  The rupture disc holder released approximately 92 pounds of chlorine into the atmosphere.  The escape of chlorine was through a tell-tale port in the rupture disc holder that did not have a plug in place at the time of operation of the rupture disc.  Twenty four (24) workers were given first aid at the nurse's station onsite, and one worker was treated at the hospital.  There were no off-site consequences or impacts as a result of this release.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility's Emergency Response and Security Plan is maintained with our Safety Procedures.  This plan provides procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.
