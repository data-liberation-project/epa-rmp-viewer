Target assumed a partnership with SUPERVALU in March 2007 during which time SUPERVALU was responsible for day to day activities of the building. On September 18, 2011 Target assumed control of operations and is responsible for the daily maintenance and operations of the building.\n\nThe facility was built in 3 phases, 1977, 1983 and 1995 for Fry's Foods Inc, a division of the Kroger Company.  The facility was most recently operated by Atlas Cold Storage Holdings until May 2006.  The facility was then bought under a purchase option from Dillon Real Estate Company (a subsidiary of the Kroger Companies) by Atlas Cold Storage Holdings on May 12, 2006 and sold on the same day to KTR Arizona LLC. KTR initiated and contracted for a number of renovation projects impacting facility refrigeration systems between September 2006 and March 2007 as part of a lease agreement with Target Corporation to prepare the facility for current operations.  These projects included the following:\n\n-    Renovation of the Perishable Building Engine Room. \n\n-    Modifications to refrigeration piping and evaporators north of Perishable Building Engine Room.\n\n-    Modifications to refrigeration piping and evaporators south of Perishable Building Engine Room. \n\n-    Removal of ice making equipment from the Freezer Building.\n\n-    Replacement of the Freezer Building refrigeration system evaporative condensers.\n\n-    Major Compressor overhauls and repairs for the Freezer Building refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nDuring the time starting approximately November 2006, when KTR Arizona LLC was renovating the facility, Target audited the appl"

Target found it to be incomplete, inadequate and not appropriate for compliance of the new operating entities. SUPERVALU in partnership with Target established new PSM and RMP programs for the facility. Upon announcement of the dissolution of partnership with SUPERVALU in July 2011, a team of Target team members specializing in PSM and refrigeration reviewed the existing program and outlined a number of improvements to be completed by both Target and SUPERVALU team members. Target assumed building operations on September 18, 2011 under a new Process Safety Management Plan in accordance to all federal, local, and state regulations.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system and other equipment is an ever present risk to the health of team members and the community. Target is committed to safety at every level.  Target's prevention solutions include both technology as well as an active business unit that is qualified to monitor and manage the refrigeration and PSM program. \n\nThe revised Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP)are living documents, defining the administrative and operational processes to be utilized during and after the facility's turnover, September 18, 2011.  Target also reserves the right to modify and adapt its PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our business processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs is to minimize or eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\n\n-    Human error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems. \n\n-    Human error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system components.\n\n-    Lack of knowledge regarding ammonia refrigeration systems a"

In general, element guidelines describe the following:\n\n-    Functions of individual elements.\n\n-    Repeatable processes to be followed.\n\n-    Utilization of employee resources.\n\n-    Contingency plans for emergencies.\n\n-    Measures to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.\n\n-    Method to evaluate risk associated with ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n-    Maintenance and update of PSM elements.\n\n-    Provisions for feedback and continuous improvement.\n\nThe program is complex and has been developed by integrating facility safety programs with maintenance management, facility operations, and human resources management.\n\nAt the Phoenix Food Distribution Center T-3893, Target is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, covering design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Target has proactively partnered with Phoenix Fire Department to insure that properly trained and equipped hazmat responders are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release.

The vast majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  The RMP regulated substance present at the facility is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as refrigerant in closed-loop refrigeration systems.  The facility is serviced by 2 independent refrigeration systems, a Perishable Building system, total charge inventory of 9,920 lbs and the Freezer Building system, total charge inventory of 12,000 pounds.  The refrigeration systems do not interconnect nor are their major storage vessels rest in close proximity to one another.  As a result, it is unlikely that the charge of both systems could be discharged without a disaster scenario which would encompass the entire site such as a natural disaster or well planned act of aggression.\n\nIn a worst case release scenario involving the entire site, release of total charge from both refrigeration systems needs to be considered for the purposes of this RMP.  The combined total inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 21,920 pounds.  \n\nDue to the  and characteristics of the building's ammonia systems as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this building is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n3.
