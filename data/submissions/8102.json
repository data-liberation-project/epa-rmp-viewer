The CFF facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented CFF's HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response plan includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response plan, CFF emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, CFF has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as a evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the CFF HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the CFF facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Clinton Fire Department, ambulance, police, sheriff and highway patrol in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nCFF is a producer of prepared frozen food products, specifically chicken and turkey products.  The NAICS code for these processes at this facil"

Many areas of the plant are refrigerated for processing and product storage.  \n\nCFF has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 14,008 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Con Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) plant in Clinton, Arkansas.\n\n\n3.0    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n Worst-case scenario \n\nThe largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a puncture in the liquid portion of the high pressure receiver.  For the purposes of this scenario, this puncture would occur during an ammonia inventory pump-down where all of the ammonia in the system is pumped to the high pressure receiver.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver and interconnecting pipework is 14,008 pounds. There are no applicable administrative controls or passive mitigation.  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\nThe alternative scenario that is most likely to occur at the facility would be an ammonia release from the rupture of the safety relief valve that is attached to the high pressure receiver.  The valve is set at a pressure of 250 psig and allows the gas to discharge out of a pipe located above the roof.   The release would reach endpoints offsite and nearby public receptors.  There are no applicable administrative controls or passive mitigation.  Active mitigation of the release would be through human intervention.  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. \n\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCon Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) has developed an OSHA PSM  program for th"

At CFF, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, CFF's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The ammonia PSM program at CFF includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for  working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.    CFF has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop the \"ConAgra Frozen Foods - Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Manual\".  Block flow diagrams and P&ID's have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n3.    CFF has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees)  responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n4.    In the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the  PSM document).  Necessary "

      "SummaryText": "preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n\n5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of CFF's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 1999.  To date, there has been one accidental release involving ammonia at the Clinton facility according to 40 CFR 68.42 (a).  Details of the incident are located in the Data Elements Section 6.\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned previously, the CFF facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER (document located at the plant).  The sections of the HAZWOPER document contain detailed procedures for pre-emergency planning and coordination, personnel roles and lines of authority, training, communication, emergency recognition and prevention, safe distances and places of refuge, site security and control, emergency alerting and response procedures, ammonia decontamination, emergency medical treatment and first aid, critique of response and follow-up, personal protective and emergency equipment, and medical surveillance.\n\nCFF's emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n7.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished.
