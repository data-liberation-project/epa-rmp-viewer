Over the past five years there have been no accidental releases.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information \n\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process. \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant is coordinated with the St. Mary Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Calumet Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC, and other emergency response organizations.  The Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.   \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant resolv"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices \n\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant has longstanding safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precaution"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.  \n\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant is located in St. Mary parish, Louisiana.  The plant is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC, and operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.  \n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.

These purified streams are then processed into three products:  residue gas, de-methanized natural gas liquid, and condensate.  Residue gas is routed back to their respective feed pipeline for distribution and sales; condensate is transported via tank truck to outside consumers, and natural gasoline liquid is transported via pipeline to the Enterprise Pro-Mix Fractionation Plant at Napoleonville, Louisiana for additional processing.    \n\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  \n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant are absorption oil enriched with the recovered products (rich oil), raw make (flammable mixture), propane, and natural gas.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program. \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary, but rather is reflected in the data components.
