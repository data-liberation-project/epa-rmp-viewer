(Air Liquide), El Segundo Hydrogen Plant must extend beyond the gates. As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area. Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\n\n1.2 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THIS RMP\nAir Liquide (AL) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the stationary hydrogen production plant for its facility located at the Chevron El Segundo Refinery.  The RMP was developed and submitted to comply with Program 3 requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program pursuant to Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (19CCR), Section 2735.6 and the Federal regulation 40 CFR 68.   Pursuant to 19CCR 2735.6 and 40 CFR 68, a management system has been developed for the site.  The Facility Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of CalARP/RMP accident prevention program elements.  This position has direct supervisory responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the hydrogen production plant.  Key technical groups within Air Liquide support the development and implementation of some prevention program elements.  The operators and I&E technicians will be responsible for day-to-day operation and maintenance of the hydrogen facility.  An organizational chart for the facility as well as job descriptions can be found in the site procedure.\n\n1.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe AL plant is located at 1310 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, California, 90245 on the Chevron Refinery property.  The facility?s mailing address is 214 Main St., El Segundo, California, 90245.  The Hydrogen Facility?s size is approximately 3.5 acres, and it "

However, to the South, residential property is located within approximately 0.4 miles.  Also, no environmental receptors have been identified within this area. \nThe products from the plant are hydrogen and steam.  The unit produces raw hydrogen, which is then purified.  \nThere are four types of feed stock for the unit: pentane, natural gas, refinery fuel gas, and anhydrous ammonia.  The plant is designed to operate for 9 months with pentane feed, refinery fuel gas, and ammonia. While the plant is to operate the remaining 3 months of the year with natural gas, refinery fuel gas, and ammonia feedstock.  Continuous operation with a mixture of all four types of feedstock is not foreseen.  The fuel for the reformer furnace is off-gas from the PSA unit, supplemented with refinery fuel gas or natural gas.\nThe pentane reformer feedstock meets the criteria for classification as a flammable mixture pursuant to the regulations at CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2770.2 (b)(2).  The total quantity of pentane flammable mixture present at the facility is 33,264 pounds.  The pentane flammable mixture consists of butane (CAS# 106-97-8), isopentane (CAS# 78-78-4), and pentane (CAS# 109-66-0). The predominant component in this mixture is isopentane.  The quantity of pentane, as a flammable mixture, exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for both the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n1.4 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nTo meet the Federal RMP and the CalARP regulations, the Facility must analyze one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to the end point resulting from an accidental release of regulated flammable and toxic substances from covered processes under worst-case conditions.  Administrative controls and passive mitigation devices are present to mitigate off-site consequ"

Additionally, under the Federal RMP and the CalARP regulations, the Facility must analyze a most credible Alternative Release Scenario (ARS).  Historical data from Industry reportable chemical accidents were reviewed to ensure a credible event was chosen.  In the ARS passive mitigation was applied in the off-site consequence analysis.  All modeling was done with USEPA RMP*Comp version 1.07.\n\n1.4.1 WCS Flammable\nThe pentane feedstock meets the criteria for classification as a flammable mixture pursuant to the regulations at CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2770.2 (b)(2).  The total quantity of pentane flammable mixture present at the facility is 33,264 pounds.  The pentane flammable mixture consists of butane, isopentane, and pentane.  The predominant component in this mixture is isopentane.  The largest quantity of this flammable mixture contained in a single location within the facility is at the pentane feed surge drum, V-100.  The maximum quantity of flammable mixture that could be contained in this vessel has been estimated at 30,272 pounds.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a flammable material at the plant is a catastrophic failure of the feed surge drum.  The WCS has been modeled such that the entire contents of this vessel are released as a vapor within 10 minutes.  \n\nThe estimated impacts (distance to endpoint) from the worst-case release scenario involving the flammable mixture extends to 0.2 miles.  Within this circle of 0.2 miles radius, there are no residential receptors.  However, there are public receptors located on the Chevron Refinery at the Isomax control room and offices.  The potentially affected number of receptors at these locations is 42.\n\n1.4.2 WCS Toxic\nThere is no data to report.

The flange leak is modeled at a release rate of 1010 pounds per minute based upon the release of the entire contents of the vessel into the dike area within 30 minutes.  The contents of the dike ignite resulting in a pool fire. \n\nThe estimated impacts (distance to endpoint) from the ARS involving isopentane extends to 0.04 miles.  This distance is based on a heat radiation end point of 5 kilowatts per square meter.  Within this circle of 0.04 miles radius, there are no residential receptors.

The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the El Segundo Hydrogen Facility.  This summary addresses each of the CalARP and EPA RMP prevention program elements. \n\n1.5.1 Employee Participation\nManagement alone cannot insure safety or protection of the environment. There should be no doubt that each employee must also demonstrate their concern and acknowledge their responsibility in these areas.  At the El Segundo Hydrogen Facility, employees are required to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the site procedure.  This procedure details the participation of employees in process hazard analysis (PHA), pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), and being involved in incident investigations concerning the plant.

These procedures are reviewed periodically and certified as required.  \n\n1.5.5 Training\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the El Segundo Hydrogen Facility has implemented a formal training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive training on general orientation, site rules and practices, familiarization with the site, use of safety procedures and equipment, accident investigation and emergency procedures.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  In addition to the hands on work, classroom instruction is conducted on process safety information, standard operating procedures, safety consideration and the Emergency Action Plan.  Newly assigned operators must pass the operator training program and they are evaluated within 6 months.  After an operator has demonstrated adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition operators are required to attend refresher course training that includes a review of standard operating procedures, HAZCOM, safe handling procedures and incident/accident procedures.  Training is documented and tracked in a training matrix for each operator.  Oral and written tests are used to verify that the operator understands the training.\n\n1.5.6 Contractors\nThe El Segundo Hydrogen Facility uses contractors to supplement its own work force when maintenance activities exceed the capabilities or time available for the opera"

It may also include changes to structural components depending on their effect on the process; (3) Changes in process chemicals, catalysts, manufacturing processes or technology; (4) Software changes to control systems for equipment and processes.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n1.5.8 Mechanical Integrity\nThe El Segundo Hydrogen Facility has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valve and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment, which will help prevent and/or limit consequences of potential offsite impacts to the community.  The general maintenance philosophy of AL is that all maintenance be planned through preventative maintenance programs and performed during scheduled shutdowns.\n\n1.5.9 Safe Work Practices\nAL and the El Segundo Hydrogen Facility have safe work practices in place to help ensure employee and process safety.  These procedures comprise a group of corporate standards under the ?Life Safety? procedures implemented at all locations.  Procedures in place include:  (1) Energy Control and Isolation, (2) Safe Work Permit, (3) Hot Work Permit, and (4) Confined Space Entry Permit.  These procedures along with others maintained by the AL Health, Safety and Environmental department, along with training of affected personnel and periodic audits, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n1.5.10 Ma"

      "SummaryText": "nagement of Change\nAL has established requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change (MOC) procedure.  This procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact, and approving planned deviations from procedure.  The AL MOC system is a systematic process designed to help prevent inadvertent, unintended or unauthorized changes that may cause unsafe conditions, product quality problems, process hazards, unplanned outages, etc.  This standard also helps to ensure that changes are technically sound and that Quality and HSE safeguards originally designed into the facility are either maintained or enhanced. \n\n1.5.11 Incident Investigation\nAL defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and Reporting procedure.  The purpose of incident investigation and reporting is to identify root causes and correct them rather than simply addressing the symptom of the incident.  Incident investigation and reporting is one of the primary methods used to continuously improve our operations by sharing information, identifying root causes, and implementing corrective actions, per the corporate procedure.   The plant manager is responsible for tracking significant incidents and corrective actions through completion.   Results of the incident investigation and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings.  Reports are retained for at least 5 years to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n1.5.12 Compliance Audits\nTo help insure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the El Segundo Hydrogen Facility is audited by a team on a basis of at least every 3 years.

Recommendations and findings from the Audit team must be resolved in a timely manner.  The plant manager is responsible for obtaining engineering support to correct or modify the system based on the accepted recommendations.  Resolutions to these recommendations are documented.  Once the resolutions have been completed, communication of the corresponding changes is made to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.  \n\n1.6 CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the El Segundo Hydrogen Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the CalARP/RMP covered ammonia and pentane systems in the plant.  These prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\nIn addition to the accident prevention program, the Hydrogen Facility has safety features designed to (1) quickly detect the release, (2) contain/control the release; (3) reduce the consequence of (mitigate) a release.  \nThe following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n1.6.1 Release Containment/Control \nA containment dike has been installed to mitigate the release of pentane from the feed surge vessel, V-100 and another containment dike has been installed to mitigate the release of anhydrous ammonia from the anhydrous ammonia system.  A remote automatic fuse-able type isolation valve has been installed in the anhydrous ammonia line at the battery limits.  This valve can be closed from the control room.  This valve will automatically close due to a fire or a large pressure drop due to a leak.  \n\n1.6.2 Release Mitigation\nTwelve firewater monitors have been installed on the perimeter of the facility a"
