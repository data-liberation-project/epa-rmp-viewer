A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe Cognis Corporation Maudlin, SC facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from Greenville County emergency response organizations.    Although the facility's programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release - the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.  \n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (\"the worst case\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative cases\").  Although it is technically infeasible for the worst case described in this report to occur, worst case information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenarios, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using PHAST software.  PHAST is a very sophisticated, EPA-recognized program specifically designed for accidental chemical "

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternate release scenarios (ARSs).  Based on facility design and prevention programs, the facility does not believe the worst-case release scenario could ever occur.  Although it is also highly unlikely that the ARS would occur, the ARS represents a release that is more likely to occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Mauldin facility. \n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The concentration at the endpoint represents the maximum concentration below which nearly all people can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms which could impair the ability to take protection action. \n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) at the Mauldin facility is a catastrophic failure in the ethylene oxide (EO) storage tank resulting in a release of 221,000 pounds of EO over a 10-minute period.  The EO tank is below grade in an open vault, which serves as a dike.  In the event of a release, the vault/dike would co"

Although the facility has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures were taken into account when calculating the distance to the endpoint.  In other words, the facility has provided the worst case estimate of the impact area.\n\nThe facility has modern, redundant systems designed to prevent this scenario from ever happening.  These systems are described in further detail in the section on Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for EO is a failure of the seal in the loading arm boom attached to the rail car during the EO unloading process, resulting in a release of 1044 pounds over 60 minutes.  The 60-minute release duration is the approximate time needed to identify and stop the release.  Failure of the seal was chosen as the potential release because, historically, seals have been a release point for operations of this type in the chemical industry.

Collectively, these programs prevent accidental releases caused by equipment failure or human error.  Following is a summary of the general accident prevention program at the facility:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Mauldin facility understands that employee involvement is crucial to the success of an accident prevention program.  The facility aggressively encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, reviewing chemical safety information, and participating in process hazard analyses (PHAs).  Employees have access to extensive process and chemical safety information.  Employee involvement in safety programs is documented in the facility's Process Safety Manual.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSafe operation of a process starts with a detailed identification of the hazards associated with the process.

To do this, each process at the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of trained personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nPHA team findings are submitted to the plant manager for resolution.  Implementation of mitigating options in response to PHAs is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIn order to operate a process safely, facility personnel need accurate, detailed informat"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available in the Process Safety Section of the PSM Manual. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) within the batch cards and operating procedures. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process that is explained in greater detail in a subsequent section.\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains batch cards and operating procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper and lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.
