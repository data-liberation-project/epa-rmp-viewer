This Risk Management Plan has been developed for The City of Breaux Bridge's Water Treatment Plant in accordance with 40 CFR part 68.  This facility is subject to the requirements of this program due to the usage and storage of chlorine in an amount greater than 2,500 lbs.\n\nThe facility is located within the city limits of Breaux Bridge, LA on Washington Street at the intersection of St. Phillips St. The area surrounding the plant is residential with the Bayou Teche on the northeastern boarder.  The latitude and longitude of the facility was obtained using a hand-held  Garmin 75 GPS device with an accuracy of +/- 100 meters.  The facility is easily visible on the USGS quadrangle map entitled Breaux Bridge, LA.\n\nThe facility treats and supplies water to residential and commercial entities located in Breaux Bridge.  This treatment includes the chlorination of the water supply prior to being distributed throughout the city.  The rate of chlorine injected into the water is automatically regulated and varies based on the current needs.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water it is diluted to an amount which is less than 1% chlorine by weight.  Therefore, the process that is subject to the RMP requirements begins with the chlorine supply (3-1 ton cylinders) and ends at the point of injection into the water.  The facility purchases the pre-filled chlorine cylinders from Harcros Chemicals, Inc. approximately once every three months.  \n\nThe threshold quantity for chlorine under 40 CFR part 68 is 2,500 lbs. The water plant stores a maximum of three-one ton cylinders (6,000 lbs.) at any one time. The cylinders are located within a chain-linked fence on the northeast side of Washington St. and adjacent to the plant's office building.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)-Determination of worst-case release quantity.

      "SummaryText": "type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic natural disaster or the collapse of nearby equipment onto the chlorine cylinders.  A release of 2,000 lbs. for a duration of 10 minutes results in a 1.3 mile distance to the toxic endpoint.  This endpoint, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, is the location where minimal effects of exposure to the toxic substance are likely to occur.  This distance encompasses the entire city of Breaux Bridge from the waste water treatment plant to approximately 1.1 mile east on Hwy 347 and from Hwy 31 just after Cormier Dr. to Hwy 328 just before Doyle Melancon Rd.  According to a January 1999 letter from the Treasurer of the State of Louisiana the population of Breaux Bridge is approximately 7,600. \n\nAn alternative case or a more likely release of chlorine could occur as a result of a valve, regulator seal, or gasket leak, or from a small amount of liquefied chlorine being trapped between the valve of the cylinder and the equipment line attachment.  The plant is manned 24 hr/day and is equipped with a leak detection system with sensors located near the chlorine cylinders and in the injection room.  The injection system is also equipped with a device that automatically closes the valves at the cylinders if a loss in pressure within the injection line is detected.  If a 1 ppm leak is detected an alarm will sound and according to facility personnel, it would take less than 1 minute to respond by closing the flow valve and thus stopping the leak.   Assuming the chlorine flashes to the atmosphere at a rate of 0.5 ft3/min for a maximum of 5 minutes (0.5 lbs. of chlorine) the distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 mile.  The area within a 0.1 mile radius from the point of release extends along Washington St. from Berard Rd. to just after St. Phillips St. and from 100 ft on the east side of Bayou Teche to just before HWY 31.  Based on a  maximum population density of 8,268 p/mi2, the population within 0.1"

This type of release is only expected to impact those persons in the immediate vicinity of the chlorine cylinders.  \n\nThe facility has not experienced a release which caused on or off site injury, death or property damage within the past five years.  \n\nFacility employees are properly trained in the operating and maintenance procedures.  These procedures are kept on-site in the O & M Manuals developed by Domingue-Szabo & Associates, Inc.  Records of inspections, testing, and maintenance are also kept on file at the facility.  In addition to the leak detection system the process is also equipped with an automatic shut-off system.  If a change in pressure within the injection line is detected the system automatically closes the flow valve at  the chlorine tank.\n\nWritten emergency response procedures are kept on file at the facility.  The emergency response procedures describe actions for incidental response for facility personnel in the event of a relatively small leak or release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  If incidental response activities do not halt the release or the release poses an immediate safety or health hazard, specially trained response personnel are contacted to take over response activities.  In the event of a chlorine leak or release, employees are instructed to assess the situation and to determine if it is safe to discontinue the leak without the help of emergency responders.  If there are any doubts as to the safety of the release, the employees are to initiate the written notification procedures.  \n\nCurrent safety features installed at the facility include the leak detection system and 24 hr/day on-site personnel. Inspections of the process and associated equipment are conducted on a regular basis to avoid failure and detect normal wear and tear of equipment parts.  Future safety precautions that may be implemented at the plant involve construction a cover to protect the chlori"
