      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction \nChemicals are widely used in industry and in the home, as well as present in the environment.  They are transported on roads, waterways, and railways.  We at the Northeast Water Pollution Control Plant (Northeast WPCP) use chemicals too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our treated wastewater to provide safe discharge to the Delaware River. We also produce methane as a part of our wastewater treatment process. Storing large quantities of chlorine and methane can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and methane as seriously as we do providing the effective, safe treatment of wastewater.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and Northeast WPCP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Northeast WPCP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from rail cars. The plant sludge digestion system produces methane as a by-product of the process. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental relea"

The Northeast WPCP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\nThe Northeast WPCP, operating since 1929, is located at 3899 Richmond Street in the City of Philadelphia. The plant is located on property between Interstate 95 and the Betsy Ross Bridge in the Bridesburg section of Philadelphia.  Wastewater treated at the Northeast WPCP is disinfected with chlorine and discharged to the Delaware River.  The treated wastewater meets all EPA standards. This wastewater treatment includes preliminary screening, primary settlement and treatment, secondary sedimentation and treatment, and chlorination before final discharge.  The Northeast WPCP discharges up to 315 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated wastewater, with an average flow of 200 MGD.\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations.Liquid chlorine is brought to the plant via rail lines that enter the plant property. Chlorine leak detector monitors continuously check for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination rooms. Other indicators include chlorine feed and evaporator alarms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control room. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, an evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valve is designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.  These valves also reduce pressu"

All process related, factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the integrity of the equipment.\nThe rail car storage area is covered for sun protection and the chlorination room is enclosed in the effluent pumping station building.  The chlorination room is equipped with an automatic ventilation system that activates when the chlorine leak detector detects 2 ppm of chlorine in the room.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building.  The rail car storage area and the effluent pumping station both have Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) available.   \nThe facility also currently produces methane as a by-product of its wastewater treatment process. Methane is a regulated flammable substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's methane storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP Regulations.\nMethane is produced at the plant as a result of the digestion of sludge from the wastewater treatment process. This is a naturally occurring process that happens in swamps and other locations.  Methane leak detector monitors continuously check for leaks in the digester tank areas and in the process rooms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control room. In the case of a leak, each area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light to indicate the presence of methane above safety threshold limits. The leak detectors are set to alarm at 20% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) for methane that is well below potential explosive levels. \nThe sludge digesters and storage tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves that enhance the safety of the system.  The process rooms are equipped with a ventilation system that operates continuously to ensure no build-up of digester gas that could pose an explosive concern. \nThe Northeast WPCP is controlled at one main entrance on Richmond Street.

The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and alarms notify staff of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations at all times.      \nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst case scenario assumes that the entire content of the largest single container of chlorine is released, regardless of how improbable that may be.  In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods, such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered.  Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas.\n An alternative release scenario is also required.  \nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine is focused on the 90-ton rail cars that store chlorine liquid. The scenario used for Northeast WPCP is the rupture of one chlorine rail car with a maximum capacity of 90 tons, resulting in a release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration. The chlorine rail cars are stored in an area that is not totally enclosed, so no building mitigation factor can be applied at Northeast WPCP. The release rate for this scenario is 18,000 pounds per minute (lbs/min).    \nThe rail car rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake. In practice this type of total release of a rail car would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\nThe alternative release reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur, as compared to the worst c"

Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.  Lastly, the alternative release scenario assumes more realistic regional and seasonal meteorology.\nBased on the process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine system, several alternative release scenarios were selected.  Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The scenario used for chlorine was a failure of the excess flow valve on the chlorine rail car with no mitigation. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 126.0 lbs/min. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the worst alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a slight offsite impact. \nThe worst-case release scenario for methane is focused on the 110-foot diameter sludge digesters that produces the gas. The scenario used for Northeast WPCP is a release of 2887 pounds of methane and an instantaneous explosion hazard.    \nThe explosion could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an airplane crashing into the digester. In practice this type of an explosion would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The results of the worst-case release analysis indicate that this scenario has a slight offsite impact.  Thus, alternative release scenario is required for this process.\nThe alternative release scenario for methane is focused on the waste gas flares that burn excess methane from the sludge digestion process. The scenario is the failure of the pilot light on a single flare, causing a release of methane to the surrounding environment.  This release scenario shows no explosion hazard due to the release of methane from an unlit flare.\nFive-year Accident"

Some minor, incidental releases may have occurred over this period, but they were quickly handled by staff or posed no safety or health hazards. \nThere was a single release on-site during the past 5-years that affected a single employee working on a chlorine solution drain line at the plant.  The employee affected received minor medical treatment and returned to work the next day.  There was no other damage resulting from this small incidental release. \nNo explosions/fires from methane that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at on-site or off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Northeast WPCP during the last five years. \nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \nNortheast WPCP is in compliance with Federal Risk Management Planning (RMP) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and methane, and the presence of chlorine and methane detectors and alarms. \nNortheast WPCP's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n* Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders,  and contractors\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n* Completion of a hazard review of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n* Use of s"

This information was compiled from numerous sources and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data about these substances.  This information includes chlorine and methane background information, material safety data sheets (MSDS), and chlorine and methane reaction chemistry.\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine and methane processes.  Specifications for the process are collected in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\nWe also have procedures in place that is triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\nHazard Analysis \nIn 1998, a detailed hazard analysis (HA) was conducted with plant staff, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated processes.  The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was the \"What-If\" scenario and process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period, or whenever there is major change in the process.

Northeast WPCP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine and digester gas system.  Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid and correct deviations.  Northeast WPCP will update procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures will be developed and in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or a changed process starting back up.\nOperations and Maintenance Training Program\nEach Northeast WPCP employee presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine and digester gas processes is trained in an overview of the process and detailed, applicable operating and maintenance procedures.  In fact, Northeast WPCP helps their employees understand, through training, the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine on site, and to increase their employees awareness with respect to their hazards. Northeast WPCP's training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers 1) a general overview of the processes, 2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and 3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.

Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff, added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures, and passed on to the training unit for their inclusion in existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent a future event.\nEmergency Response Program Summary\nNortheast WPCP has established a written emergency response program that is followed by the employees to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  This program has been coordinated with the City of Philadelphia Fire Department HAZMAT Unit, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted at a minimum frequency of every 12 months; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA few minor changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the chlorine and digester gas processes in 1998 during the hazard review process.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and will be implemented as required.  It is expected that the recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented by December 1999.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes. \nNORTHEAST WPCP\t\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\tRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\n\nNE_RMP_EXECSUMMARY.DOC\tES-7\n\nNE_RMP_EXECSUMMARY.DOC\tES-1"
