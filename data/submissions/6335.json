In this way Nation Pizza Products promotes overall plant, worker and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances (anhydrous ammonia).  These programs are applied to any acitvity involving anhydrous ammonia (refrigeration system).  \n\nChemical on site:  Anhydrous Ammonia used for the refrigeration system \nAmount on Estm. on Site:    44,500  lbs.\n\nAmmonia usage in this facility is for a refrigerant (R717), for decades has been the mainstay refrigerant in the frozen food industry.  The majority of breweries, soft drink plants, dairies, meat packing and commercial fishing fleets continue to favor ammonia as a primary refrigerant.  \n\nLEADING FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA \nSelf Alarming - No refrigerant loss without warning.  If a leak occurs, on-duty personnel immediately will be alerted to needs for corrective action before hundreds of pounds of refrigerant are lost,  or product temperature rises to damaging heights.\nLowest Cost - Cost mujch les than any halocarbon refrigerant.\nEasy to use- Encourages simplicity in design of systmes and controls.\nHighly Efficient - Exhibits greatest net refrigerating effect of all commonly used industrial refrigerants.\nRealtively Safe- Hard to ignite.  Limited explosive potential.\nNon-Polluting- When released to atmosphere.  Made of all natural elements.\n\nAt room temperature and atmospheric pressure, ammonia is a pungent, colorless gas approximately 40% lighter than air.  Compressed and cooled, ammonia gas condenses to a colorless liquid about 68% as heavy as water.  At atmospheri"
