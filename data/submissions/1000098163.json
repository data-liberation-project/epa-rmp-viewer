In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a CNG/LNG (methane) release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWaste Management of Alameda County, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n \r\n-\tsave lives;\r\n-\tminimize and avoid injuries;\r\n-\tprotect the environment; and\r\n-\tminimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, LNG health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency response at this facility will be handled by the Alameda County Fire Department. Facility personnel will not be expected to perform emergency response activities apart from: 1) reporting an incident (LNG leak or fire) when it occurs, 2) activating any facility-wide notification system, and 3) evacuating the facility to a safe location. \r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed in July 2014 for the Altamont LNG Facility, on May 25, 2017 for the LCNG Fueling Station (revalidated on May 10, 2022), and on September 29, 2021 for the Flare System, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Waste Management facility.

The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before LNG is introduced into a new or modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of LNG and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to ensure worker and community safety, the facility includes numerous mechanisms for preventing accidents. These include designing the facility to meet all current design standards (including National Fire Protection Association [NFPA]-59A [Standard for the Production, Storage, and Handling of Liquefied Natural Gas] for the Altamont LNG Facility, NFPA-52 [Vehicular Gaseous Fuel Systems Code] for the LCNG Fueling Station, and those applicable to earthquake safety); regular facility maintenance; worker training regarding facility operation, safe LNG handling procedures, and response to accidents; leak and fire detection systems; emergency shutdown procedures; and compliance audits. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe CalARP Program defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nAn unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n-\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\r\n-\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering"

It is a clean burning fuel.\r\n\r\nAltamont LNG Facility:\r\nThe Altamont LNG facility is owned by Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. and operated by Linde, LLC via High Mountain Fuels, LLC. The primary purpose of this facility is to convert landfill gas to LNG. The LNG will be dispensed at the facility into trucks for transport to an off-site facility where it will be used for fueling vehicles. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum intended inventory of LNG for this process is 180,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nLCNG Fueling Station:\r\nThe LCNG Fueling Station is owned and operated by WM.  The process employed in the fueling station involves converting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to compressed natural gas (CNG), which in turn will be used as a fuel to power solid waste transfer trucks operated by Waste Management. Typical operating conditions range from 60-110 psig on the low pressure LNG system to 4,200 psig on the CNG side.  Construction of the fueling system began in 2011, with operations beginning in March 2012.  The system's maximum intended inventory of 50,750 pounds. \r\n\r\nFlare System:\r\nThe Flare System is owned and operated by WM.  The process employed in the Flare System involves compressed natural gas being sent to the Flare System, where it is flared off safely.
