The plant is located on the east side of the Miami River. As a city department,  the Wastewater Treatment Plant is part of the city's Emergecy Preparedness Plan.  This plan which was written in 1985 and upgraded in 1988 is a comprehensive document which outlines the City's role and procedures for handling all levels of emergencies that might impact residence of the City or surrounding communities.  Presently this emergency preparedness plan is updated annually..\n\nSection 15 of the city's Emergency Response Plan contains the individual unit plans for the departments within the City of Piqua.  Specifically, Section 15.05C deals with Emergency Operation Plan for the Wastwater Plant which operates as a subunit of the Department of Public Works.  As stated in the City's Emergency Preparedness Plan, up to 4 one ton cylnders of chlorine may be stored on site at any given time but only one cylinder is actually in use at any given time.  The physical state of the chorine can best be described as chlorine gas liquefied by pressure.\n\n\nTOXIC WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO\nIn the development of the worst possible scenario accident it is assumed that a 2000 pound tank of chlorine would rupture and discharge the total contents to atmosphere.  Although the likelihood of this occuring would be unlikely, it is possible that a structural failure of the tank itself could possibly cause and event like this to occur.  Of  course, there is even the more remote possibility that a natural disaster such as a tornado could cause all of the tanks of chlorine that are in storage to be destroyed thus the potential for a release of up to 8000 pounds could be possible.  However, the worst possible scenario for the purposes of this document is to be calculated on a release of the larges"

In fact, experience has show us that in the accident of 6-20-98 this was the case and the discharge that resulted was in the form of chlorine gas.  The calculaions for the Toxic Alternate Release Scenario was based on this type of failure.  RMP Comp was used to calculate the endpoints for both this and the Toxic Worst Case.\n\nThe Piqua Waste Water Treatment Facility is located in an Urban Area in the City of Piqua, Ohio.  Many Trees, residences and businesses fall well with a 1/2 mile radius of the facility.  During the normal operation hours of 7am to 3pm Monday thru Friday the facillity is fully staffed.  However, during the following hours only one empoyee is on duty: 3pm to 11pm seven days a week, 11pm to 7 am seven days per week, 7am to 3pm on Sunday.  Two operators are on duty on Saturday 7am to 3pm.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\n\nEMERGENCY EQUIPMENT ON HAND\n\nDynamation Combo Gas Detectors (2)                                                   1 in office, 1 in vehicle S-17\n\nEmergency Life Supporting System (ELSA) 5 minute                              Vehicle S-17\nbreathing apparatus\n\nChlorine Emergency Kit \"B\" for Ton Cylinders  (1)                                    Piqua Fire Department\n\nTorso Safety Harness (2)                                                                          1 in safety cabinet\n                                                                                                               1 in  Vehicle S-17\n\nFresh Air Blower (1)                                                                                   Garage Workshop Area\n\nMotorola Portable Radios (2)          "

This procedure cn be found in Sectin 15.05c-13 of the plan and reads as follows:\nCHLORINE LEAK\nAll operators are instructed not to change chlorine cylinders alone.  They are trained in detecting small leaks that may occur during a routine cylinder change.  In the event of a major leak (i.e. ruptured line, cylinder, or broken valve) the following procedures should be followed:\n\n1.  Evacuate Chlorine Building area Immediately.  Stay upwind.\n\n2.  Contact Fire Department (2011)\n\n3.  DO NOT attempt to repair the leak alone.\n\n4.  A \"Chlorine Emergency Kit B for ton cylinders is located in the Piqua Fire Department.\n\n5.  Depending on wind velocity and direction certain areas around the plant may need to be evacuated.\n\nIn addition to the above procedures it is understood that the OHIO EPA would be notified in the event of a major release of contaminants to the air, land, or water.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY DESCRIPTION\nThere were no accidents in the last five (5) years.  However,  on 9-15-02 a line broke carring chorinated water, causing the water to spill onto the floor.  This triggered the chlorine alarm to go off.  It must be emphasized that the leak was not to the chorine tanks, therefore no gaseous chorine was released to the environment.  The l"
