This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.  Enterprise Products is currently in the process of implementing a full fourteen point safety management system at the recently acquired Aberdeen Propane Terminal.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane Terminal located in Moore County, North Carolina is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, LP. and is operated by Enterprise.\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane Terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility.  The facility receives odorized propane LPG by rail car and stores the liquid in one of eight, 30,000 gallon above ground pressurized storage tanks.   Propane vapor compressors are used to provide pressurized vapors into the vapor space for the unloading of rail cars spotted on the facility rail siding.  The same compressor is subsequently used to remove vapors from the empty cars prior to their disconnection from the tank fill piping and railcar unloading racks.  Odorized propane stored in the eight above-ground propane storage bullets is transferred to 18-wheel propane tanker trucks through the use of a small liquid propane pump.  The terminal operator is responsible for the hookup, unloading and disconnection of supply rail cars.  The operator also assists with the proper tare weighing,"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on the known volumes of the storage tanks and supply rail cars.  The only listed flammable substance which is stored above the threshold quantity at the Aberdeen Propane Terminal facility is odorized propane.  The propane terminal facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program being put in place at the Aberdeen Propane Terminal.  Enterprise has been able to locate only a minimal amount of records of the former owner\u00bfs safety management program, and is actively implementing its own standard safety management program at the facility as quickly as is practical. The storage and loading operations at the propane terminal facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system being put into place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation"

Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operator, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Only a minimal amount of process safety information is available at the site at this time.  Enterprise is developing a variety of technical documents that will be used to help maintain a safe ope"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The results of one previous process hazard analyses conducted by the previous owner are not available at the terminal.  Once sufficient safety information and accurate drawings are completed, Enterprise will conduct a thorough PHA revalidation review of the design of the Aberdeen Storage and Terminal facility.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the propane terminal facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.

Operating procedures available at the facility do not meet Enterprise standards for completeness.  The Enterprise Training Department is working with the terminal supervisor to prepare a new set of accurate and complete operating procedures.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Aberdeen Propane Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the facility.  New employees receive basic training in equipment and process flows, tank car unloading, and LPG truck loading operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the propane terminal facility has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform Propane terminal facility personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.

      "SummaryText": "pane terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to insure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane terminal has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.  Considering the design and operations that take place at the Aberdeen Propane Storage and Terminal facility, changes that require the use of the management of change program have been and are expected to occur infrequently.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Propane Terminal facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Aberdeen Propane terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Aberdeen Propane terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane terminal has safety features on the facility equipment to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n?\tVa"

Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane Terminal currently utilizes an emergency procedure which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in the emergency procedures, and they are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Propane Terminal facility.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n \n\nThe Aberdeen Propane Terminal is currently in the process of updating the written emergency response procedures.  Once prepared, the overall emergency procedure program will be coordinated with the Moore County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination will include periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Aberdeen Propane Terminal will institute any necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials similar to those already in pl"

In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Aberdeen Propane Terminal conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization.  The Aberdeen Propane Terminal facility also currently provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substances handled by the Propane terminal facility.\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane Terminal is in the process of updating the written emergency procedures to facilitate proper response to any emergency situations.  A copy of the procedures will be given to the Aberdeen Fire Department as part of periodic reviews of proper emergency response with local emergency responders.  The document will also be given to the Local Emergency Planning Committee for their review and use in overall community emergency planning.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Aberdeen Propane terminal facility resolves all findings from PHA\u00bfs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Changes are usually planned in response to PHA\u00bfs, safety audits and incident investigation findings.  The terminal is currently preparing the necessary safety information and drawings needed to conduct a thorough process hazard analysis of the terminal operations.   A Process Hazard Analysis revalidation is scheduled for mid-June of this year, and any recommendations to improve safety that are developed by the PHA Team will be evaluated by Area and Division management for implementation.
