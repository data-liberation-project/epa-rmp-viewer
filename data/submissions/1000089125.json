This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities. Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nCrestwood has a land and track lease agreement with the Carolina Coastal Railway (CLNA) for the short-term storage of up to 55 railcars containing propane near Nashville, NC.\n\n\n\nThe loaded interconnected railcars fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68 while disconnected from a means of transportation (i.e. locomotive). The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Propane.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Nashville Railcar Storage Facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 2 (RMP) regulation.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe storage of the regulated substance. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for safe storage of the propane and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained by operations. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). Crestwood safety information includes, written procedures and trained personnel, which provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities while the railcars are stored onsite. \n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nHazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Carolina Coastal Railway conducted a hazard assessment of the temporary railcar storage referenced above to ensure it is adequate and free from hazards associated with the storage of propane within railcars; for the intended duration.  Should potential hazards be identified, CLNA will systematically examine it and ensure that adequate controls are in place to mitigate the potential risk appropriately.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Carolina Coastal Railway follow the Federal Railroad Association written procedures that address deliveries and shipments for railcars. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for deliveries and shipments for railcars, the Carolina Coastal Railway has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nThe Carolina Coastal Railway has well-established practices an"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nCrestwood promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.

The ERP is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Crestwood and the Carolina Coastal Railway maintain active Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC) accounts to coordinate and assist first responders with the response protocol for transportation related HazMat emergencies. The emergency response program is updated when necessary. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program for the Nashville Railcar Storage Facility is coordinated with Nash County Emergency Management.
