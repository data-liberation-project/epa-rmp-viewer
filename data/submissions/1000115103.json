In case a chlorine leak is detected at the facility, the on-call Duty Operator is alerted via the SCADA system.  The Duty Operator alerts the Utilities Superintendent and/or Manager and/or Supervisor, and immediately responds to the alarm.  Upon arrival, the Duty Operator determines the severity of the incident and whether the Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team should be called to respond to the emergency.  The Duty Operator assignment is made on a rotating basis between the various trained and qualified Water Operations staff.  Each water operator has the necessary hazardous materials training to be considered qualified to assess the severity of a potential chlorine leak.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study (April 2024) and Seismic Assessment (May 2024) provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Carlsbad MWD Maerkle facility.  The PHA Study included a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the previous PHA study, a discussion of the facility\u0092s recent accident history, the completion of chlorine industry safety checklists, and the application of a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis that reviewed potential hazards and operational issues with the chlorine systems.  A Three-Year Compliance Audit was also conducted in June 2022 that identified compliance-related issues to ensure the District is maintaining full implementation of the PSM and RMP programs.\n\nThe Water Operations Department PSM Committee meets routinely (typically quarterly) to ensure that items recommended in studies such as PHAs, Compliance Audits, Seismic Assessments, and regulatory inspections are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nCarlsbad MWD also plans to improve safety as follows:\n\n  -- Continued involvement of water operati"

In the event of a chlorine leak, all personnel are directed to evacuate the facility.  Notifications of response agencies as well the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is also detailed the Emergency Response policy.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan contains procedures detailing how Carlsbad MWD Utilities department will react to chlorine releases and other emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, power outages, etc.  The facility\u0092s Emergency Action / Response Policy includes the following elements:\n\n  --  Key Facility Personnel and Responsibilities\n  --  Outside Agency Notification Contact Information\n  --  Detailed Action Plans for Internal Departments\n  --  First Aid Procedures\n  --  Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures\n  --  Evacuation Plans + Assembly Areas\n  --  Description for Handling Small Chlorine Leaks\n  --  Details of Outside Assistance Available\n  --  Incident Command System\n  --  Initial and Refresher Training\n\nThe Emergency Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "REVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Carlsbad MWD chlorine systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety design is inherent in the policies and procedures that are used to manage the operations of the chlorine processes.  For example, the Carlsbad MWD chlorine systems operate in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThe District maintains and implements a rigorous policy of inspections, testing, and maintenance for all chlorine components + auxiliary systems.  This comprehensive policy is based on both manufacturer recommendations, industry standards (ex: Chlorine Institute), and recognized generally accepted good engineering practices.  It includes regular routine visual inspection w/ a log sheet to record system parameters, replacement of components as recommended, overhaul / service on key parts such as vacuum regulators and rotameters, testing and calibration of chlorine leak detectors, testing of motor actuated automatic closing mechanisms and scrubbers, etc.\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are four mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine gas detectors, 2) visual/audible alarms, 3) chlorine scrubber system, and 4) halogen motorized automatic shut-off valves.\n\nThe chlorine detectors located in the chlorine rooms at both stations trigger local alarm annunciators, as well as notifying the Water Operators via the SCADA telemetry system.  The leak detection system also triggers the motorized automatic shut off valves to close the one-ton container valve (equipped with battery backup power), as well as activating the scrubber system that draws in any chlorine gas in the room to be neutralized.  The Scrubber for each facility has a capacity to neutralize 2,000 pounds of chlorine (one full ton container) with a 99%+ rate of effectiveness.\n\nA backup generator th"

The chlorine can be distributed to various points in the water system as needed based on water sampling results.  Each process feeds chlorine gas into solution at an injector where it is mixed with water, which neutralizes the hazards of the chlorine gas.\n\nThe chlorine systems are integrated into the District\u0092s SCADA system, which provides remote access to system parameters and operating conditions, as well as security monitoring.  The SCADA system provides a readout of the weight of the one-ton container that is on-line, status of facility access doors, and leak detection monitoring.\n\nThe one-ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Tank Room, which is protected by a scrubber with a capacity to neutralize up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas.  The scrubber is activated based on the alarm status of a chlorine leak detector located in the Chlorine Tank Room.  The scrubber system and auxiliary components (ex: air blower) are function tested on a monthly basis by water operators.\n\n** Upper Maerkle Station\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine maintained at the Upper Maerkle Station is 2 one-ton containers (4,000 pounds).\n\nThe design and operation of the chlorine system (upstream of the chlorinators) at the Upper Maerkle Station is very similar to that of the Lower Maerkle Station.  Only two rotameters are used at the Upper Maerkle Station.  Prior to injection, the chlorine gas passes through a chlorine dioxide generator that uses sodium hypochlorite as a reagent to create chlorine dioxide.  The process feeds this chlorine dioxide into solution at the injector where it is mixed with water.

Empty containers are also stored in the chlorine room until being picked up by the chlorine vendor during the next chemical delivery.\n\nTwo (2) one-ton containers are on-line at any one time where one is in operation and the other is on standby.  The on-line containers are each placed on a digital scale that indicates the remaining weight of chlorine in each of the on-line one-ton containers to allow system operators to monitor usage and plan ahead for ordering more chlorine.  The chlorine system is operated entirely under vacuum conditions with a vacuum regulator attached to each of the one-ton container valves.  Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The system connections are made at the upper container valve to ensure that chlorine gas (not liquid) is drawn out of the container.\n \nChlorine gas is drawn from the active one-ton container through an automatic switchover / vacuum regulator.  The automatic switchover regulator valves control which container is actively feeding chlorine to the system.  A vacuum (negative pressure) is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.
