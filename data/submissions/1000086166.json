Nor-Am has another cold storage location in Schuyler, Nebraska.  As stated on their website, Our facilities are centrally located in the midwest with easy access to highways and rail. We have the desire and the business experience to provide consistent excellent service to our customers.  Please review our capabilities and contact us.  You will find doing business with NOR-AM simple, pleasant and profitable.\r\n\r\nNor-Am's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe facility was built in three separate projects, referred to as phase one, two, and three.  The first phase was completed in March of 1999 which included two small compressors, one condenser, and eight coils in the freezer.  Through the summer of 1999 phase two was completed, which doubled the freezer space, added one large compressor, an additional condenser and four blast cells along with eight more freezer coils.  Late in 2000 and into 2001 phase three was added, which included an additional large compressor, eight freezer coils and a glycol heat exchanger.  The facility is located at 1555 21st Street SW, Le Mars, Iowa 51031.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 12,200 pounds of ammonia (as determined during a recent ammonia inventory calculation) as a refrigerant within a closed system. The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located in the machine room.  The condensers are mounted on the"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the Nor-Am Cold Storage operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\r\n\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: an ammonia sensor in the machine room and freezers that sound a facility-wide alarm and automatic shut down at 50 ppm, an emergency shut down button located outside of the engine room that kills power to the engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation in the machine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used at the facility.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidental or reportable ammonia releases at the Nor-Am facility in Le Mars, Iowa in the past five years (March 2015 - March 2020).  There have been no injuries due to the ammonia system.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nNor-Am Cold Storage has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives."

To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nNor-Am Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed on February 8, 2005 generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Nor-Am Cold Storage facility located at 1555 21st Street SW, Le Mars, Iowa 51031.  The Nor-Am Cold Storage safety committee has completed several items, including the recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\r\n\r\nA review or revision of the Process Hazard Analysis is being scheduled for 2010."
