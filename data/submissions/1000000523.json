All changes to covered processes are reviewed and signed off using the KFO MOC procedure.  Changes, when implemented, are done by qualified contactors and initial operation after change is preceded by a pre-startup safety review.   \n\nKFO has a series of Administrative Procedures (APs), Safe Work Practices (SWPs), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide detailed instructions for safely conducting operational and maintenance tasks and activities.  All of the above documents, in their latest version, are available to all employees electronically on the KFO Intranet.   \n\nAll incidents are reviewed by the senior staff and the employee Loss Control Action Committee.  Expanded accident investigations are conducted for significant events.  Emergencies are responded to using the Incident Command System with qualified and trained employees.  The KFO program is subject to external audits by a team of corporate auditors and findings are tracked to completion.\n",

KFO consists of three adjacent, but not contiguous, operating areas - the Kennewick Area, Hedges Area, and Finley Area.  The Hedges Area is currently on standby and all chemical inventories have been removed.  KFO facilities are located on the west bank of the Columbia River with open fields, industrial neighbors, and rural residences in the general area.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is brought into KFO by railcar and stored in atmospheric storage tanks, pressurized spheres, or cylindrical tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored for resale, transferred via pipeline for processing into nitric acid, and A?conversionA? into aqua ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is also mixed with nitric acid in a process called a neutralizer to produce an intermediate stream of 83% ammonium nitrate that is further processed into liquid fertilizer solutions.  Sales of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are typically in tanker truck load quantities picked up by wholesale vendors at the facilities.\n\n\n1.  KFO accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nKFO has management policy statements at the Corporate and plant management level endorsing the practice of all necessary measures to maintain safe operations.  Operating personnel are authorized to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to responds to an emergency.  KFO has an emergency response plan with detailed response procedures.\n\nKFO also has a series of Administrative Procedures (APs), Safe Work Practices (SWPs), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide detailed instructions for safely conducting operational and maintenance tasks and activities.  All of the above documents, in their latest version, are available to all employees electronically on the KFO Intranet.  Any procedure can be printed to be used as a guide for a specific task.\n\n\n2.  KFO regulated substanc"

The management structure based on the ICS is adaptable to incidents of any scope or magnitude.  The KFO emergency response management structure is designed to accommodate any type of incident.  The plantA?s designated emergency responders are trained to take emergency action in response to hazardous material incidents to stop, contain, and control releases.  If warranted, outside emergency services shall be called to provide assistance, and if needed, the services of an outside response contractor will be used.\n\nThe A?Spill & Release Reporting GuideA? outlines the reporting procedures in the event of a chemical release to the air, ground, ground waters, or to the Columbia River from KFO.  This guide is located on the KFO facility Intranet and is accessible by all KFO employees through any of the facilities computer station"
