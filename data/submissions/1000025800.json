      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR OXEA BAY CITY PLANT FACILITIES\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 2007, Celanese, Ltd. divested a portion of the Bay City Plant to OXEA, Corporation.  As a result of this divesture, ownership and operational control of several manufacturing units (acetate esters, butanol, propanol, utilities, SFA and POX) was transferred from Celanese to OXEA.  Celanese will remain the owner and operator of two units (Vinyl Acetate and Shipping Services) at the Bay City Plant.  As a result, Celanese and OXEA will be co-located facilities and have established contractual terms and conditions to ensure all critical safety and emergency response functions are maintained within the Bay City Complex.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nOXEA is committed to operating and maintaining all processes within the Complex in a safe and responsible manner.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to help ensure employee and public safety as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n\u00ad\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n\u00ad\tAn overview of accidental release prevention programs \r\n\u00ad\tA five-year accident history for releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's  RMP rule \r\n\u00ad\tAn overview of the emergency response program \r\n\u00ad\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment \r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Complex is situated in a rural area of Matagorda County several miles away from any residences.  The OXEA facility produces commodity organic chemicals, using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Some of these products include Butyl and Propyl Alco"

The following chemicals used in the process have been identified by the EPA has having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n \r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThere are no toxics that exceed the EPA RMP threshold quantity for the OXEA processes.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nPropylene (CAS No.115-7-1) is covered by the RMP rule.  It is a feedstock used in the Butanol process for the manufacture of butyl alcohol. Liquid propylene is supplied by pipeline.  About 16M lbs is contained in the piping within the plant fence boundary.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment through the use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following chemical-specific steps are taken to prevent accidental releases:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThere is propylene isolation system that automatically blocks in the propylene valve (SDV-9211) in the raw materials pipe rack along with the      Butanol Reaction system.\r\n\u00bf\tThere is also an emergency propylene isolation system can that can be remotely actuated in the control room by the operator.  \r\n\r\nThese safeguards work together with the process safety management programs to prevent accidental chemical releases.  OXEA and its employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that the requirements of the law and our own internal standards for accident prevention are met.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur.  During the past five years there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage"

The Plan includes responses for protection of employees, the environment, community and equipment resulting from hazardous releases of chemicals.  Essential planning and training needed to insure protection of workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations are fundamental to the Emergency Plan.  The Emergency Plan includes instructions for notifying the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) immediately when appropriate.  There are also emergency drills conducted by the site along with community first responders, sheriff's department and hospital.\r\n\r\nA computer based phone system is in place which can be used to notify residents about a release that could impact them, provide vital information on the event, and explain precautionary measures the residents should take. \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nImprovement in safety will continue to come from our hazard identification through the Process hazard Analysis (PHAs) that are conducted.  The previous Butanol PHA was performed in 2008. The next Butanol PHA Revalidation is planned for 2013.\r\n\r\nIn addition, OXEA will continue efforts to help prevent and improve response to accidental chemical releases.  These continued efforts include the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tUtilize employee hazard-recognition programs to help identify and address hazards within the site\r\n\u00bf\tConduct detailed Root-Cause Analysis on serious incidents and reliability issues to prevent a similar occurrence, and\r\n\u00bf\tContinue with the Safety Focus Team activities for the prevention of injuries and incidents."
