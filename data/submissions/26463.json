      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe R\u00dcTGERS Organics Corporation (ROC) State College, PA plant is a custom batch manufacturer of a variety of organic chemicals that are used in various industries such as agriculture, coatings and plastics.  The State College plant is located on a 39-acre site near State College, PA.  The original plant was built in 1958 and has expanded over the years.  The product mix at the facility changes frequently due to the nature of the custom batch manufacturing business.\n\nThe State College plant currently stores and uses three chemicals that are listed on the RMP Toxic Chemicals list above the material's threshold quantity.  These chemicals are 98% nitric acid (7697-37-2), chloroform (67-66-3) and 37% formaldehyde solution (50-00-0).\n\nThe 98% nitric acid is used in the manufacture of a herbicide intermediate.  The nitric acid is received via tank truck and is stored in a 7,500 gallon above ground; glass lined bulk storage tank.  The tank is located  within a 25' x 26' x 3' diked area.\n\nThe 37% formaldehyde solution is also used in the manufacture of a herbicide.  The formaldehyde is received via tank truck and is stored in a 8,000 gallon, above ground, insulated 316 stainless steel bulk storage tank.  The tank is located within a 26' x 38' x 9 diked area.\n\nThe chloroform is also used in the manufacture of a herbicide.  The chloroform is received via tank truck and is stored in a 5,700 gallon, above ground, 316 stainless steel bulk storage tank.  The tank is located within a 36' x 24' x 2' 4 diked area.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nROC's policy on accidental release prevention is to use multiple safeguards or layers of protection to minimize the likelihood of an accidental chemical release at is manufacturing facilities.  These layers of protection consist of safely designing, building or modifying facilities or equipment, training workers extensively, safely starting and restarting production operations, safely operating facilities and managing change"

      "SummaryText": ", regularly inspecting and maintaining equipment and regularly reviewing and auditing plant systems.\n\nThe first layer of protection consists of safely designing, modifying and building facilities or equipment.  Equipment design and installation are completed per established design and construction standards such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the National Fire Protection Association.  An initial process hazard analysis is conducted on the equipment design and operating procedures to help identify possible problem areas.  Safety systems are then designed into the manufacturing process to eliminate or at least minimize the possibility of worker exposure, fire or a chemical release.\n\nThe second layer of protection is training operators and contractors extensively.  New chemical operators complete a week of safety training before working in the plant.  Before a new process is started at the facility, operators are trained in proper operating procedures and process safety information.  The process training is updated every three years.  Training is reinforced by on the job training including evaluation by observation and demonstration.  Monthly safety training meetings are held to cover OSHA and EPA mandated topics.  Contractors also receive safety training before working at the State College facility.\n\nThe third layer of protection is safely starting and restarting plant operations.  A pre-startup safety review is completed before a new process is started and after a major modification is made to a process to ensure all necessary work has been completed prior to process startup.\n\nThe fourth level of protection is safely operating a production facility.  Detailed operating procedures are written for operators to follow and record necessary data and to detail safe operating limits for process parameters.  Fitness for duty is well defined through alcohol and substance abuse policies.  A management of change procedure is in place to control and evaluate"

Process hazard analyses are redone every five years for each production process.  Plant systems are routinely audited either by the ROC's Corporate EHS Department, regulatory agencies or customers.  Identified action items are documented and tracked to ensure they are addressed.  Any work-related injuries/illnesses, incidents, or near misses are documented and investigated to determine if corrective action is needed.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been no accidental releases involving any of the three RMP regulated substances, in excess of the material's respective reportable quantity, from the RMP covered production processes within the last five years.\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\nIn accordance with EPA's Risk Management regulation, the worst-case scenario estimated to result in the greatest distance to a specified toxic endpoint has been identified.  The worst-case case scenario consists of a release of ~44,000 (~3,500 gallons) of 98% nitric acid at 24o C (75o C) which is the entire contents of a tank truck.  The release is considered to occur as a result of the catastrophic failure (i.e., tank truck splitting open) of the tank truck.  This particular scenario considers the release to occur outside of any containment systems.  The release rate to outside air is 237 pounds (19 gallons)/minute.  Using worst case weather conditions as specified by EPA and Urban topography, the distance to nitric acid's toxic endpoint of 0.026 mg/L is 6.2 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in the RMP*Comp version 1.07 software program.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAn alternative release scenario has been developed for each of the RMP substances identified above.  The alternative release scenario for 98% nitric acid involves the release of 7,900 pounds (628 gallons) of 98% nitric"

The initial operational flow rate through this pipeline is 20 gallons/minute with an operational pressure of 20 psi.  The release duration is assumed to be 10 minutes with a release rate to outside air of 790 pounds (63 gallons)/minute.  The release occurs outside of containment.  Using alternative release case weather conditions as specified by EPA and Urban topography, the distance to nitric acid's toxic endpoint of 0.026 mg/L is 0.4 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in the RMP*Comp version 1.07 software program.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform involves the release of 68,200 pounds (5,487 gallons) of chloroform at 25o C (77o F) into a diked area resulting from the failure of a 2 pipe located at the bottom of a 5,700 gallon capacity bulk storage tank. A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the release rate to 64 pounds (5 gallons)/minute. Using alternative release case weather conditions as specified by EPA and Urban topography, the distance to chloroform's toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/L is 0.1 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in EPA's Risk Management Program - Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde involves the release of 72,000 pounds (8,000 gallons) of formaldehyde at 25o C (77o F) into a diked area from the failure of a 2 pipe located at the bottom of an 8,000 gallon capacity bulk storage tank. A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the release rate to 4.7 pounds (0.5 gallons)/minute.

This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in EPA's Risk Management Program - Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\nThe ROC State College plant has a comprehensive emergency response plan in place in the event that an accidental chemical release occurs.  The facility has a written emergency plan as required by various regulations.  The plant is equipped with an internal alarm system that is designed to notify plant employees in the event of a release.  The majority of the plant employees have been trained to the HAZMAT Technician level as defined by OSHA.  This training allows employees to actively stop releases and take aggressive actions to prevent spread of a release.  The initial training is reinforced by monthly training on various emergency response topics such as SCBA operation, personal protective equipment selection and use, spill cleanup and decontamination procedures.  \n\nPeriodically, the ROC State College plant participates in a county wide drill sponsored by the Centre County LEPC.  Other organizations that routinely participate in the drill include the local fire department, emergency medical services, Centre County Emergency Management Agency, Penn State University HAZMAT team, local police and the local hospital.  The drills are critiqued afterward to improve response activities.\n\n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nThe ROC State College plant is committed to continuous improvement of the safety of its operations in accordance with the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturer\u00bfs Organization\u00bfs Responsible Care codes.  Additionally, ROC's Corporate EHS Department has adopted the philosophy that each ROC plant develop, implement and mature its safety program to mirror the framework of the OSHA VPP STAR initiative and ISO 14000."
