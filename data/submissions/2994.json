The company manufactures a variety of specialty chemicals for the lubricants and coatings industries.  The company operates one facility for all manufacturing, research, marketing and administrative functions.  King Industries also operates a sales office in The Netherlands.  The company has operated in Norwalk since 1932.\n\nKing Industries uses a material called Oleum 20%.  Oleum 20% is the trade name for the mixture of 20% sulfur trioxide and 80% sulfuric acid.  The company has two storage tanks for Oleum that are capable of storing more than 10,000 lbs each.  This exceeds the reporting amount for Oleum (40 CFR Part 68.130).  Thus, King Industries is subject to Risk Management Plan Program 3 requirements (40 CFR 68.10).\n\nKing Industries takes a very proactive approach toward safety.  The company has several different programs to ensure the ongoing safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  The company has nine employees dedicated to working on safety and environmental issues, out of 165 total employees.  The company maintains a full-time fire brigade department.  The company has many written procedures for safely operating and maintaining plant equipment.  The company has an extensive training program for all its employees.  Operating procedure reviews, plant safety policy reviews, work procedure reviews, and any other training required by safety or environmental regulations are included in the company's training program.  The company uses state-of-the-art process and safety equipment throughout the facility.  The company has an ongoing inspection program for equipment, piping and vessels to help maintain reliability and prevent any incidents from occurring.\n\nKing Industries also has several programs for auditing and in"

The company conducts Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP) to review all possible scenarios that may result in a release of material; appropriate changes are made to prevent that release from ever happening.  If a release were to take place, the company maintains a thorough incident investigation program.  This investigation includes a cross-functional team of operators, maintenance personnel, engineers, and any other personnel who may be able to contribute to the investigation.
