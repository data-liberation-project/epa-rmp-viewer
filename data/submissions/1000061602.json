This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release. \n\n\n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation, guiding principles, and RAPTOR (Revealing At Risk Potentials Through Observing and Reporting) Program. Planned changes to improve safety are reviewed and adjusted annually. They are also included in the yearly budgets; and incorporated into the performance management systems/practice throughout the organization. These planned changes include, but are not limited to, safety related capital projects,\n\nsafety programs/initiatives, procedure improvements, and SOP validations.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny/Old Ocean consists of six covered processes linked by multiple pipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. Sweeny/Old Ocean also operates a terminal\n\nand storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The plant produces simple olefins, including ethylene and propylene, some C6 products, butadiene, and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL). These products are primarily intermediates which our\n\ncustomers"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration\n\ninformation. Specific departments within Sweeny/Old Ocean are assigned responsibility for maintaining upto-date Process Safety Information. Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as part of the written Employee Participation Plan to help employees locate any necessary Process Safety Information.Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, Sweeny/Old Ocean has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document. The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nSweeny/Old Ocean also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these\n\nhazards.\n\n\n\nSweeny/Old Ocean primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The team employs a Layer of Protection Analysis(LOPA) to assist with this task.\n\n\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team (using LOPA). This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features Sweeny/Old Ocean periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to\n\nreflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Sweeny/Old Ocean maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny/Old Ocean has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or\n\njob transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate\n\nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.

Contractors regularly participate in facility emergency drills.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nSweeny/Old Ocean conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the\n\nequipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make certain construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nSweeny/Old Ocean has a comprehensive system to manage change that utilizes both a written site procedure, PSM-1100 Management of Change and Pre-startup safety Review, as well as a company-wide software system. This software system aids in managing changes and provides a mean of controlling the change process through required safety and health evaluation, appropriate approval, and pre-startup safety review steps. This system requires that change to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSweeny/Old Ocean promptly investigates all incidents tha"
