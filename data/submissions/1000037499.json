              "Description": "Prevention Program Description:\n\n\n\nLP-Gas Cylinder Gas Production Plant has one 1,000 gallon Propane tank. These LP-Gas bulk storage tanks are equipped with relief valves on the top, and the usual tank pressure is 200 psig. Propane bulk tanks are owned and filled by AmeriGas Propane.  The bulk tank is piped into a CORKEN model ?1114100101? pump that will deliver 10-12 gallons of Propane per minute. The pump is equipped with relief valves to prevent pump over-pressure as well.  The LP-Gas lines (Propane, Propylene, and Starflame C) leading to the filling station has a line pressure of 200-300 psig and a delivery capacity of 10-12 GPM.  In the LP-Gas filling station, LPG cylinders are filled by weight on a scale. Overfilling of cylinders must be carefully avoided, as LP-Gas may expand in warmer temperatures and cause dangerous situations of over-pressure.  Two fire extinguishers are assigned near the LP-Gas filling station.\n\n\n\n    The Risk Management Program for LP-Gas process is to minimize the possibility of unwanted release of LP-Gas, thereby decreasing fire hazard to employees and offsite populace.  In Process Safety Information, overview of the process pertaining to safety is provided, along with process flow diagrams.  Process parameters and equipment specifications in the process are also provided.  In Process Hazard Analysis, different scenarios of unwanted release of LP-Gas are documented and studied; recommendations are provided to strengthen existing safeguards.  Operating Procedures provide standard operational procedures on LP-Gas filling process.  In Training section, employee training materials for overall LP-Gas process, safety, and operations are included, along with written quizzes to gauge competence.  Mechanical Integrity provides maintenance schedules and inspections tests for the LP-Gas process equipments; maintenance procedures and documentations are also included.  Through Mechanical Integrity, ongoing equipment maintenance is implemented on regular schedules, instead of providing maintenance at equipment break-downs.  Management of Change provides ways in which changes to the process could be studied, approved, tracked, and documented.  Employee input into the prevention program can also be done through Employee Participation, in which employees can contribute to the development of the prevention program, the operational procedures, and etc.  The Incident Investigation section provides systems in which incidents or ?near-misses? are investigated.  In Hot Work section, the approval procedures are laid out for work with fire risk, along with Hot Work permit approval checklists.  This way the feasibility of hot work can be studied and approved through the system established by Hot Work.  In the Contractor section of the program, procedures for approving and training contractors are established, along with the Contractor Compliance Agreement forms.  The Risk Management Prevent Program is audited by an in house auditor every three years to evaluate the compliance and implementation of the program.  The auditor evaluations will be thoroughly studied and addressed.\n\n",

At the nexAir Gas Cylinder Filling Plant in Norcross, Ga; Propane Cylinder Filling is the only flammable process covered under Risk Management Regulations.  nexAir production plant has had excellent record in operational safety, and we will continue this serious commitment towards the safety and well-beings of ourselves and the public.  Worst Case and Alternative Release Case scenarios involving LP-Gas (Propane) were studied.  Impact end point radii were calculated, and the residence populations within the impact radii were documented.   Level 3 Prevention Programs were developed for the Propane production processes.  The Prevention Programs were aimed at minimizing the possibility of flammability hazards during unwanted release.  Included in the prevention programs are process training, equipment maintenance, possible release scenarios, standard operating procedures, incident investigation systems, etc.  We at nexAir have every confidence that the comprehensiveness and effective implementation of the prevention programs can seriously contribute to the safety and efficiency of our processes."
