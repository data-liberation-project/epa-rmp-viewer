      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe NPX One (formerly Cryovac) Food Packaging manufacturing Plant at Indianapolis has implemented an accidental release prevention policy, which integrates containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices. All Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to. The NPX One Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans, which are detailed in the Emergency Operations Manual (EOM). This includes a trained on-site, around the clock Emergency Response Team, and procedures to notify the local fire authority.\n\n 2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\nThe NPX One (formerly Cryovac) Food Packaging facility manufactures plastic foam packaging used in the food industry. The plant uses pentane and isobutane as blowing agents to make plastic foam. These are the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location. Pentane (CAS 109-66-0) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline and isobutane (CAS 75-28-5) is a colorless, odorless flammable gas. Pentane is used and stored as a liquid in two un-pressurized USTs. Isobutane is no longer used and but stored in a single pressurized AST. The blowing agents are introduced into plastic extrusions and released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\n\n3. THE WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nThe \"worst-case release\" scenario as defined by EPA assumes that both storage tanks completely fail, all 137,000 pounds of contents release to secondary containment, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditions exist, the vapors find an ignition source and 10% of release explodes as a vapor cloud. The endpoint is at 1 psi overpressure is 0.08 miles according to EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp model.\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario or more credible scenario is based on an analysis of potential hazar"

      "SummaryText": "ds at our facility. Maximum release is estimated at 250 pounds per minute from a breach of a delivery tanker truck or failure of the delivery piping. The impact distance is based on maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences, 0.05 miles or in most cases, within our property lines. The impact distance in both cases has been derived using the EPA \"RMP*Comp\u0094 Offsite Consequence Analysis model. The above analysis is based on a pentane release, Pentane is the only listed chemical stored at the facility in excess of the 10,000 pound highly flammable substance threshold. \nLess than 8,000 pounds of Isobutane is currently stored onsite and it is no longer used in the manufacturing process, but because isobutane is a flammable gas, it actually has the potential to create a larger radius vapor cloud explosion incident than the pentane. The worst-case scenario vapor cloud explosion incident for a 7,900 pound isobutane release is 0.2 miles, while the alternative case, involving a more likely 75 pound per minute leak and subsequent vapor cloud explosion, has a distance to endpoint of <0.1 miles according to RMP*Comp. Both chemicals involve flammability risks. \n\n4. THE GENERAL CRYOVAC ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n* E.A.T. Training of operators\n* PSM process- completed HAZOP review of all stages of process\n* Spill containment and 30,000 gallons capture vault for unloading areas\n* Monitored double wall tanks and piping for pentane\n* Hydrocarbon sensor safety interlock system\n* Highly detailed check off sheets for any tank filling with radio monitoring\n* Redundant alarms for potential upset conditions\n* Preventative maintenance program\n* Check-off sheet procedures for non-routine activities such as line breaking or draining of Tanks or piping.\n* Use NFPA guidelines as a minimum standard for all fire protection systems.\nChemical - specific prevention steps include having dete"

FIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORIES:\nThere have been three accidental releases in the five years prior to the 2015, all of which involved releases of less than one gallon. There were no injuries, property damage or offsite consequences as a result of these incidents. In place systems resulted in early detection and mitigation.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe Emergency Response program incorporates an on-site Emergency Response Team fully trained and equipped for incipient fire fighting, awareness level hazmat response, confined space rescue, and first responder first aid. Pre-plans, joint training and drills are coordinated with Pike Township Fire Department who is responsible to Marion County Hazardous Materials Planning Committee (LEPC) on a county wide mutual response. Emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed on an annual basis.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nA number of changes to improve safety and reduce risks have been implemented that were identified in the HAZOP review of PSM in 2021. Safety is an ongoing process and the highest priority at NPX ONE facilities. The monthly Management Safety Committee meeting provides safety items are first on the agenda of the daily production meeting and overall direction, control, and follow up."
