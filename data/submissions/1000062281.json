FHR's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n2.1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Longview facility, operated by FHR, is a propylene unloading and storage facility located in Longview, Texas. The facility is operated for offloading propylene from railcars into a storage tank until transferred via pipeline to a nearby polymers plant. \n\n\n\nAs part of its unloading and storage operations, the facility uses propylene, an EPA RMP covered chemical, in quantities greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The facility consists of three double-sided railcar unloading racks for a total of six offloading spots, in addition to a storage tank, compressor system, and associated piping and instrumentation. Railcars are offloaded into the storage tank, and propylene is transferred via pump from the storage tank into a Department of Transportation (DOT) pipeline that transfers propylene to a nearby Polymers plant. The Longview facility does not have any EPA RMP-regulated toxic chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Manageme"

These standards include:\n\n\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets such that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting findings identified in regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\nFHR is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. The Longview facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment. However, if a release does occur, trained FHR personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident. Details on the emergency response program are outlined in Section 2.1.6.\n\n\n\n2.1.4    Prevention Program\n\nThe FHR Longview Facility is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has contributed to process safety.  The facility has had no RMP chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical r"
