This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Seneca County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nEvans Chemetics was formed in Waterloo during the early 1940s to manufacture divalent sulfur compounds for the hair care and cosmetic industries.  Since that time, the number of products has grown to over 30, serving the cosmetic, plastics, and specialty chemical industries.  The products manufactured are sold to other manufactures as raw materials and ingredients in their final products.\r\n\r\nIn our processes, Evans Chemetics uses two regulated substances, acrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile] and epichlorohydrin [oxirane, (chloromethyl)-].  Acrylonitrile is used as a raw material to manufacture a variety of products, including secondary antioxidants for plastics and rubber and polymerization chain transfer agents.  Epichlorohydrin is also used as a raw material to manufacture products used in the photographic, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.  Both chemicals are received by tank truck, and unloaded into nitrogen blanketed and vapor balanced bulk storage tanks.  Transfers from the bulk storage tanks to the site reactors are done in closed piping to eliminate employee and community exposure.  The reactions are also carried out in"

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  Our Title V air permit was changed to a State only air permit in May 2008.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEvans Chemetics maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Process safety information includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specification sheets and maintenance manuals, reactive chemical data, and materials of construction information.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The primary hazard analysis methodology is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nWritten operating procedures are maintained on all the chemical processes operated at the facility.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEvans Chemetics has a comprehen"

Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nEvans Chemetics carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Evans Chemetics to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Evans Chemetics.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nEvans Chemetics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEvans Chemetics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catas"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEvans Chemetics truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Evans Chemetics has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and are required to inform Evans Chemetics of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nEvans Chemetics has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of acrylonitrile or epichlorohydrin during this period as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nAll plant personnel are trained to recognize and initially respond to any release of chemicals.  Approximately 40% of the employees are trained at the 24 or 40 hour HAZWOPER level, and have the equipment and capability to properly respond to any chemical release.  In addition to Evans Chemetics' own emergency response capability, emergency planning and response is coordinated with the Seneca County LEPC (Local Emergency Respons"

During the last 5 years we implemented the following risk reduction or prevention activities:\r\n\r\n1)A firefighting and foam suppression system was added to the acrylonitrile and epichlorohydrin bulk storage tanks and dikes to both extinguish any fire in the bulk tank dikes, and to suppress vapors from any spills or leaks.\r\n\r\n2)A process reactor catch tank system was added to divert any process release through the various reactor relief systems into a catch tank to contain the release on-site, and not impact the community.\r\n\r\n3)Numerous process safety improvements are being made, including:\r\n\r\n - Converted a batch reaction into a semi-continuous reaction where the covered material is added to the reactor over a few hours under highly controlled conditions versus adding all the reactant at once at the beginning of the batch.\r\n -  Added containment trenches at two tank truck unloading areas to contain leaks and spills at the unloading location versus using the general site containment berm\r\n - Added a number of process controls and interlocks\r\n\t\r\n4)Improved the emergency response team by adding additional employees to cover all the shifts\r\n \r\nAs additional risk reduction opportunities are identified, they will be added to the above list.\r\n\r\nThe plan for 2013 and 2014 is to further increase employee involvement and to improve the employee training and development program.  Chemical operators will receive advanced training on both the chemistry / unit operations of the processes they operate, and on the potential hazards to bring them as close as possible to the skills of the engineering group overseeing the site operations.
