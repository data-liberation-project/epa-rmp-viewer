The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in each system is summarized below:\r\n\r\nHigh Pressure Receivers\r\nThe purpose of each high pressure receiver is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration systems. Each high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and liquid recirculators. Each high pressure receiver is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in each process at any given moment. Each high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout each system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlooded Accumulators\r\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the low pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nIntercoolers\r\nThe purpose of each intercooler is to desuperheat a"

Each intercooler also receives and subcools liquid from the high pressure receivers in order to supply lower pressure liquid to the flooded accumulators and liquid recirculators. Ammonia vapor is piped from the top of each intercooler into the suction inlet of each high stage compressor. Each intercooler is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the intercoolers contain low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nSubcooler\r\nThe subcooler receives and subcools liquid from the high pressure receiver in order to supply subcooled liquid to the liquid recirculator. The subcooler is a heat exchanger that uses a supply of low temperature ammonia to cool high pressure liquid ammonia. On the low temperature side, the subcooler is equipped with an expansion valve which expands high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the heat exchanger. On the high pressure side, high pressure liquid is piped from the high pressure receiver and into spiral piping inside the subcooler. The low pressure liquid in the vessel absorbs heat from the high pressure liquid in the spiral piping. The subcooled high pressure liquid exits the subcooler and is supplied to the liquid recirculator. Under normal conditions, the subcooler contains low and high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLow Temperature Recirculators\r\nThe purpose of each low temperature recirculator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in low temperature evaporators throughout the facility.

Under normal conditions, the low temperature recirculators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nOil Pots\r\nThe purpose of the oil pots is to provide a safe location to drain oil from each refrigeration system. The oil pots receive liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculators, intercoolers, or low pressure receiver and vent ammonia vapor back to each associated vessel. The oil pots are equipped with spring-return oil drain valves which are used to drain oil from the systems as needed. Under normal conditions, the oil pots contain low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel.

The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the high pressure receivers. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator.

The shell and tube heat exchanger receives liquid from a flooded accumulator where it is contained within the shell of the heat exchanger and surrounds the tubes containing secondary coolant. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the shell and tube heat exchanger and is returned to the flooded accumulator. Under normal conditions, the shell and tube heat exchanger contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLow Pressure Receiver\r\nThe purpose of the low pressure receiver is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The low pressure receiver receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and recirculators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the low pressure receiver drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The low pressure receiver is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the low pressure receiver contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the low pressure receiver.

The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the low pressure receiver, intercooler, or recirculator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAuto-Purgers\r\nThe purpose of each auto-purger is to remove non-condensable gases from each system without requiring the system to be manually opened. Each auto-purger consists of the following components: water bubbler, foul gas line, liquid line, suction line, water line, drain line, and remote purge point solenoid valves. Each auto-purger removes non-condensable gases by refrigerating the foul gas so that the ammonia vapor condenses to liquid and can be returned to the system. The non-condensable gases are removed from each system through the water bubbler. Under normal conditions, the aut"
