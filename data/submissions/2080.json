This is an extensive response program that was developed by the County of Monroe, Monroe County Health Department, Office of Civil Preparedness, Monroe County LEPC, Wastewater Department, Fire Department, Police Department, Department of Public Services and other organizations.  \n\nOff-Site Response Program establishes polices and procedures for the following: \n\nPurpose, Concept of Operation; Hazard Description/Vulnerability; Emergency Response; Community Organization; Tasks and Education of duties during a release; Hazard Description/Population Vulnerability; Emergency Response Procedures; Incident Classification; Procedures for Notifications/Warnings; Hazmat Incident Notification Form; Procedures for Central Dispatch; Procedures for Direction and Control during an event; Worst Case Plume Analysis; Location of EOC/Command Post; Assessment Procedures; Protective Actions; Time Estimates for Response; Health and Emergency Medical Procedures/Response; Registration of Emergency Shelters; Emergency Public Information; Containment/Clean-Up Procedures; Pre-Incident Training; Risk Area Assessment including; Risk Area Boundary; Evacuation Routes; and Access Control Warnings.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention:\n\nThe facility has developed an extensive process safety management program in compliance with OSHA 1910.119.  This program is designed to utilize a team  approach to minimize the potential for release of chlorine gas at the facility.  A safety review team has been established to review the program on a yearly basis and"

The process safety management program is roughly 500 pages and includes sections on employee review and input, committee recommendations, process safety information, written process, facility planning, employee involvement, safety committee, accidental release investigation, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures and Practices, Employee Training, Mechanical Integrity, Quality Assurance, Pollution Incident Prevention Plan, Process diagrams and Relative Information on Chlorine, Written Emergency Chlorine Response Program including MSDS Information, The Chlorine Institute Manual, Information on the Emergency Repair kit \"B\", and the Wastewater Department Chlorine Safety Program.\n\n\n\nFuture Improvements:\n\nOne million three hundred thousand dollars has been budgeted for a Capital Improvements project that will install ultra violet disinfection so that chlorine gas will not be used at the facility.  The Design/build is estimated to take two years, therefore, the anticipated start-up date is July 2001.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe Monroe Wastewater Facility is located at 2205 E. Front Street, in the City of Monroe, Michigan.  The wastewater facility is located in an industrial section of town isolated from  residential areas. The facility processes 12.5 million gallons of wastewater from the community each day.  Once the Wastewater is treated and the pollutants are removed, the effluent is chlorinated to kill pathogenic microorganisms.  To effect this, disinfection chlorine is used.  Up to a maximum of six ton cylinders can be stored in the chlorine storage area at a time.  Usually, there are three or four full one-ton cylinders at the facility.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario, Tank Rupture:\n\nTon chlorine cylinders are regulated by MDOT and are constructed to be transported over our highway system.  Despite the fact that a tank rupture would be hi"

Chlorine alarms are present and tested daily with personnel receiving yearly training on all aspects of the process.  The more likely scenario, is a line rupture or gasket leak.  Containment is provided within the chlorine room.  Operators are trained in the use of \"B\" kit and SCBA utilization to effect an expedient repair. The Fire department is our local responder and their training is substantial in hazardous response.     Depending on the type of release, the response actions that will take place and are governed by our off-site response Standard Operating Procedure.  \n\nThe entire chlorination feed system has been evaluated.  The evaluation resulted in reducing the amount of chlorine cylinders from a potential of  twenty-four to a maximum of six cylinders at any one time.  Further improvements have been made to the storage area, monitoring and sodium bisulfate is available as a neutralization source.  A new sodium bisulfate system has been installed in the storage area.\n\nPlans are further underway to install ultraviolet disinfection and discontinue the use of chlorine gas.  This SYSTEM SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL by July 2001.  \n\n Passive Mitigation Includes:\nKeeping all doors and ventilator system shutoff until repairs are made.  This will contain a majority of the release so that active mitigation can be affective.\nFeed system review and upgrading.\nAlarm system for early response. \nPlant to replace the chlorine within a two-year period.\nActive Mitigation - to contain and absorb/neutralize released chlorine by using sodium Bisulfate.  Bisulfate should absorb approximately 50% to 75% of the escaped gas.\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program that the Monroe Facility complies with is: \n\nThe Process Safety Management PSM 1910.119.\n\nThe Five Year Accident History: \n\nThere has not been a reportable release of chlorine from the Monro"
