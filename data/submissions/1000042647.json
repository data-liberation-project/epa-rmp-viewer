This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the State of Missouri.  Our emergency response policy involves the  preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with the capacity of 18,000 gallons water capacity.  One storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equiipment are all part of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  This facility  operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall seasons.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer house failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 85,000 pounds if anhydrous ammonia.  The off site consequences were calculated using \"TFI RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\".  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with a \"F\" atmospheric stabilty class. A rural topography was selected as typical.\n\nThe\"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose and leaks 7,200 p"

The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmosperic stabilty class was used in this scenario.\n\nFarmers Cooperative Services, Inc  has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years. Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinate annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nFarmers Cooperative Service, Inc has several key elements in their accident prevention plan.\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulation of the State of Missouri.\n2. Training is required of  all new personnel who are handling, transferring,or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequest site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
