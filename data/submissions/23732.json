      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of ZIELKE FARM SERVICE, INC. to prevent accidental realease of anhydrous ammonia by maintaining  the equipment and training employess in the proper prodecures in the storage and handling of the material which we supply farmers.  In the case of an emergency we would rely on our hazmat staff and the Anwerp Fire Department which we have had on site training with the members of the department in the large storage tanks and the mobile tanks used by farmers.  The stationary source storage tank which when full contain approximately 81,549  pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The worst-case scenario would be a total loss of the contents of the tank.  The altermative release scenario would be a loss occuring when a transfer hose fails.  There are no administrative controls which can limit the distance of the potential material release.  The mitigation measures that limit the distance to the potential material release are excess flow valves.  The general accidentalrelease prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are to adhere to the normal operation procedures for using anhydrousa ammonia fertilizer tank.  The five-year accident history is void of any releases from the storage tanks.  The emergency response program is case of an ammonia leaks is as follows:  1) Evacuate all non-essential personal to main office building.  2) Determine size of the leak, if less than 100 pounds use proper Personal Protecive equipment with water curtain to stop flow of gas, if possible. If more than 100 poundswe will call 911for additional help and follow emergency plan for large storage leaks or releases of product. Will  notifiy Local EMA director who has knowledge of our operation and the procedures and evacuation plans of the local area and steps which need to be followed.  We feel we have a very good plan on how to hand any emergency which may happen at our fertilizer operation."
