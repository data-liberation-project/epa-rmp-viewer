              "Description": "Process Hazard AnalysisOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the what if/checklist, fault tree analysis, and the failure mode and effects analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years or sooner if there are process or equipment changes.  Any findings related to the hazard ananysis are handled in a timely manner.  For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, East Moline Wastewater maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emerency operations,normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  East Moline has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these procesess.  New employees are given hands on classroom instruction followed up by on the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years or less, as needed.  East Moline Wastewater carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. Written procedures are in place that cover areas such as management of change.  Changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Employees affected by such modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.  Pre-startup related to new processes or modifications to processes are reviewed.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance precedures are suitable for safe startup prior to use.  Compliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure provisions set out under RMP are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any findings of corrective measures are undertaken in a timely manner.  East Moline Wastewater promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actins to prevent the relese from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.  East Moine Wastewater truly believes that process safety managment and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.  On occasion, we have hired or used vendors for specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   East Moline Wastewater has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  East Moline Wastewater has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.  The local agency coordinating ER Plan is Rock Island Emergency & Disaster which has the phone number 309-799-5166.  The City has recently started a safety team citywide.  It is committed to ensure that all facets of the safety program and accident prevention are being implemented and updated.",
