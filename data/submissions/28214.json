Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Helena Chemical Co. in Brunswick are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We coordinate our response\r\nefforts with the Brunswick Fire Department, which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Brusnwick (Figure 1).  The maximum\r\namount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.  With the\r\ninclusion of our facility nurse tanks, we have a total storage capacity of 308,760 pounds of anhydrous\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp which utilizes the EPA OCA Guidance for the worst case and alternate case\r\nscenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these\r\nscenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\r\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\r\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\r\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.6 miles (Figure 2).  The estimat"

The\r\nscenario involves the release of 6,854.78 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\r\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\r\nmg/L of ammonia is 1.0 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 1.0-mile radius of the\r\nfacility is 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nHelena Chemical Co. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\r\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nHelena Chemical Co. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\r\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\r\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\r\n(Appendix B).\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nHelena Chemical Co. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\r\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nHelena Chemical Co. conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\r\nproper operation.

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\r\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\r\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\r\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Helena Chemical Co. to manage changes in process chemicals,\r\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\r\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\r\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nHelena Chemical Co. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\r\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\r\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\r\nequipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nHelena Chemical Co. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\r\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue\r\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nHelena Chemical Co. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a\r\nteam effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\r\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\r\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information\r\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n  5.

Emergency Response Plan\r\nHelena Chemical Co. maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of\r\nhazardous materials which is coordinated with the local fire department and the LEPC.  The plan is\r\nintended to assist responding agencies to address all aspects of emergency response including first\r\naid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and\r\nthe public.  In the event of an accidental release, Helena Chemical Co. will contact the local\r\nemergency response agencies (Appendix A).\r\n\r\n7.  Planned Safety Changes\r\n\r\nWe plan to continually upgrade the NH3 system at our site to stay in compliance with State and\r\nFederal regulations.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to\r\nensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and\r\nprovide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
