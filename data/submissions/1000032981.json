The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to six (6) cold storage rooms, three (3) precool rooms, a hallway, and various pieces of processing equipment. The rooms use a combination of bunker style coils and ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia. The processing equipment includes a hydrocooler and a plate-and-frame glycol chiller. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \r\n\r\nMost of the facility is a pumped liquid recirculator system where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to a liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils. Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to three reciprocating and one screw compressor which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.
