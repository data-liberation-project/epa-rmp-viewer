      "SummaryText": "Aberdeen Energy, LLC (AE) is an ethanol fuel production plant located near the city of Mina, in Edmunds County, South Dakota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112 Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, AE completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that exceed reporting thresholds. AE is a new facility that will begin operations in early June 2008.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAE is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. AE uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  AE uses anhydrous ammonia for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of AE to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of AE to notify the Aberdeen Police & Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a co-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of natural gasoline, or denaturant, which may contain approximately 25 percent n-pentane, 28 percent isopentane, and 3 percent n-butane, all RMP regulated substances. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 1,030,000 pounds (total n-pentane approximately 260,000 pounds, isopentane 290,000 lbs, and n-butane 31,000 lbs). The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol product"

AE has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. AE has coordinated emergency response with local authorities and responding agencies and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, AE has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis (PHA) , training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.   A prliminary PHA for the ammonia and flammables process was conducted prior to start up and no significant modiifcations to the processes were required as a result.  Audits of the overall RMP and Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAberdeen Energy, LLC is a new facility and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering."
