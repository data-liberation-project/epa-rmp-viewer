To comply with the requirements in 40 CFR 68\n\nChemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF BOWIE (City)\n\ndeveloped a Risk Management Program (RMProgram) for the BWTP including\n\nManagement System, Hazard Assessment, Accidental Release Prevention\n\nProgram (ARPP), and Emergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to\n\nreduce the employee and public risk of injury, death, or damage from\n\naccidental release of chemicals.\n\n\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe City has the overall responsibility for implementing and\n\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\n\nwith the Management System, the City Manager is designated as the\n\nRMProgram Director, and the Water Plant Superintendent is the\n\nRMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are assigned\n\nresponsibility for implementing each individual requirement set forth\n\nin the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or Emergency Response\n\nPlan.  The RMProgram participants include the following positions:\n\n\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\n\nB.   RMProgram Manager\n\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\n\nD.   Safety Information Officer\n\nE.   Hazard Review Update Officer\n\nF.   Operations Manager\n\nG.   Training Supervisor\n\nH.   Maintenance Supervisor\n\nI.   Compliance Audit Officer\n\nJ.   Incident Investigation Officer\n\nK.   Emergency Planning and Response Officer\n\nL.   RMPlan Update Officer\n\n\n\nManagement systems and responsibilities are described in detail in\n\nthe Accidental Release Prevention Program, to ensure every participant\n\nplaying a role in the RMProgram understands their responsibilities.\n\n\n\n2    REGULATED CHEMICALS AND PROCESSES\n\n\n\nRegulated toxic chemicals and processes at the BWTP consist of\n\nstorage, transfer, and use of chlorine in the chlorination system.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in five (5) side-by-side\n\ncontainers located indoors.

Offsite\n\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\n\nprinciple elements:\n\n\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters used for the dispersion modeling analysis\n\n     were the standards recommended by USEPA and incorporated in the \n\n     RMP*Comp program. \n\n     \n\nB.

The main purpose of the manual is to provide operation and maintenance personnel detailed standard procedures to reduce employee and public risk to injury, death, or property damage from accidental chemical releases.  The manual includes the following elements and complies with requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\n\n\nA.   Management\n\nB.   Safety Information\n\nC.

Historical, current and future significant efforts focus on the following areas:\n\n\n\nA.   Development of a safety information database essential for the\n\n     successful implementation of other procedures, including\n\n     operation, maintenance, training, compliance audits, incident\n\n     investigation, and emergency plannin"

Plant employees are limited to responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance procedures.  Appropriate procedures were initially developed will be updated.  Procedures provide instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak is considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local emergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Procedures were developed to meet regulatory requirements, such as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation, availability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at the BWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is the Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Bowie Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding regulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management Office who has developed and implemented emergency response plans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in emergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated processes.  Although it will not be the responsibility of the plant employees to evacuate offsite areas, addresses and telephone numbers of major public receptors inside a one- (1) mile radius are provided in the plan.  BWTP personnel will work closely with the Emergency Management Office and document coordination activities and communications.\n\n\n\n7    ON-GOING AND UP-COMING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nThere are currently no process modifications or facility upgrade projects ongoing or scheduled that would improve the safety of regulated facilities a"
