      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe City of Inver Grove Heights Minnesota has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Water Treatment Facility. The purpose of this Plan is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine gas for both employees of the Facility and also the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n1. FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe City of Inver Grove Heights Water Treatment Plant treats an average of 3 million gallons of water per day. The Facility uses approximately 30 pounds per day of chlorine for disinfection. During normal operations, the Facility may have up to 4,000 pounds of chlorine stored at the site. The chlorine cylinders are stored in 2,000 pound containers in a TGO Technologies Dual Chlortainer Containment System.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is required to create a Risk Management Plan for chlorine in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency Regulation 40 CFR 68. Creation of the RMP also provides compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirement in OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. A Facility follows this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in a water treatment process.  Inver Grove Heights maintains more than the threshold quantity, 2,500 pounds, of chlorine on-site at any given time. An original RMP was created and submitted to the EPA in June of 1999. This edition represents the required five-year update of that earlier Plan.\n\n\n\n2. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Water Treatment Plant was operational starting in July of 1998.  The system incorporates modern technology to safely handle and feed chlorine into the City's water system.\n\n\n\nThe feed system operates on a vacuum principle with automatic shut off valves if the vacuum is interrupted.  This minimizes the risk of a major release due to damage to the chlorine piping system.  In case of a major leak, the two one ton containers are enclosed in a dual Chlortainer containment system manufactured by TGO Technologies.  This "

      "SummaryText": "is the primary line of defense in protecting the surrounding community against the hazards associated with a major chlorine release.  All release scenarios used in this plan do not take into account any scrubber operation or other mitigation.  The scrubber is not included in the scenarios in order to calculate the worst case circumstances.    \n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Water Treatment Facility also is equipped with an emergency back-up generator.  This generator is capable of running the entire plant in the event of a power outage.\n\n\n\n3. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Water Treatment Facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  Emergency response would only be used in the rare occurrence that there is a major release.  In the event of a major chlorine release, an employee of the plant would be responsible for calling the Inver Grove Heights Fire Department.  The Fire Department would then assess if a HAZMAT team is needed.  These organizations are trained in handling emergency situations and hazardous materials.  These agencies would be responsible for mitigating the effects of the chlorine release and coordinating evacuation procedures if necessary.\n\n\n\nA training program has been established to ensure that all employees of the treatment facility can identify an emergency situation and understand the procedure for notifying the proper employees.  As part of this program, facility employees will also meet with representatives of the fire department to discuss and review the treatment plant and its emergency response.\n\n\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RMP/PSM PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP/PSM regulations to help minimize the risk of a chlorine release. The updated RMP/PSM Manual outlines training requirements, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and defines responsible persons for implementing the aspects of the Plan. The RMP/PSM Plan will continue to provide guidance "

This Program Manager shall be responsible for delegating responsibility for specific elements and also ensuring that the entire RMP is being implemented.\n\n\n\n5.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Water Treatment Facility operates with safety as its highest priority. Upgrades are being made to the facility SCADA system audible alarm. These modifications add redundancy to the leak detection alarm, ensuring the early warning of any individual in the vicinity. These redundancies to the alarm system act in complement to process controls that drastically reduce the chance of a release. "
