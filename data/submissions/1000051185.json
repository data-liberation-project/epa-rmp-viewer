      "SummaryText": "Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC operates a poultry processing plant in Hattiesburg, Mississippi located at 1301 James Street.  Our processing plant produces wholesome, safe, USDA inspected poultry for human consumption.  This process requires that the poultry be processed and stored at low temperatures to prevent spoilage.   Our refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant to achieve the low processing and storage temperatures.  \n\n\n\nOur facility's refrigeration system is calculated to contain approximately 30,450 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC complies with the applicable OSHA regulation and the Process Safety Management Regulation.  Refrigeration equipment is maintained and inspected daily by our in-house refrigeration technicians to ensure that the system is operating safely.  We also use periodic third party inspections by qualified inspectors to ensure the system is operating safely.\n\n\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident or release in the last 5 years in the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nIn case of a major release, plant management will coordinate with the Hazardous Material Team of the Hattiesburg Fire Department in a combined response to the accident.  This response would include public notification and evacuation of the surrounding areas, if necessary.  Plant personnel are regularly trained and drilled on emergency response procedures.  The facility works with the Hattiesburg Fire Department to ensure familiarity with our processes.\n\n"
