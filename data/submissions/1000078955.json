The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (Point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The Aamerican National Standards Institute, Inc., and\n\nthe standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \n\n\"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.
