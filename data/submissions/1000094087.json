WTG will meet all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nJameson Gas Plant (\"Jameson\"), located in Silver, Coke County, Texas, is a natural gas treating, processing and fractionation plant.  Inlet gas enters the plant from intermediate pressure field gathering stations.  Jameson treats, processes, and fractionates flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantify containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\r\n\u00bf\tMethane\r\n\u00bf\tEthane\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane\r\n\u00bf\tButane\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane\r\n\u00bf\tPentane\r\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Jameson, which is part of the amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Jameson Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Action Plan and has coordinated with the community's local responders through mock emergency simulations to introduce the local responders to the facility and its personnel.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Jameson process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.  WTG considers the systems developed for compliance with PSM to be the basis for good safety and business practices.  In this effort, WTG identifies opportunities to continuously improve initiatives for each PSM element.  The"

Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to maximum intended inventory (MII), piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), area classifications, and material balances have been completed.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA new PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives conducted a PHA revalidation from June 10, 2019 through July 26, 2019.  A final report was completed December 16, 2019 and has been reviewed by all pertinent parties.  Results and recommendations from PHA analyses have been actively shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool is used for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures with references to pertinent PSI are available and were most recently updated as of November 20, 2020.  A written mentorship training program has been developed, implemented, and documented per employee.  A technical review of operating procedures is currently underway while also being formatted into a standard operating procedures format across WTG will be completed.

Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control, and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.  Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  The MOC documents and checklists are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\nA complete third-party MI gap assessment has been completed and updates implemented to Jameson's MI program.  The updates are based on revised comprehensive company inspection standards and procedures along with a specialized inspection program structured specifically for Jameson using Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) and meeting American Petroleum Institute (API) requirements.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nWTG investigates all PSM incidents.  Throughout the PSM program assessment process, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated, as necessary.  A mix of WTG personnel will be provided investigation methodology training to further enhance the program and ensure root cause is consistently identified.  A process safety tracking tool is used to track action items and incident investigation corrective actions to closure.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nTo meet compliance with PSM/RMP, WTG conducts compliance audits every three years to verify all PSM/RMP element requirements are being satisfied.
