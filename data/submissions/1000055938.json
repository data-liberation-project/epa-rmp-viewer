The facility has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instructions.\r\n\r\nThe process at this facility subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is a part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems used to control nitrogen oxide emissions generated from burning fossil fuels.  Units 5, 6, and 7 at Plant Barry are equipped with SCR systems.  Ammonia is also used in the treatment of the boiler water used in the facility.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Barry Steam Electric Generating Facility is focused on the safe management of anhydrous ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program at the plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: ensuring the system is designed and modified safely periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained is a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and conduction periodic Compliance Audits and incident investigations including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\r\n\r\nNo spills have occurred at this faci"
