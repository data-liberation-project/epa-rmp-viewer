This could effect 4,415 resident at an end point of 4.4 miles according to the calculations of EPA's RMP Comp (TM).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at our facility is:\n\n    This facility complies with all state and local codes and regulations. Our facility is inspected twice a year (spring and fall) by an inspector from the state of Iowa.\n\nFive year accident history.\n\n    We have never had an accident at our facility.\n\nThe emergency response program at our facility:           \n\n     In the event of an emergency at our facility, it is our policy to notify the Fairfax Fire Dept. and the LEPC requesting their assistance.
