It is our policy to comply with all federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occure, it is our policy to contact the Fairfax Fire Department and the LEPC.\n\n    This facility is an ag retail busness and we store anhydrous ammonia for retail to farmer customer.\nOur storage consists of two tanks, a 12000 and a 26000 gallon along with 21 nurse tanks,and associated pumps, compressors, and miscellaneous plumbing.\n \nThe worst-case release scenario.\n\nOur worst case scenario is the release of 160000 lbs. of NH3 when both tanks are filled to 85% resulting in a vapor and liquid release. This could effect 4,415 resident at an end point of 4.4 miles according to the calculations of EPA's RMP Comp (TM).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at our facility is:\n\n    This facility complies with all state and local codes and regulations. Our facility is inspected twice a year (spring and fall) by an inspector from the state of Iowa.\n\nFive year accident history.\n\n    We have never had an accident at our facility.\n\nThe emergency response program at our facility:           \n\n     In the event of an emergency at our facility, it is our policy to notify the Fairfax Fire Dept. and the LEPC requesting their assistance. Yearly we have a meetting and training session with the Fairfax Fire Dept. at our location so they know what is expected of them and to familiarize them with our facility.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  None at this time."
