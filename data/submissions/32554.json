Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4.

Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n     6. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards.

Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Safety Department.  The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n     11. Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n     12. Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Emergency Response\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan assures the readiness of employees to respond appropriately and safely to emergencies involving highly hazardous chemicals.  The Emergency Response Plan is an integrated set of actions that start at the incident source, and initiates actions throughout the facility as appropriate.  Additional details about our Emergency Response Program are presented later in this document.\n\n     14. Trade Secrets\n\nOSHA PSM requires the refinery to make available all information necessary to those persons responsible for compiling the process safety information, those assisting in the development of the process hazards analysis, those responsible for developing operating procedures and those involved in incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits, without regard to possible trade secret status of such information. Our facility openly provides this necessary information to all responsible persons to comply with these requirements.\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had one accident resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. The accident is deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in an onsite personnel injury that required medical treatment.  No offsite consequences occurred due to this incident. We have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  The following is a brief summary of the incident and the investigation results.\n\nOn August 18, 2000, an operator completed loading of an ethylene railcar, applied steam to the exterior of the loading hoses to vaporize any ethylene left in the hose, and depressured the hoses.  The operator verified that there was no pressure in the hoses and then proceeded to disconnect them when liquid ethylene discha"

Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior fire fighting techniques, hazardous material response, confined space and high angle rescue, emergency medical response, the Emergency Response Plan and implementation of the Incident Command System.  \n\nThe refinery also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and fire fighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and fire fighting foam.  An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.  Examples of equipment and systems included in the progr"

Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe are continually striving to make the Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery a safe workplace for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Our focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, and proactive management of these issues.  For example, we revalidate the Process Hazard Analyses for approximately six (6) process units each year.  These analyses generate additional prevention and mitigation recommendations that result in ongoing modifications to the facility.  In addition to the Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, the following list of improvements is being planned to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Upgrades to emergency response apparatus and other fire protection systems\n* Improvements to fire protection systems\n* Improvements to instrumentation and computer systems\n* Fire water infrastructure upgrades\n* Structural steel fireproofing upgrades\n\nThe goal of the Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery is to demonstrate contin"
