      "SummaryText": "The City of Middletown Water Department, hereafter referred to as the MWD, owns and operates the John S. Roth water treatment facility. For the purpose of this document the regulated substance in use at the John S. Roth water treatment facility is chlorine gas. The facility is located at 566 River Road in Middletown, CT. The facility is described as a direct filtration facility capable of treating 8 million gallons of water a day. Raw water is supplied to the facility by 10 wells located at the facility drawing water from an aquifer running along the Connecticut River. This facility supplies water to 70 percent of the City of Middletown on an average daily basis. The City of Middletown has a population of 43,000. The MWD has completed this update as part of our regulatory schedule. In 2020 the MWD switched the john S. Roth water treatment facility from chlorine gas to sodium hypochlorite. In 2021 the MWD has received final approval from the State of Connecticut Department of Public Heath to permanently switch from chlorine gas to sodium hypochlorite. The MWD plans to have chlorine gas storage at the John S. Roth water treatment facility below the RMP threshold by July 2021. The MWD is pleased to report that there has not been an accident with chlorine gas in the facility's history. In the event of a release the MWD's Emergency Response Plan is thorough and will be executed swiftly. The MWD's intent moving forward is to completely remove chlorine gas from the facility by 2022. Every effort is made to prevent a release."
