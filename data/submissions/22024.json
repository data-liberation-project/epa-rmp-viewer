THE FACILITY POLICY\n \nTHE OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES OF TRIANGLE AGRONOMY SERVICES, LLC ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILTY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n \n ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED  WOULD BE 210,000 POUNDS IN OUR (2) 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AND (32) 1,000 GALLON NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY  HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\nA.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANYHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.16 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENERIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE  PROVISIONS OF \" SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U. S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA),"

THE  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n THE FACILITY HAS:\n\n A. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARDS, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n B. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC. COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY. PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIO0NS. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
