Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc. [DCPC] is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2. Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nThe Lumberton MS facility has one regulated substance - Propane. At the facility, this liquefied gas is stored in up to 30 railcars which are offloaded into tank trucks or ISO containers and transported to customers who use it in aerosols products or refrigerants.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDCPC has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58 Standards, 2011 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\n\nDCPC maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\n\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\n\nTo ensure safe operati"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\n\nDCPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\n\nDCPC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\n\nWritten procedures are in place at DCPC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at DCPC. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Pa"

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\n\nDCPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\n\nDCPC truly believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, DCPC employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87]\n\nDCPC occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities or to assist with transloading operations. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. DCPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History [40 CFR Part 68.42]\n\n\n\nDCPC has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases at all its facilities nationwide. There have been no accidental releases at "

The plan includes all the applicable aspects of emergency response including evacuation, adequate first aid and medical treatment and notification of local emergency response agencies. \n\n\n\nThe ERP has been coordinated and verified with the Southeast Lamar Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n"
