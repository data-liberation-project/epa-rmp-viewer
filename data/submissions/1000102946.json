A primary objective of the conversion is to reduce the number of cylinder changes each day and year which should reduce the risk of a leak while changing out cylinders. The larger cylinders will also reduce the number of deliveries to the ADM Cheney mill. A complete design and replacement of the chlorine room is being implemented as a part of this process."

In the future there may be up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine onsite. Typical chlorine onsite will be less than 8,000 lbs. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nADM Cheney utilizes the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rules as the base for its chemical safety for the handling and use of chlorine. ADM has relied upon internal and external knowledgeable personnel to plan for and build the new chlorine room, update and write new procedures, and train facility personnel. The new Halogen valves, considered to be the best available technology are being utilized to minimize potential leaks as cylinders are changed and to isolate cylinders in the event a leak is detected in the system. ADM Cheney personnel have worked with the Cheney Fire Department throughout the design and build process. \nFive Year Accident History\nADM Milling-Cheney has had two minor leaks in the past five years while using 150 pound chlorine cylinders but neither incident qualifies as an accident. The estimated release amounts were under three pounds of chlorine with no injuries and no offsite impacts.\nEmergency Response Program\nADM Cheney has internal monitors and alarms for chlorine. They are connected to the Halogen main control valves and will shutdown chlorine service immediately when activated. These systems are periodically checked for functional capabilities. Preventative maintenance procedures are also followed. \nADM Cheney completes periodic training with employees and contractors. At least once per year evacuation drills are completed. \nADM Cheney communicates and plans with the City of Cheney Fire Department for emergency response. ADM will rely upon the Fire Department and the Spokane County EMA for communications with the public in the event of offsite evacuations.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safet"
