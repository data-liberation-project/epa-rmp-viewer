The risk management program is to be described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is registered with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and made available to the public.  At General Chemical Newark Works, two extraordinarily hazardous substances (EHSs) are managed in quantities greater than the threshold quantity.  The chemicals are Oleum (20-27%) and Sulfur Trioxide gas which is generated as an intermediate that is immediately used in another section of the system to produce Sulfuric Acid and Oleum.\n\n\n\nThis RMP update and updated off-site consequence analysis, are submitted to reflect the discontinued production and use of 65% Oleum and 98% Nitric Acid from our property.  The RMP was prepared in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:31-7.1, which provides a format for a written RMP.\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment was completed consisting of a new worst case release scenario and two alternative case release scenarios.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40CFR part 68 Subpart B (68.20-68.42) (incorporated by reference into N.J.A.C. 7:31), as well as guidance provided by the USEPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\n\n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAs part of General Chemical, Newark Works is committed to being a responsible member of the community.  General Chemical Corporate Policy dictates that facilities minimize the potential for adverse effects to the environment as well as to the he"

A key element of the General Chemical Health, Safety and Environmental Policy is fostering openness through dialogue with employees and the public.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We pay close attention to those chemicals which OSHA and the EPA identify as hazardous substances.  Our policy is to conform to all applicable laws and regulations, as well as codes and recommended practices to ensure the safety of the public and the environment.  We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely.  We also prepared for potential emergencies to protect employees and the public in the event of a chemical release.\n\n\n\nSafety is an important issue at Newark Works.  Monthly meetings are held with plant employees to address environmental and safety issues.  The plant also has regular audits, which are conducted by internal employees and corporate audit teams.  The recommendations obtained through these audits are used to improve the environmental health and safety status at Newark Works.\n\n\n\nIn addition to internal audits, the plant is inspected regularly by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for compliance with the state of New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Protection Act regulatory requirements.  These inspections have occurred annually since 1986 when the regulation became effective.\n\n\n\n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAt this facility, Sulfur is burned to form Sulfur Dioxide, which is reacted with air in catalytic converters to form Sulfur Trioxide.

The quantities of these chemicals maintained on site are as follows:  20-27% Oleum/5,000,000 pounds and Sulfur Trioxide/620 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.0    Key Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n3.1    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Oleum is the failure of a storage tank containing 2,000,000 pounds of 27% Oleum.  Secondary containment is considered in this scenario which has a surface area of 8,047 square feet.  The scenario assumes all Oleum in the storage unit would be spilled into the secondary containment area in 10 minutes.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point of 0.010 mg/l was calculated to be 2.0 miles based on a release rate of 42.78 pounds per minute.  The physical parameters of the Oleum are as follows:  27%, 120?F and 18 mmHg.  The calculation was performed using the EPA's Off-site Consequence Guidance Document (equation D-1 for toxic liquids was used which allows for the use of a specific temperature and vapor pressure).  The conditions defined by the EPA for modeling the worst case scenario are 1.5 m/s wind speed, F stability and an air temperature of 120?F.  The topography is urban.\n\n\n\n3.2    Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n3.2.1    The alternative case release scenario for Oleum is the failure of a transfer line during transfer from the process to the storage unit, which causes the release of 226.4 pounds in 10 minutes.  Administrative mitigation is considered in this scenario.  An Operator is on site at all times to shut down the process in emergency situations.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point of 0.010 mg/l was calculated to be 0.58 mile"

The conditions defined by the EPA for modeling the alternative case scenario are 3.0 m/l wind speed, D stability ad an air temperature of 100?F.  The topography is urban.\n\n\n\n3.2.2    The alternative case release scenario for Sulfur Trioxide is a failure in the transfer line causing the release of 320 pounds of Sulfur Trioxide gas in 10 minutes.  Administrative mitigation is considered in this scenario.  An Operator is on site at all times to shut down the process in emergency situations.  The gas concentration in the transfer line is 7%.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 0.010 mg/l was calculated to be 1.7 miles based on a release rate of 1.5 pounds per minute.  The EPA's Off-Site Consequence Guidance Document was used for these calculations.  The conditions for this model are 3.0 m/l wind speed, D stability and an air temperature of 100? degrees F.
