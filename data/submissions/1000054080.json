Chlorine is a vital part of this process.\n\nChlorine is received in individual one-ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine is injected into the water treatment system by automatic feeders.  The feed system uses a vacuum A?shut-offA? system which is designed to automatically shut the system down if a leak occurs.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the facility is 16,000 pounds.  \n\nThe prevention of unnecessary human exposure reduces the threat to the health and safety of employees as well as to nearby members of the community.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThis water treatment facility complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State of Arkansas codes and regulations.  Furthermore, the facility has stringent guidelines and practices for day to day procedures involving the chemicals.  These procedures have been updated to include recommendations by the EPA, such as A?Consequences of Deviation.A?\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was updated for the City of Hot Springs and the surrounding areas with the assistance of Affiliated Engineers, Inc.  This program has been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Hot Springs Fire Department.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the appropriate agencies and potentially affected members of the community.  In addition, it provides procedures for mitigating any releases that may cause harm to the community.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were examined for this facility using RMP Comp.  The population data used was determined by performing a house count of the area which would be affected by a release.  The remaining details and results of these calculations are included in the electr"

For example, chemical release is prevented by implementing such practices as daily maintenance checks of all chlorination equipment.\n\nNo chlorine related accidents have occurred at this facility in the last five years."
