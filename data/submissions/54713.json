      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThis Castaic Lake Water Agency (CLWA) Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant (RVWTP) Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the 5-year update requirement for the 2004 RMP and the 2009 RVWTP Expansion improvements which will include an increase in the maximum inventory of chlorine from 16 to 30 @ 1-ton cylinders.  The previous RMP submittals occurred on June 16, 1999 and June 16, 2004.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe CLWA RVWTP is located at 27234 Bouquet Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, California. RVWTP is on a property covering 65 acres. RVWTP is provided State Project water stored in Castaic Lake. The plant is currently capable of treating 30 million gallons per day (mgd) of water.  The planned RVWTP Expansion will start construction in 2009 and the improvements will allow CLWA to treat 60 mgd.\n\nRaw water is first delivered to the pre-ozone contactor where ozone is applied for pre-oxidation and pre-disinfection. Ozonated water then enters the rapid mix structure where coagulants are added. The water is then fed to up-flow clarifiers, and then to a gravity filtration system. In the final stage, filtered water is disinfected with chlorine, monitored for chlorine residual, dosed with ammonia to create chloramines and released to CLWA\u00bfs transmission system for distribution.\n\nPotentially hazardous chemicals that are stored and used onsite or for which storage is available include chlorine, aqueous ammonia (19%), hydrogen peroxide, diesel fuel, liquefied oxygen, and sodium hydroxide. Liquid chlorine, used for disinfection of water, is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of chlorine currently stored at the plant is currently 16 cylinders (32,000 pounds). When the RVWTP Expansion is complete, the maximum chlorine inventory will increase to 30 cylinders (60,000 pounds) and the chlorine will be stored in a new chlorine building.  The existing chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms will no longer store any chlorine.  Chlorine is present in quantities above the RM"

The Safety Coordinator maintains the ERP. The key elements of CLWA\u00bfs emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n\n* The plant uses a combination of audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\n\n* In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact the Los Angeles County Fire Department and evacuate to designated staging areas.\n\nCLWA\u00bfs Recent Steps to Improve Safety\n\nBased on CLWA\u00bfs dedication to process safety and the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) reviews that were conducted as part of the 2004 RMP update, CLWA has completed the following actions to reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chemical releases:\n\n* Removed boxes and wooden pallet in chlorine storage room.\n\n* Installed a new, \u00bfin-kind\u00bf chlorine scrubber in 2004 to replace existing unit to handle chlorine releases.\n\n* Maintains an annua"

The most recent compliance audit occurred in November 2008.\n\n* Require all RVWTP visitors (CLWA staff, contractors, landscapers, etc) to review a CLWA potential chemical hazards onsite and sign a log sheet to verify their understanding of onsite chemical safety issues."
