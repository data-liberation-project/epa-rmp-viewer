              "Description": "System Overview\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system provides storage, vaporization, transfer, and injection control facilities for the ammonia gas to support the selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  The application of Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction Technology (the process) reduces nitrogen oxide air emissions from the station.  There are two HRSG's in the plant, designated as Train 1 and Train 2.  Each HRSG has its own dedicated anhydrous ammonia storage and delivery system.  The system description below pertains to the Train 1 design and operation.  The Train 2 system design and operation is identical to Train 1.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Storage Vessel\n\n\n\nEach of the two ammonia storage and supply systems includes a 2,122-gallon horizontal, cylindrical, pressure vessel for storing liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  The storage vessel is sized to provide approximately 2.5 days of continuous supply of ammonia at the design usage rate of 230 lbs/hr for NOx reduction to 9 ppmv based on a 24-hour per day operation of Fuel Oil at -10?F in the GT.  When the GT is firing with natural gas, the vessel has approximately 10-14 days of storage.  The vessel is mechanically rated for 265 psig at 125?F.  The level in the vessel is administratively controlled to a maximum of 85% level, equivalent to 1,804 gallons.  The maximum intended site inventory of ammonia is therefore 3,608 gallons (18,580 pounds at 60?F) in total for the two ammonia storage vessels.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied by tanker truck through a liquid fill connection.  The connection is mounted directly on the top of the tank.  In the event of a pull away, a check valve on the delivery hose and the tank's excess flow valve will prevent ammonia releasing from the tank.   Ammonia is stored in a liquid state in equilibrium with its vapor at saturation conditions in a pressurized vessel.  The vessel is maintained at approximately 100 psig and 65?F by an electric vaporizer under drum pressure control via a PID loop controller (1CI-PIC-1570) modulating the heat input to the ammonia vaporizer.  \n\n\n\nThe level in the vessel is monitored through the local gauge (1CI-LI-1571), and remotely through the DCS (1CI-LI-1570).  A local level indicator (1CI-LI-1570A) and a local horn for high level alarm (1CI-LAH-1570) are also provided at the truck unloading station.  The ammonia tank pressure is indicated through a local gauge (1CI-PI-1571) and remotely through the DCS (1CI-PI-1570).  A high pressure switch (1CI-PSH-1572) will shut-off the vaporizer if the tank pressure increases to 165 psig.   The tank is supplied with a dual pressure relief valve set at 265 psig; excess flow valves at all fluid flow nozzles; and thermal relief valves set at 350 psig on associated liquid ammonia lines.  \n\n\n\nIn December of 2011, ammonia vapor crossover piping was installed.  The piping ties together the two ammonia vapor headers that are routed to each individual ammonia/air dilution skid and SCR.  The piping allows complete isolation of an individual storage tank while operating both SCR's from one storage tank and vaporizer.  However, due to the process design of the ammonia vaporizers, this operation is only possible while operating the facility on natural gas.  \n\n\n\nIn October of 2016, the system was upgraded with new Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Tank and Vaporizer pressure vessels.  The upgraded storage system included RFWN flanges at all tank connections, where possible, to prevent damage to tank nozzles when excess flow valves are changed on a routine basis, the elimination of liquid crossover line between tanks and corresponding tank nozzles since a vapor crossover line is now in place, incorporation of liquid and vapor-offloading connections made directly at the tank to eliminate liquid and vapor piping runs to each tank, and installation of a new unloading platform and entrance to the platform to provide personnel access to directly connect to each tank for ammonia offloads.  Additionally, the existing structural steel mounting skid for tanks and vaporizers was removed and new equipment was mounted to new concrete supports.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Vaporizer\n\n\n\nThe ammonia vessel is kept at the desired operating pressure of 100 psig by an electric vaporizer via a local PID loop pressure controller (1CI-PIC-1570).  Liquid anhydrous ammonia is vaporized by direct contact with the heating element.  The liquid ammonia feed line to the vaporizer is protected from over pressure at blocked in condition by a thermal relief valve (1CI-PSV-1582) set at 350 psig.  The ammonia vapor is piped back via the vapor line into the storage vessel.  The vapor from the vessel is then sent to the dilution air and injection control skid.  A remote pressure controller (1CI-PC-1573) set at 50 psig is provided on the vapor line to ensure a constant feed pressure to the dilution air system.  A high temperature cut-off switch (1CI-TSH-1571) is provided to shut-down the vaporizer if the heating element is in excess of 200?F.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Dilution Air and Injection Control Skid\n\n\n\nA dilution air and injection control skid is supplied for each HRSG to support the operation of the associated SCR system.  The skid consists of 100%-spare Dilution Air Blowers (1CI-BLR-1001A/B), Dilution Air Heaters (1CI-HTR-1001A/B), Ammonia/Air Mixer (1CI-MIX-1001), Ammonia Filter (1CI-FLT-1001) and Ammonia Accumulator (1CI-ACC-1001).\n\n\n\nAmmonia vapor is fed from the storage vessel to the dilution air and injection control skid under constant pressure control (1CI-PC-1573) set at 50 psig.  The ammonia injection rate is regulated via corresponding flow valves (1CI-FV-1600A [for oil operation] and -1600B [for natural gas operation]) under its respective flow controller (1CI-FC-1600).  The controller is reset by a function block (1CI-FY-1600) that automatically calculates the required ammonia injection rate to achieve the required NOx reduction depending on the GTG load and fuel type, as well as the firing rate of the HRSG duct burner.  The function block (1CI-FF-1601) receives the GTG exhaust gas calculated inlet NOx concentration signal (1GT-AI-1000) from the GT MARK VIe control system.  This function block also receives a calculated inlet NOx signal for the duct burner from the DCS via 1FG-FI-1802, 1CI-AY-1535 and 1CI-AI-1535.  The signal from 1CI-FF-1601 is sent to 1CI-FY-1600 and acts as a feedforward signal to rapidly adjust the ammonia flow valve to follow changes in load.  The ammonia flow is trimmed via a feedback signal (1CI-FF-1600, 1HR-AI-1513 & 1HR-AI-1533) from the exhaust NOx analyzer (1HR-AIT-1513) located at the stack.  Depending on the GT fuel type, the NOx outlet analyzer indicator in the DCS is 1HR-AI-1513 for GT firing with fuel oil and 1HR-AI-1533 for GT firing with fuel gas.  The combined feedforward and feedback signal is used to stimulate a faster response to modulate the ammonia flow valves (1CI-FV-1600A/B).  This allows rapid achievement of the specified outlet NOx without any large deviations from the setpoint.  A hand control station in the DCS (1CI-HS-1600) is provided for the operator to switch between the GT firing mode.  This sets the appropriate constants for the base ammonia flow demand and trim calculations.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia dilution air and injection control skid is supplied with 100%-spare ammonia Dilution Air Blowers (1CI-BLR-1001A/B).  Each blower is provided with an inlet filter/silencer unit.  The air flowrate is measured by 1CI-FT-1602 and monitored in the DCS via 1CI-FI-1602.  The air is heated in an electric Dilution Air Heater (1CI-HTR-1001A/B) prior to mixing with ammonia.  The air temperature outlet of the heater is 225?F and is monitored in the DCS (1CI-TI-1601).  The heater is controlled in the range of 200?F to 250?F by temperature switch (1CI-TSL-1601, 1CI-TSH-1601).  A local high temperature switch (1CI-TSH-1603A/B) is also provided to shut-off heater at 250?F.\n\n\n\nThe regulated ammonia flow passes through the Ammonia Filter (1CI-FLT-1001) and Ammonia Accumulator (1CI-ACC-1001) to remove any condensate.  It then flows to the Ammonia/Air Mixer (1CI-MIX-1001) where it is diluted with heated air from the Dilution Air Heater (1CI-HTR-1001A/B) before injection into the SCR catalyst.  Once mixed, the ammonia/air mixture is injected into the HRSG directly upstream of the SCR catalyst reactor via injection/balancing piping.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia injection control is activated automatically by a minimum condition permissive on the temperature at the SCR catalyst reactor inlet (1CI-TY-1503).  The system also needs to meet the following injection permissive conditions:  \n\n\n\nA.) GT load greater than 50% (1GT-JL-1006), \n\nB.) Dilution air temperature (1CI-TI-1601) leaving the dilution air heater greater than 150?F, \n\nC.) Dilution air flow greater than 3,000 lb/hr (1CI-FI-1602), \n\nD.) Flue gas temperature at SCR reactor (1CI-TY-1503) within a specified range (430 - 750?F for natural gas, 518 - 750?F for fuel oil), \n\nE.) Ammonia injection System On switch (1CI-HS-1601) is enabled.  \n\n\n\nThe system is automatically shutdown in the event of a GT trip (1GT-XA-1009), or loss of the start permissive conditions specified above.  In case of failure of the online Dilution Air Blower, the standby spare unit is automatically started through DCS logic.  Each blower is provided with running status (1CI-XL-1622A/B) in the DCS.  Each heater is also provided with a heater on signal (1CI-XL-1623A/B) and heater trouble alarm (1CI-XA-1623A/B) in the DCS.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart-Up \n\n\n\nAmmonia vessel is filled to a maximum of 85% storage volume per code requirement (OSHA 29CFR 1910).\n\n",

The maximum intended site inventory of ammonia is therefore 3,608 gallons (18,580 pounds at 60F) onsite.\n\n\n\nThe RMP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As EPN's anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare and maintain a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia system at EPN is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\nThis process is subject to Risk Management Program Level 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program Level 1.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe SCR and HRSG systems were designed and constructed in general accordance with applicable local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  Process verification takes place through design audits conducted by trained personnel and/or qualified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\n\n\n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of EPN's daily operations.  PM is performed on a schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases, the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by EPN meets the recommended equipment best management maintenance schedules.  Pressure vessels, emergency shutdown, controls, pumps, and other equipment associated with operating the SCR ammonia system is regularly inspected and tested.  Maintenance activities ar"

A medium to large leak of ammonia could be detectable from a safe distance through a visual white cloud escaping from the source leak.  Ammonia handheld direct reading instruments, fixed area monitors, and ammonia test paper are maintained at the facility to aid in the detection of an ammonia release.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC, or Newington Fire Department) is trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at Newington Energy.  \n\n\n\nEPN has developed an emergency response program contained within its Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to minimize the health, safety and environmental impacts from a release of hazardous materials, and to restore the facility to normal operating conditions as quickly as possible.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, to the general emergency response program, a unique emergency response procedure has been developed for response to releases from the SCR system as outlined below.\n\n o After all personnel move to a location lateral or upwind from the release area, they shall call the CONTROL ROOM and inform the CONTROL ROOM of the location (inside or outside) of the release and wind direction or direction in which the vapors appear to be moving (if known).\n\n o The CONTROL ROOM shall dispatch the First Responders to the scene.  \n\n o If it is safe to do so, First Responders shall coordinate with plant personnel to shut off all CONTROL ROOM and Admin Building ventilation systems to prevent the migration of the ammonia vapors into the building.  \n\n o Emergency Coordina"

The upgraded storage system included RFWN flanges at all tank connections, where possible, to prevent damage to tank nozzles when excess flow valves are changed on a routine basis, the elimination of liquid crossover line between tanks and corresponding tank nozzles since a vapor crossover line is now in place, incorporation of liquid and vapor-offloading connections made directly at the tank to eliminate liquid and vapor piping runs to each tank, and installation of a new unloading platform and entrance to the platform to provide personnel access to directly connect to each tank for ammonia offloads.  Additionally, the existing structural steel mounting skid for tanks and vaporizers was removed and new equipment was mounted to new concrete supports."
