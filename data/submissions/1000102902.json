Emergency action drills and drill evaluations are conducted every year; emergency operations and procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTwo recommended changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified as a  result of a Hazard Operability (HAZOP) study session with the facility management, operations and maintenance, and plant engineering that was conducted on June 13, 2022.  These recommended actions have now been either completed or evaluated for implementation as required."

The potentially public receptors affected within this distance includes 0.003 square miles of residential housing located about 1,055 feet northeast, and a public beach located about 800 feet west of the ammonia storage area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the spill of the ammonia solution as a result of the rupture of a flexible transfer hose during the bulk transferring of the solution from a tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The transfer pump is manually shut off within 15 seconds after the hose rupture.  The volume of spilled solution is estimated to be 87 gallons, which spills onto the paved ground that slopes into a sump.  The regulatory default meteorological conditions used were: wind stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, ambient air temperature of 77F and a release temperature of 101F (maximum daily temperature at the nearest monitoring station), 50% average humidity, and urban surroundings.  For this alternative release scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint listed in the OCA guidance document (Reference Table 23) is less than 0.1 miles from the ammonia storage area, which does not reach any public or environmental receptors. \n\nSummary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe general LADWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n-High level of training of the operators in safe handling of chemicals,\n-Effective preventive maintenance program,\n-Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment,\n-Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators,\n-Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and\n-Implementation of an auditing and inspecti"

This is an emergency ammonia scrubber intended to protect personnel present near the ammonia storage tanks from an ammonia vapor release from the storage tank pressure relief valves.\n\nThe tanks are located under a roof structure that provides protection from direct exposure to the sun and the rain.  The loading operator is provided with a readily accessible water supply to wash spills quickly.  All spills will be collected and disposed according to local, state and federal waste disposal requirements.  Flashing lights and audible alarms at the tanks and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 20 parts per million in the surrounding area.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe OCA is conducted in accordance with the latest RMP OCA guidance document that has been developed by the USEPA in conjunction with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The OCA is performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l or 200 parts per million, which is the Emergency Planning Guidance Level 2 (ERPG-2). \n\n  Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of a 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank containing ammonia solution; this storage quantity corresponds to 100% of the designed tank volume.  However, the maximum intended inventory is 25,500 gallons per tank (85% fill capacity).

The risks and safety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.\n\nAmmonia solution at 29% concentration (29% ammonia and 71% water) is stored in three 30,000 gallon aboveground tanks.  The maximum inventory is 25,500 gallons per tank (85% fill capacity).  The tanks are 40 feet long and 11 feet in diameter.

Each SCR system uses aqueous ammonia of 29% concentration for controlling (reducing) NOx emissions. Aqueous ammonia is stored in three 30,000 gallon stainless steel aboveground storage tanks, which supply aqueous ammonia to all the five electric power generating units.  Each tank is constructed within a secondary containment area and  located under a roof structure.  Each containment area is equipped with a sump and submersible sump pump to pump out rainwater.  The containment area is designed to hold the contents of each tank as well as account for a 25-year flood scenario.  The aqueous ammonia will be delivered to the site via a 5,000-gallon tanker.  The SCR system for each electric power generating unit also consists of an Ammonia Vaporizer Skid, Ammonia Injection Grid and the Catalyst. The generating units are equipped with SCR units to control NOx emissions, a combustion by product that is a precursor to ozone formation.    Ammonia is diluted with air and injected into the gas stream through nozzles.  The amount of ammonia introduced into the system varies based on NOx reduction requirements.  The use of aqueous ammonia requires the vaporization of the ammonia solution.  Vaporization of the ammonia and water is done prior to injection of the ammonia into the flue gas stream and an injection grid ensures proper distribution of the ammonia in the flue gas flow.  The mixture of ammonia and flue gas then passes into the catalytic reactor.  In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR, ammonia (NH3) gas, a reducing agent, is injected into the flue gas to react with Nox to form nitrogen gas (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  \n\nAqueous Ammonia Handling and Storage\n\nThe aqueous ammonia handling and storage systems supplies ammonia solution"

All applicable procedures of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the State and Federal Emergency Response Program requirements.                               \n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nScattergood Generating Station (SGS) is located at 12700 Vista Del Mar in Playa Del Rey, California 90293.  The facility is bounded to the west by the Pacific Ocean; to the east by a residential neighborhood of single-family dwellings, which are approximately 1,400 feet east of the aqueous ammonia storage area; to the south by Grand Avenue, beyond which is the Chevron El Segundo Refinery; and to the north by the Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The SGS is a generating facility designed to generate and supply electric power to the LADWP's system.  SGS consists of two steam turbine generators (STGs) 179-MW units (Units 1 & 2), one combined cycle generating system (CCGS, Unit 5/6) that consist of a natural gas-fired combustion turbine generator (CTG) paired with a hear recovery steam generator (HRSG) that would provide steam to drive a STG, and two simple cycle generating system (SCGS, Units 6 & 7) consisting of two natural gas fired CTGs. The steam turbine generator (Boiler 3), which was in operation in 2012 was decommissioned in 2015. The 56-acre SGS was constructed in approximately 1960.
