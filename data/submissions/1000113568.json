Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n?\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\n?\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methods used to perform Hazard Reviews serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?\tThe Process Safety Information and Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and   instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n?\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n?\tAn ongoing dialogue with the Will County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well to implement improvements as the need develops. \n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to co"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.

A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n?\tGas detectors have been installed at the facility which will alarm and shutdown pipeline delivery and truck unloading.\n?\tManual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\n?\tHigh pressure in the pipeline will automatically shutdown pipeline injection.\n?\tInterlocks on the spheres or cavern inlet valves will close if the level and/or pressure get too high.\n?\tSurveillance cameras have been installed for security and operational purposes.\n?\tThe Pipeline Control Center, which is operated 24 hours per day, has certain monitoring and remote ESD capabilities.\n?\tAll drivers are provided with driver loading safety training and a driver\u0092s loading handbook.\n\t\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\t\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Lemont Storage Facility within the last five years. \n\t\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\t\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emerge"

ONS management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUSTANCES\n\nThe Lemont Storage Facility is owned and operated by ONS. At the facility, normal butane, isobutane, propane, and natural gasoline are received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks or underground storage caverns until they are transferred, via pipeline to the customer. Additionally, propane is transferred via pipeline to our local truck terminal to be loaded on trucks for distribution. Propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (reported as an RMP flammable mixture) are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility. There are no RMP toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONS.
