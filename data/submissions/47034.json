      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nThe Kent County Levy Court has set a safety policy that requires the facility to meet or exceed \r\nany OSHA standard.  The Kent County Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility (KCRWTF) is \r\ncertified to ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001.  As a part of this certification, senior KCRWTF \r\nmanagement is committed to reducing the environmental, health and safety impacts of its \r\noperations.  A long term goal of the program is to eliminate the use of both gaseous chlorine and \r\nsulfur dioxide.  The program also establishes a short term goal of protecting the employee and \r\npublic health and safety.  This is accomplished by organizing, equipping and training a select \r\nteam of employees to respond to any incidents involving releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, \r\nand to installing monitoring, preventive and mitigation processes to prevent or reduce any \r\nreleases.\r\n\r\nKent County Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility and the regulated substances \r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nThe KCRWTF is a secondary wastewater treatment facility that handles the majority of \r\nwastewater generated within Kent County and some wastewater from areas in New Castle and \r\nSussex Counties that border Kent County.  The facility uses fine bubble aeration to initially treat \r\nthe wastewater followed by clarification.  The treated wastewater is then chlorinated to reduce \r\npathogens and dechlorinated to remove residual chlorine.  The regulated substances that are \r\nhandled on site are gaseous chlorine stored in up to eight (8) one-ton cylinders as a liquid under \r\npressure and sulfur dioxide stored in up to 6 (6) one-ton cylinders as a liquid under pressure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe KCRWTF has established detailed procedure for both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide \r\nsystems.  There are alarms and other engineering controls on both systems to prevent releases of \r\nthe regulated substances.  Additional monitoring systems have been a"

Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP\u00bfs) that meet the ISO 1001 \r\nand OHSAS 18001 requirements have been implemented and all operators are trained on these \r\nSOP\u00bfs.   Additional training has been provided to operators and local responders.  The operators \r\nhave been trained on how the control systems operate, what constitutes an emergency and how to \r\nrespond to any emergency.  Local responders have been trained on the expected hazards and how \r\nthe control systems operate.  The facility\u00bfs SCADA system monitors the system operations and \r\nalarms when unusual conditions occur.  The SCADA system is monitored by plant personnel 24 \r\nhours a day.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no major incidents involving the regulated hazards over the past twenty years.  \r\nA small release of chlorine (less than 100 pounds) occurred on July 31, 2006 which resulted in a \r\nmajor review of current SOP\u00bfs and operating systems with minor equipment and procedural \r\nchanges occurring as a result.  The release was confined to the immediate area of the system and \r\ndid not pose a risk to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving any of the regulated hazards, the local 911 center will be \r\ncalled.  A plant response team will be dressed out as required by the hazard and seek to respond \r\nto the incident and try to correct the problem.  Senior management at the facility will be \r\nmobilized as the control team.  The local volunteer fire departments will immediately be \r\ndispatched.  The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) will be notified and \r\nDNREC and other agencies will respond to provide appropriate support.  Kent County will also \r\nmobilize its emergency response unit.  The response team is currently under going retraining, \r\nadditional personal protective equ"

The facility will evaluate \r\nthe use of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection and intends to use it for an expansion.  The facility will \r\nalso seek to replace the chlorine with either liquid sodium hydroxide or solid calcium chloride."
