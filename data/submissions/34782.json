The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u00bfs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally an onsite HAZWOPER team is trained to respond to emergencies and assist community responders.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Sedgwick County Fire Department.  Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  The last drill held was with the Sedgwick County Fire Department, Station 34 a"

Nine chemicals in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  APMC manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).

These specialty chemicals are used by our customers to manufacture other product used in a variety of application.  Raw materials are received at our plant by rail car, bulk tank truck, drums and pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feed stock is then fed to vessels.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat and hydrogen, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into product crude.  The product crude is then purified via"
