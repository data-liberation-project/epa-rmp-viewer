Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nHoneywell Delaware is located on 50 acres.  Part of the site is located in Claymont, Delaware and part of the site is located in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.  The site includes several office buildings, manufacturing buildings, storage buildings, a maintenance shop, and a laboratory building.  There are approximately 33 Honeywell employees at the site.\r\n\r\nHoneywell Delaware operates 24 hours per day and manufactures fluosulfonic acid, boron trifluoride (BF3) and BF3 complexes.  Each of these processes is described in more detail below.\r\n\r\nBoron trifluoride is regulated by the RMP rule.  It is manufactured in the BF3 process on the Pennsylvania side of the plant, and used as a raw material in the BF3 Complexes process on the Delaware side of the plant.  It is a non-flammable, corrosive, compressed gas.  If released to the atmosphere, it forms a dense white vapor cloud.  It is packaged and shipped in cylinders and tube trailers under high pressure.  The boron trifluoride process areas are equipped with water spray systems and remote operated valves designed for emergency use.  Boron trifluoride is used to make adhesives, pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and flavors/fragrances.  The raw materials used to produce boron trifluoride are boric acid and fluosulfonic acid.  Boric acid is a solid white powder that is received in truck trailers.  Fluosulfonic acid is a colorless, corrosive liquid with a pungent odor and is stored on site in bulk tanks.\r\n\r\nBF3 complexes are manufactured on the Delaware side of the plant.  BF3 complexes are used to make adhesives, pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and flavors/fragrances.

One of the raw materials used to produce BF3 etherate is ethyl ether.  Ethyl ether is regulated by the RMP rule.  It is a flammable, liquid and is stored on site in a bulk tank under its own vapor pressure.  The BF3 complexes process area is equipped with a water spray system and remote operated valves designed for emergency use.\r\n\r\nFluosulfonic acid (FSA) is manufactured on the Pennsylvania side of the plant.  It will be stored as a feedstock for the existing boron trifluoride process.  Fluosulfonic acid is produced using the chemicals anhydrous hydrofluoric acid (HF) and sulfur trioxide (SO3), both, regulated by the RMP rule.  Anhydrous HF is a clear, colorless fuming liquid with an extremely acrid odor. SO3 is a clear, colorless, and corrosive oily liquid that will rapidly react with water to form sulfuric acid.  HF and SO3 are stored onsite in separate bulk tanks, supported by mitigation system and secondary containment.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program at Honeywell Delaware consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.  Also described within each of these elements are associated chemical-specific prevention steps, where applicable.\r\n\r\n3a. Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for processes involving boron trifluoride, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and ethyl ether.

A special committee named the Delaware Safety Council, made up of employees from each of the functional areas of the plant, meets monthly to review the status of in-progress safety action items, review safety policies and procedures for the plant, and recommend changes if necessary.  Employees routinely have opportunities to participate in other safety processes under the prevention program such as process hazard analyses, management of change, employee training, and incident investigations.\r\n\r\n3k. Hot Work Permits\r\n\r\nHoneywell Delaware has established a hot work permit system.  The hot work permit system applies to processes involving boron trifluoride, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide, and ethyl ether.  Under the system, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations.  Hot work operations may include burning, welding, or torch cutting.  The hot work permit indicates the type and method of hot work to be conducted, the equipment the hot work will be performed on, the date, time, and location authorized for the hot work, the presence of fire prevention and protection systems meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and signatures of the supervisory employees authorizing the hot work.  A separate hot work permit must be issued for each hot work operation, and a separate hot work permit must be issued for each day.  A copy of the hot work permit must be displayed at the job location while hot work is in progress, and the permit is maintained on file after the completion of the hot work.\r\n\r\n3l.

The information supplied by the contractor is retained while the contractor is engaged in work activities.\r\n\r\nPrior to commencing work on site, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation provided by Honeywell.  The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the site emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of site safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the site, including the date the training was completed.  Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site.  Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dismissal from the site.\r\n\r\n4.
