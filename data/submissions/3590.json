The realistic scenario selected and modeled for anhydrous ammonia was the release that resulted from a broken feed line from the storage tank to the process.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nPTI has a comprehensive release prevention program.  PTI has in place, physical safeguards to prevent a release of anhydrous ammonia.  PTI also follows best industrial practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes excess flow valves, safety release valves, and ammonia sensors.\n\nFive Year Release History\nPTI has not had an accident in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response\nPTI has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes detection alarms, emergency shut down procedures, excess flow valves, and a scrubbing system.  In the event the release can not be controlled completely by these systems, PTI has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\nSafety Improvements\n PTI has ammonia sensors two ammonia sensors located north and south of the ammonia tank. The sensors trigger an alarm to let the operators know that there is a release in progress and that the EmergencyRresponse Plan needs to be activated\n\nY2K Sensitivity\nPTI is aware and sensitive to the Year 2000 software issue.  Our process and equipment has been surveyed for compliance with good results.  There were no concerns identified.  The Sunter facility will be closed and all processes secured on the evening of December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000.  PTI will conduct a pre-startup safety review prior to the next operating day."

      "SummaryText": "PHIBRO-TECH, INC.\nSUMTER, SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nIntroduction\nPhibro-Tech, inc. (PTI) is located approximately 4.0 miles south of the city limits of Sumter, South Carolina in the Sumter Industrial Park off U.S. Highway 15.  PTI's facility encompasses about 58 acres.  The manufacturing facility encompasses about 11 acres at the southern end of the property.  PTI is committed to the safety and well being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  PTI is an active member in the Sumter County Chamber of Commerce Environmental Group and the South Carolina Occupational Safety Council.  The chemical that this report will deal with is Anhydrous Ammonia.  PTI's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have a contingency plan to respond promptly and safely to such a release. \n\nRegulated Substance\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address the following regulated substance at the PTI facility.\n\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received from LaRoche Industries Inc., Naperville, IL in tank trucks.  PTI has a 12,000 gallon ammonia tank at the facility that is leased from LaRoche Industries Inc.\n\nWorst Case & Alternate Scenarios\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined the Worst Case Scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all the contents of the facilities largest storage vessel in 10 minutes, assuming all safeguards have failed , during extremely stable weather conditions.  Our scenario would involve an 80%  full 12,000 gallon tank of Anhydrous Ammonia (9600 gallons or 50,000lbs.).\nThe EPA has also specified in the RMP rule that each facility define a specific Alternate or Realistic Scenario that could also have off site impact, based on plant operations.  The realistic scenarios are to be modeled using the actual active and passive mitiga"
