The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in\n\n1954 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA.  The company has grown to it's\n\ncurrent  through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in\n\n1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991.  This particular facility was established in 2007.\n\n\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed\n\nour customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner,and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees.\n\n\n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan\n\n(RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia.  Our commitment to Responsible Distribution\n\nProcess (RD) provides our company with an integrated health,safety,security, environmental and product\n\nstewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities. Our dedication to the proper\n\ndistribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first\n\nresponders and other industry personnel to enhance the protection of our employees and community\n\nneighbors.\n\n\n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia.

The largest users of\n\nammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some\n\nagricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex\n\nfertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning\n\nsolutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various\n\nprocesses. Ammonia is recognized as an \"ozone safe\" refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\n\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages. Accompanied\n\nwith a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be \"auto-repulsive\". These characteristics provide us with\n\nan early warning of the material's presence and force us to retreat from ammonia contaminated\n\natmospheres. High concentrations could have more serious health effects. These could include convulsive\n\ncoughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or\n\nammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical\n\nattention.\n\n\n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets, wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training\n\nprograms as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Adminis"

Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways\n\nto improve safety performance. Each facility has an individual safety committee comprised of site employees\n\nand management. These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well\n\nas at our customer facilities. The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee. The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management,compliance personnel, headquarters employees, and field personnel that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, provide recommendations and implementation guidance. Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department. As a whole, these systems provide Tanner Industries, Inc. with a continuous process for the identification of safety improvement opportunities thus reducing any risk to our society associated with a release of this important chemical.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Tanner Industries, Inc.

In support of our policy, the following is a typical list of safety equipment and systems employed at this facility.\n\n\n\n1)Employees are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment to ensure protection from ammonia exposure during the performance of their work functions or emergency escape procedures.\n\n\n\n2)Pressure relief valves are employed on all storage, transfer and delivery equipment to handle unexpected increases in pressure. Per their operational design, these valves will reset after relieving only the excess pressure. Depending on their situational placement in the process, these valves may be designed to relieve pressures caused from either vapor or liquid.\n\n\n\n3)Excess flow shut off devices are incorporated through out the process as prescribed by federal regulation. These valves are designed to stop the flow of liquid material any time their rated flow capacity is exceeded. These valves are designed to prevent the catastrophic release attributed to a storage tank line or valve break.\n\n\n\n4) Breakaway valves are installed at the unloading platforms.  These valves are designed to seperateand stop the flow of liquid material, minimizing damage to piping and other equipment. \n\n\n\n5)Pneumatically actuated emergency shutoff valves (ESVs) are designed to stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia from all stationary storage vessels and rail cars.
