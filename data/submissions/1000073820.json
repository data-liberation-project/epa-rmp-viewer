All sections of the RMP have been updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Bayer CropScience (BCS) Kansas City site is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of chemicals in our manufacturing processes using tools such as Hazard and Operability studies and modeling programs, and we seek out ways in which to reduce those risks. The site has an established committee comprised of members with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise that meets regularly to discuss accidental releases and opportunities for prevention. It is our policy to proactively implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases. If such a release does occur, our personnel are at hand to address the effects of the release. The site has maintained a long-standing working relationship with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Kansas City, Missouri emergency response community including HAZMAT 71 that ensures their support in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary activities at our facility are the manufacture and formulation of crop protection chemicals. There are five regulated chemicals present at our facility above threshold quantities. These chemicals are essential raw materials for the production of crop protection products, and are: 1) carbon disulfide, 2) chlorine, 3) formaldehyde, 4) hydrazine, and 5) anhydrous hydrogen chloride.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

This manufacturing facility was designed and constructed generally in accordance with NFPA-30, which was in effect at the time of construction. A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The facility is also subject to the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC) under 40 CFR 112, the RCRA Preparedness and Prevention regulations and Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures under Subpart C and D of 40 CFR 264, and EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. In addition, the facility is also subject to the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard (CFATS) under 6 CFR 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe BCS Kansas City site has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years; there has been one RMP reportable accidental release of chlorine during this period. There was no offsite impact from this release.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe BCS Kansas City site maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The site has an on-site emergency brigade comprised of approximately 60 employees providing coverage 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. The brigade is trained to address fire, medical, hazardous material, and rescue emergencies. The HAZMAT team and emergency brigade provide initial response for any emergencies that may occur. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is reviewed annuall"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe BCS Kansas City site is regulated under CFATS and is in full compliance with security plan submittal requirements. Security upgrades have been made in accordance with the Site Security Plan and additional upgrades are constantly being evaluated. The site is currently replacing the site-wide fire alarm system. The new alarm system provides highly-reliable notification in the event of fire, spill, or other emergencies. Additional high integrity safeguards using enhanced inerting and grounding systems are installed and are constantly being evaluated to prevent flammable vapor explosions. Finally, Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) have been installed, ensuring very high reliability process control system safeguards in the RMP related production plants.\n\n\n\n"
