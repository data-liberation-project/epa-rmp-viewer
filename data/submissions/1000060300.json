The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n\r\n(8) Rooms\r\n(12) Degreening Rooms\r\n\r\nEach room is equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\n\r\nAll control valve groups are located along the exterior wall of the cold storage and inside the hallway (near the packaging equipment). The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\r\n\r\nMachinery Room\r\n(3) Screw compressors\r\n(3) Oil separators\r\n\r\nCondenser Area\r\n(2) Evaporative condensers\r\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\r\n(1) Main suction accumulator\r\n(1) High pressure receiver\r\n\r\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers whe"

As such, the refrigeration system at Porterville Citrus Rayo is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nPorterville Citrus Rayo has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\r\n \r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Porterville Citrus Rayo facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 13,000 LBS. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Porterville Citrus Rayo has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Porterville Citrus Rayo, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Porterville Citrus Rayo has update their unified RMP-PSM Program.

This has improved Porterville Citrus Rayo's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Porterville Citrus Rayo's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nPorterville Citrus Rayo has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Porterville Citrus Rayo has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Porterville Citrus Rayo now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Porterville Citrus Rayo employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Porterville Citrus Rayo will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
