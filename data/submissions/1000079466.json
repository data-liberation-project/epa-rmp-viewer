Alarms are placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered. There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\nThe Windy Hill Fire Department has visited the facility (under previous ownership) and will continue be welcomed under Ruiz Foods ownership  to review the process operations, safety systems and discuss emergency response coordination.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFacility installed EPCS to prevent future releases from becoming catastrophic.  This addition shuts down the whole system down and equalizes pressure among all facility vessels. Training on this installation was completed 3/28/2019. \n\nThe facility also recently conducted a Process Hazard Analysis for the Condenser SRV removal, and a 5 year revalidation of the Process Hazard Analysis as well as a Compliance Audit.
