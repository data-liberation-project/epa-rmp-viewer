Wis-Pak Foods' policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in order to 1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, 2) reduce the threat to employees' health, and 3) reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used, the training of personnel, and the manner in which an accidental release is handled.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEmmber Foods Slaughter and Boning Plant is a cattle slaughtering facility.  There is one regulated process at Emmber Foods, the use of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration.  There is a single anhydrous ammonia system at the facility with a total of approximately 18,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\nEmmber Foods used the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" to determine the worst-case release scenario.  Failure of the largest vessel would release 1,095 pounds of ammonia per minute.  Standard operating procedures limit the filling of this vessel to 90% of capacity.  This vessel is located outside, therefore, no passive mitigation was considered for the worst-case release.  From the EPA guidance document, it is assumed that the release will last for ten minutes and reach an endpoint of 200 ppm a distance of 1.2 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nEmmber Foods used the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" to calculate an alternative release scenario.  Emmber Foods chose the failure of a transfer hose as an alternative release scenario.  Failure of a liquid ammonia transfer hose connected to a service valve with 1/4 inch pipe threads could release 189 pounds of ammonia per minute over a 10 minute period.  The distanc"

Emmber Foods has ammonia detectors in place for early detection of a release or leak.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nEmmber Foods implements an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  Employees receive training on an annual basis.  The facility will notify the fire department in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEmmber Foods believes that safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Improvements to the program will be made as the opportunity arises."
