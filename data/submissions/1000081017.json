      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nDairy Farmers of America, Inc. owns the Dairy Maid Dairy (DMD) facility located in Frederick, Maryland. The Dairy Farmers of America DMD facility is part of a cooperative, owned and operated by the area dairy farmers.  Dairy Farmers of America is one of the country's most diversified U.S. manufacturers of dairy products, food components and ingredients and is the premium provider of market opportunities for farmers and a value-added supplier of innovative dairy products and food components for customers around the world.\n\n\n\nThe Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. DMD facility's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains an employee Safety Committee. The emergency coordinator is the Plant Manager / Maintenance Manager.  Dairy Farmers of America has a corporate structure to support the DMD team in regards to compliance issues including Emergency Action and Response Plan activities.  The Action Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at needed.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Dairy Maid Dairy facility is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia (12,307 pounds), from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and cold storage of seafood products"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n\n\nNOTE: The quantity in this submittal is provided based on the EPA rule of reporting to two significant figures; therefore, when the Worst Case Release was reported, it was reported as 12,000 pounds. However, the written Hazard Assessment report modeled the entire 12,307 pounds.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 30 psig on the low pressure side of the system to approximately 165 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Standard 2 (2014) Safe Design of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\n?    IIAR Standard 6 (2019) Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\n\n\nThe DFA Dairy Maid Dairy ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed "

Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over-pressurization.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA RMP defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study on March 7-8, 2019 there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (March 2014 - March 2019). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.  \n\n\n\nPlant personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Plant Manager.  The Pl"

Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, initially performed March 2019, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The PSM team is continually meeting and reviewing the programs with a focus on the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
