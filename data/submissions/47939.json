The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nInland Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Inland Cold Storage is scheduled to be completed March 2007.  The facility is located at 3001 Sierra Pine Avenue, Vernon, California,  90058.  It is owned and operated by Inland Cold Storage.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 17,650 pounds of ammonia in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Inland Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.

For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\nThe facility, including the ammonia system, was constructed in accordance with the 2001 California Mechanical Code, Chapter 11, Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration (ANSI/ASHRAE 15 - 1999), Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (ANSI/CGS, G2.1 - 1989), as well as the 1997 Uniform Fire Code.  These codes specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the codes listed above, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility is scheduled to begin operations in March 2007; therefore, there is no ammonia accident history.  In addition, Inland Cold Storage currently operates four other ammonia refrigeration warehouses and none have had an accidental release of ammonia in the last five years (February 2002 - February 2007).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Inland Cold Storage facility has an emergency action plan in effect.

Inland Cold Storage plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nInland Cold Storage is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
