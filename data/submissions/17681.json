If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizer for the sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed. The maximum quantity stored would be 53,000 pounds in or 12,000 gallon storage tank. \n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n\nThe altenative release scenario based on th five year accident  history (or the most likey potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of the Kansas Department of Agriculture who regulates anhydrous ammonia in the state of Kansas. We have also implemented the rules set forth by OSHA  which can be found in 1910.111, \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidnetal releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA. we have also reported to the LEPC  and local fire department the quanities and location of our anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOur goal is to continue to build on our "
