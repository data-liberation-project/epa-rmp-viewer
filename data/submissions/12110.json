ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n    POLICIES\n\nThe emergency response procedures for the facility are included as part of the \"Training Programs\" manual.  These procedures were designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n    1.    To save lives.\n    2.    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n    3.    To protect the environment.\n    4.    To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  This manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility. \n\nB.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe JFJ Bronco facility is located at 6342 Bystrum Avenue, in Ceres, California.  The facility is situated on 80 acres in a rural area located off of Keyes Road which is approximately 5 miles south from Highway 99 on Crows Landing Road.   With the exception of one chiller, all of the ammonia equipment is located outside throughout the facility.  There is one chiller, the mezzanine chiller, that is located inside.  It is isolated from personnel and the room is equipped with an ammonia sensor and exhaust fan.  The one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide are located outside in the crush area; however, the smaller cylinders are used throughout the plant. The facility was originally built in 1974.\n\nAMMONIA\nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators to remove heat from the space or products to be cooled.  An evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows.  Due to the low pressures and corresponding low temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant quickly evaporates, absorbing a great deal of heat from the surrounding area.  To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid am"

It pulls refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the evaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature.  At the same time it pressurizes the warm vapor and forces it into the condenser and the high side of the system.  Refrigeration compressors on the market today are screw type, reciprocating, and centrifugal.  \n\nExpansion valves regulate the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a large pressure drop.  These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporator (low side).  This valve, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby creating the cooling capabilities of the system.  The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver.  Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor.  A condenser will typically use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser.  As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from this vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the receiver.  The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side.  It also serves to hold the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\n\nThe JFJ Bronco ammonia systems are utilized in two processes that are connected and co-located:  Champagne and Main. JFJ Bronco's two ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pre"

Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 27 psig on the low pressure side of each system to 200 psig on the high side.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is of 200,000 pounds.\n\nSULFUR DIOXIDE\nSulfur dioxide is used in the crush process.  Sulfur dioxide from a one-ton container is pushed, using house nitrogen at approximately 80 psi, through a flexible line to a filter.  Downstream of the filter, the sulfur dioxide flows through a rotameter, a solenoid valve, and into the crusher.  The pipeline is filled with sulfur dioxide up to the solenoid valve.  At this point, the flow is dependent on the demand at the crusher.  When the pump at the crusher is turned on, the solenoid valve opens allowing the flow of sulfur dioxide into the crusher unit.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide is five one ton containers or 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nC.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nSince this facility has two regulated substances, the Hazard Assessment analyzed the \"worst case\" release from both the ammonia refrigeration process and the sulfur dioxide process.  This comparison was prepared by releasing the contents of the largest vessel from each process and determining the maximum downwind distance to the respective toxic endpoint.  Using EPA Risk Management Program guidance documents, it was determined that the worst case release is from the ammonia refrigeration system because it has the potential to affect a larger number of off-"

Therefore the total quantity of ammonia in both vessels will comprise the largest vessel at the facility.  The horizontal vessels measure approximately 4.5' OD x 25' and 6.5' OD x 22'.  Assuming that these vessels are completely full, the total quantity is calculated tp be 43,960 pounds.  Since there these vessels are stored outside, no passive mitigation measures were applied to determine the release rate.  The release rate is the total quantity that could be inside these vessels, divided by 10 minutes: 4396 lbs/min.\n\nThe meteorological conditions used were 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere were several recommendations resulting from the development of the PSM/RMP document including recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis studies.  These Teams made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  The majority of these recommendations are expected to be implemented by December 1999; however, there are a couple that will require additional time and the anticipated completion date is July 1, 2000. Some of these changes are listed as follows:\n\nCHAMPAGNE SYSTEM\n    Install an emergency shut off valve on the liquid outlet line of the Champagne System's High Pressure Receiver (as close to the vessel as feasible).  \n\n    Connect the shut off valve in NH3-R01 to remote emergency shut down buttons located in areas away from the ammonia systems. \n\n    Examine the release locations of all ammonia pressure relief valves at the facility and redirect the exhaust from any relief valve that currently exhausts in a location that could injure nearby personnel.
