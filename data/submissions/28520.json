This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation,operation and maintenance of our NGL Storage facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe NGL Storage facility, located at 3051 North Ventura Ave in Ventura, California stores and transfers a flammable mixture containing butane, isobutane, propane, ethane and methane which is produced from oil wells or at Aera Energy?s Gas Processing Plant (Plant 7). This facility intermittently loads or unloads these products through a loading rack into Tanker Transports.  The product stored is a flammable mixture known as BP Mix that contains butane, isobutane, and propane which are flammable gases liquefied under pressure. Current regulated substances are butane , isobutane, propane \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release incident at the NGL storage facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank of BP Mix.  The release amount would be 150,000 pounds, which is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at this facility is a vapor cloud fire due to a 1? BP Mix connection line failure due to maintenance error, corrosion, extern"

The flammable cloud may travel up to 130 feet in typical weather conditions before dispersing below flammable concentrations. Flammable gas detectors are located throughout the facility, with automatic isolation of storage tanks on detection. A sustained release may occur if the facility is unattended and the wind is blowing the vapors away from any gas detectors. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility. Because processes at the Storage facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulation , they are also subject to Cal/OSHA?s process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention plan.\n\n\nManagement System for RMP and PSM\n\nAera Ventura Operations has developed a management system in order to define all elements required by the process safety standard and risk management program. The management system defines for each program element the following:\n1. Purpose and scope of element\n2. Specific procedures\n3. Responsible and accountable personnel using a RACI (responsible, accountable,consult,inform) chart, \n4. Verification and measurement metrics\n5. Feedback mechanism\n6. Document locations for applicable documents\n\nThe management system is available for review at either facility.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAera Energy Ventura Operations encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as a part of the N"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that is maintained at both facilities and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, Aera Ventura operations utilizes behavior based safety management (BBSM), an employee directed process to observe and review operations to assure safe behaviors are maintained and unsafe behaviors are corrected with peer feedback and corrective action plans.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe NGL Storage facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel within the facilities are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the management system.\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS?s). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. pressure, tank levels, temperature) in a key process parameter document. The facility ensures that process is maintained within these limits using process controls, and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe Storage facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and constr"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBoth of Aera?s Ventura PSM facilities has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nAera?s Ventura plants primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis in recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. A team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise conducts the analyses.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA teams findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from original design safety features, the facilities periodically update and revalidate "

This is accomplished by providing contractors with \n(1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor and audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations through the internal safety and environmental auditing (ISEA) process.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews(PSSR?s)\n\nBoth Aera facilities conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for start up prior to placing equipment into service. The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nAera?s facilities has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems are in a safe operating condition.

The periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBoth Aera Ventura facilities maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Aera?s facilities have implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n\nAera Energy uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance, inspection and construction activities.

In combination, these activities form a process that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nPersonnel involved in maintenance activities receive training on (1) a overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a significant deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Aera Ventura Operations incorporate quality assurance measures into the equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAera?s safe work practices are in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a energy control  procedure to ensure the safe isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (hot w"

These procedures (and others), along with training affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nAera has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAera promptly investigates all incidents, which results in or could have reasonably resulted in a major accident, which also includes near misses.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify causal factors and root causes, then develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Aera uses the Taproot? root cause methodology for this level of incident investigation. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to local management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

      "SummaryText": "investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so reports can be reviewed during future PHA?s and PHA revalidation.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Aera periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to local management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the NGL storage facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Aera Ventura Operating Area. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Ventura NGL Storage facility has safety features on many processes to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) to reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon (LEL) gas detectors provide alarms and subsequent actuation of shutdown valves(SDV?s)\n\n2. Low pressure alarms and subsequent actuation of shutdown valves(SDV?s) for  loading rack and product pipelines\n\n3. High pressure alarms and subsequent actuation of shutdown "

There has been 2 onsite events, one in 1998 and one in 1996 both involving a small release of normal butane (exact quantity unknown). No offsite consequences occurred in these incident(s) and would not meet the definition of a serious offsite or onsite incident.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nAera Energy maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of fire or explosion.  The plans address response for credible events, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plan and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, post incide"
