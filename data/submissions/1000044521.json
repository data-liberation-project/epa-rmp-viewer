These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \r\n\r\nThe primary business of C&S - Orlando is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 29,688 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Distribution Center is located at 4401 Seaboard Road in the north central part of Orlando, Florida.  The facility consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution.\r\nThe Orlando Distribution Center has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the northeast corner of the building in the northeast corner of the property in the compressor room.  To the south of this room outside, the high pressure receiver (HPR) is located alo"

The Low Temperature Recirculator is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding 15,282 lbs. of ammonia when filled to 100 percent capacity.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\r\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S - Orlando to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Orlando's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the freezer warehouse that will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection in those locations.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Technicians.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (June 2009 - June 2014). There have been no releases of ammonia resulting in injuries at the facility either.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Orange County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\r\n\r\nThere is a specific Corporate C&S program (CEHS-"

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, three Revalidations of the Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted as follows:\r\nPrevious studies have been conducted at the facility as follows [40 CFR 68.67(a)].\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPHA Study -2001 \r\n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation 1 - 2006\r\n\u00bf\tPHA Revalidation 2 - 2011\r\n\r\nThe studies consisted of:\r\n\r\n- What-If Studies\r\n- series of safety checklists; and\r\n- facility inspection.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation measures (recommendations) include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.
