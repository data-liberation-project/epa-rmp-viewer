The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Padonia Grain Farmers, Reserve location, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and retail sales of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 100,000 pounds in our 12,000  gallon storage tank and all nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.  Not included.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nPadonia Grain Farmers, Inc. has implemented a safety program that details the proper operations of the anhydrous ammonia facility, including step-by-step procedures for day-to-day operations as well as periodic checks to ensure proper equipment use and maintenance.  This program encorporates the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia?. \n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
