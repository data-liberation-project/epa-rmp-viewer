Implementation of actions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Actions implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe process hazard analysis for each process unit is updated and re-validated at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are reviewed with management personnel for resolution and any actions that result are tracked until they are completed.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery utilizes written procedures that address various phases of process operations including (1) initial startup of a newly constructed process, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) emergency shutdown.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent initial or refresher training of operators.  The procedures are managed by operating personnel and are updated as necessary to reflect changes and new information.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually to verify that they are current, updated, and accurate. \n\nOperating procedures and operating manuals are available in hard copy format in each process unit control room.\n\nOPERATOR TRAINING\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Rodeo Refinery has a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New employees must successfully complete up to 4 weeks of basic training on refinery operations before receiving their unit-specific training.  Basic training addresses applied sciences, job fundamentals, operating skills, and understanding basic refining processes.  The t"

It typically takes 8-24 weeks to qualify for a specific operating post.  Throughout the training process, candidates must continue to qualify by passing written and oral tests, thereby demonstrating understanding and retention of the training materials.  Qualification for all operating posts within a process area can take up to 3 years.\n\nRefresher training on operating procedures is provided to operating employees at least every three years, and refresher safety training is performed annually.  In addition, training emphasizing specific topics is performed as necessary (for example, furnace operation, dock operations, etc.).  Prior to the commissioning of new or modified equipment, written operating procedures are developed and training is provided to affected operating personnel.  Operating personnel also receive training in emergency response and fire fighting procedures.  \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY/MAINTENANCE TRAINING\n\nThe first step in a successful mechanical integrity program is ensuring that equipment and processes are properly designed for their intended use.  The Rodeo Refinery utilizes specific written procedures and design criteria for its operating equipment.  These criteria are contained in Engineering Standards -- referenced to recognized industry standards (such as API, ASME, ANSI, and NFPA) -- or specified by engineering firms with expertise in a specific area of design.  \n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, instrumentation and emergency shutdown systems, pumps, and compressors in proper operating condition.  The basic elements of this program include: (1) appropriate training or equivalent work experience for those responsible for procuring, installing, maintaining, inspecting, and repairing p"

Qualifications of these employees depend on the needed type and level of expertise.  The qualifications include either a four-year degree at an accredited college or equivalent work experience, certification by the governing board in their specialty, or journeyman level skills.  In addition to their specialized education and training, employees and contractors working in the area of mechanical integrity receive summary training on process hazards, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, and safe work practices.\n\nPredictive maintenance inspections and tests are performed on equipment to help ensure that it functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (for example, adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, necessary actions are taken to address the deficiency, up to and including shutting down and removing the equipment from service for repair or replacement.  \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Rodeo Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform the work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills for the tasks they are to perform, (3) are aware of the hazards of the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that their activities may introduce into the plant, and (7) know what to do if they encounter a hazardous condition in the course of their work.  \n\nThe qualification process for new contractors includes a review of the contractor's safety performance and references from other companies that have used the contractor.  Additionally, Tosco personnel perform an audit of the contractor's written safety programs.  This audit is performed by a team consisting of Tosco and contractor employees (usually the Safety Manager and/or Field Safety Supervisor) using a standard checklist developed by Tosco.  Any deficiencies in the contractor's safety programs must be corrected to Tosco's satisfaction before a contractor is qualified to bid on work at the refinery.\n\nTosco requires that contractor employees complete overview training before being allowed access to our facilities.

Deficiencies noted during an audit must be corrected either immediately or within five working days, depending on how severe the deficiency is.  Tosco also periodically conducts update audits of the contractor's written safety program.\n \nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has a program to manage changes to unit operations.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals and feedstocks, technology, procedures, and other facility changes are authorized and properly reviewed before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage and control any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing safeguards are not compromised by the change.  This review process is documented utilizing the Management of Change Form.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated to reflect a change.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change prior to its start-up.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery conducts pre-startup safety reviews for a new facility or facility modification to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

This procedure ensures that events that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a fire or explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the event or a similar event.  Investigation findings and recommendations are documented and reviewed with management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and reviewed with workers who could be affected by the findings.  Any actions resulting from investigations are tracked until they are resolved.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future process hazard analyses.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the Process Safety Management and accidental release prevention programs are functioning properly, the Rodeo Refinery periodically conducts audits to verify that the procedures and practices required by the programs are being implemented as intended.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Management and field personnel participate in the audits in order to verify that practices correspond with written procedures.  The audit team may include employee(s) from other sites and third parties.  The audit team develops findings that are presented to refinery and area management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to audit team findings are tracked"

The following types of devices are used in various processes throughout the refinery to help prevent incidents: relief valves, rupture disks, check valves, excess flow valves, remotely operated valves, flare systems, automatic interlocks and shutdown systems, hydrocarbon detectors, manual block valves, process alarms (level, temperature, flow, pressure), and computer-aided control systems.  Additionally, the following types of features are used in various processes throughout the refinery to help mitigate (reduce the effects of) incidents: sprinkler systems, deluge systems, dikes or containment berms, fixed firewater monitors, and fire fighting foam delivery systems.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan to protect its workers, the public, and the environment.  The program includes procedures for responding to the release of regulated substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address various aspects of emergency response including notification of local emergency response organizations, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation and shelter-in-place plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notifications to regulatory agencies, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  The Rodeo Refinery utilizes the Incident Command System in cooperation with local emergency response personnel.  \n\nThe refinery also has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions and t"

The emergency response program is updated as necessary to reflect changes in refinery processes and suggested improvement.  Training on changes to the plan is given to affected employees.\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains a qualified fire brigade, an oil spill response team, a hazardous materials team, and a rescue team.  Additionally, several refinery employees are certified emergency medical technicians.  Frequent training and participation in emergency response drills ensures the readiness of the response organization.\n\nThe emergency response program for the Rodeo Refinery is coordinated with Contra Costa Health Services, the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District, the Crockett Carquinez Fire Protection District, and the Contra Costa County Office of Emergency Services.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Rodeo Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency responders.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident and facilitating a quick response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nContinuous Improvement: The Rodeo Refinery continuously seeks and evaluates methods to improve the safety of its operations.  Recommendations from audits, incident investigations, process hazard analyses, or employee suggestions provide opportunities to enhance the safety of the refinery.  Improvements in technology provide another opportunity to enhance facility safety.  For example, the refinery discontinued use of gaseous chlorine several years ago when less hazardous substitutes became viable. \n \nYear 2000 (Y2K) Preparedness: Tosco Corporation and the Rodeo Refinery have developed Y2K Task Forces to investigate, develop, and implement plans to minimize any disruption that might occur because of Y"

A toxic worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to be damaged such that it released its entire contents within ten minutes without accounting for response measures that we would take to minimize the impact of such a release.  A flammable worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to suddenly disappear, the contents were to instantaneously vaporize, and a resulting vapor cloud were to ignite and explode.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely event.  It is used to determine a reasonable outer bound for potential impacts in order to coordinate with local emergency responders.  Unlike the worst-case scenarios, our alternate release scenarios are based on actual equipment configurations.  In selecting our alternate release scenarios, we considered our practices and procedures for preventing and minimizing the size of chemical releases.\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Rodeo refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of an aqueous ammonia storage tank.  This material would spill into the tank's secondary containment dike and then evaporate.  The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that releasing the entire contents of one of this tank over a ten-minute period would result in offsite impact.  The ammonia toxic endpoint specified by EPA is 200 ppm (parts per million).\n\nThe alternate release scenario for ammonia is the failure of a delivery truck during ammonia delivery operations.  This scenario assumes the entire contents of the delivery truck would spill and a portion evaporate.  The results of the alternate release scenario for ammonia indicate that such a release would have an offsite impact.\n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario for the Rodeo Refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of our largest butane storage vessel.

In fulfilling this commitment, management will ensure systems are in place to provide the resources and training to identify issues and maintain a safe and healthful environment as indicated by Company standards, accepted safety and environmental practices, and compliance with legislative requirements.  We will operate and maintain our plants, facilities and equipment and handle our raw materials and products in a manner to prevent personal injuries/illnesses, losses to Company property, releases to the environment, or impact to the communities in which we operate.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco San Francisco Area Refinery at Rodeo, located in Rodeo, California, processes crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces gasoline, automotive diesel, butane, fuel oil and petroleum coke.  In order to produce these products, we store and handle large quantities of regulated flammable materials.  In addition, the refinery also uses and stores ammonia above the threshold quantity.\n\nTo reduce air pollution, the Rodeo Refinery power plant is equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction devices that convert oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to harmless nitrogen and water.  These devices use a solution of ammonia in water (aqueous ammonia), a regulated substance, to perform this conversion.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe EPA requires facilities to report on potential worst-case scenarios involving the regulated substances that we handle in amounts exceeding the threshold quantities.  The EPA mandates the release conditions for worst-case scenarios.  As a result, these scenarios ignore prevention programs that are designed to limit the number and size of chemical releases from our"

This information is available to all employees. \n\nChemical specific information, including hazards, protective measures, symptoms, and first aid procedures is provided via Material Safety Data Sheets.  This information is available in hard copy format and via the refinery computer network.\n\nThe limits for key process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, flow, and level) are documented in the unit operating manuals.  The process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nInformation on the design and construction of process equipment includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that protective features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined using a technique known as process hazard analysis, or PHA.  A team of experienced operators, engineers, and other specialists conducts the analyses.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures a"

The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that the instantaneous release and subsequent explosion of the entire contents of the vessel would result in offsite impact.  The toxic endpoint specified by EPA for this type of release is an overpressure of 1 psi.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable materials is a flammable vapor cloud formed by a liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, release.  LPG is a mixture of propane and butane, which are the fuels used in home barbecue grills and disposable cigarette lighters.  The results of dispersion modeling indicate that this cloud would remain flammable as it crosses a public road that is beyond our fenceline.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has experienced two accidental releases since June 1994 that qualify for reporting under the EPA's criteria.\n\nThe first event occurred on September 15, 1994.  This event involved a release of regulated flammables containing small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, which is also a regulated toxic substance.  The released cause offsite odors because of the hydrogen sulfide in the vapors.  These odors affected a nearby school.  There were reports that some of the children sought medical attention as a result of the release.  Investigation of the event revealed that the vapors were vented to the atmosphere through a pressure relief device on a tank following shutdown of a compressor that collects low-pressure vapors from the tank.  As a result of this release and numerous reliability problems with the compressor system, the compressor and its associated instrumentation were upgraded to modern equipment in 1996.\n\nThe second event occurred on April 16, 1997.  This incident involved the release of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, both regulated toxic materials, from the Sulfur Recovery Unit.  As a precaution, local officials"

Investigation of the incident revealed that the event resulted from failure to detect and correct a high-level condition in a process vessel at a processing unit upstream of the Sulfur Recovery Unit.  The vessel overflowed and contaminated the feed to the Sulfur Recovery Unit with hydrocarbons.  These hydrocarbons interfered with the normal process chemistry.  The result was a release of sulfur dioxide and some hydrogen sulfide from the combustor stack.  As a result of the investigation, operators received refresher training on the Sulfur Recovery Unit process chemistry and early detection of upset conditions.  Also, instrumentation at the vessel that overflowed was modified to provide earlier detection of a high-level condition.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following summaries represent numerous prevention programs and practices at the Rodeo Refinery.  Rodeo Refinery employees are committed to operating a safe facility through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these programs and practices.  \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.   Information on the refinery's prevention programs is available to employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  In addition, refinery management has a strong commitment to developing and enforcing written policies and procedures and encourages employee input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experience. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information.
