The City of Edmond Water Resources Edmond Water Resource Recovery Facility utilizes a Safe Work Permit form designed after the OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements found in 29 CFR 1910.252(a).  Personnel who are to perform the Hot Work are required to complete the form which is reviewed by the area supervisor.  The form must be approved before work can proceed.

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Edmond Water Resources Edmond Water Resource Recovery Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Edmond Water Resources Edmond Water Resource Recovery Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenarios (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.
