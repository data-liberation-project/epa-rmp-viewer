      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two most commonly used substances for treating wastewater.  The Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation Plant (CSDWRP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for dechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  CSDWRP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and sulfur dioxide as seriously as it takes in providing the environment safe disinfected water. CSDWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n? Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n? General facility and regulated substances information.\n? Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n? Five-year accident history summary.\n? Emergency response program summary.\n? Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the CSDWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe CSDWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

CSDWRP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with local response agencies, such as the Resources Management Agency, Environmental Health Division, Ventura County. CSDWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation Plant is located on 150 Howard Road in Camarillo, California.  The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 20 acres, bounded by Pleasant Valley Road to the north, Pancho Road to the west and Howard Road to the south.\nThe Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation facility has operated since 1957.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 2.75 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to current capacity of 6.75 mgd. The wastewater treated at Camarillo Sanitary District Water Reclamation Plant originates mainly from approximately 37,000 domestic and industrial users in the City of Camarillo; a small fraction is of agricultural origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with post-chlorination and dechlorination to yield a secondary effluent for purposes of re-use and/or discharge.\n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers and stored inside the chlorine storage room.

The chlorination system consists of twelve one-ton chlorine containers, three evaporators, four chlorinators, one ejector, two residual analyzers, three chlorine detectors, diffusers, chlorine contact basins, piping and other equipment.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present in the chlorine storage room can be as much as 12 tons.  In the case of a major leak, the chlorine gas analyzers are used to sense chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage room. Upon detection of approximately 1 ppmv chlorine, the analyzers will send a signal which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the chlorine gas within the chlorine storage room.  The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nThe purpose of the dechlorination system is to inject sulfur dioxide solution into the plant effluent to dechlorinate the effluent.  This is done to meet the waste discharge requirements of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Region 4, Los Angeles Region.  The sulfur dioxide system consists of eight one-ton sulfur dioxide containers, two evaporators, four sulfonators and four ejectors, diffusers and other piping and equipment, most of which is located in the sulfur dioxide storage room.  Sulfur dioxide is diffused into the effluent channel at the discharge of the chlorine contact basin. The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide present in the sulfur dioxide storage room can be as much as 8 tons.  In the case of a major leak, sulfur dioxide gas analyzers are used to sense the sulfur dioxide leak in the sulfur dioxide storage room.

The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a sulfur dioxide leak.\n\nUpon detection of a 1 ppm chlorine leak or a 10 ppm sulfur dioxide leak, the following process is initiated:  a) the normal ventilation system is shut down in the leak area to contain the gas within the room, b) local visual and audible alarms are actuated, c) remote alarms at the distributed control system operator interface unit located in the control room, and the scrubber control panel are activated, d) the containment valve in the building that does not have the leak is closed, and e) the selected duty caustic recirculation pump is started.  The scrubber is manually shut down when the chlorine or sulfur dioxide concentration reaches 1 ppm.\n\nThe control room at the plant is manned 8 hours a day, year round.  The plant is monitored during the 16 unmanned hours by complete alarm system in communication with a contracted answering service.  If the alarm system is activated, the answering service contacts the stand-by employee who then responds.  Access to the CSDWRP is through gates, which are closed after regular hours.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

The CSDWRP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  The operating procedures include start-up, normal operation, shutdown, and non-standard operating procedures.  Also included are the maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.
