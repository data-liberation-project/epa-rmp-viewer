      "SummaryText": "Cathay Pigments (USA) Inc. is a manufacturer of iron oxides for magnetic storage media, and food and cosmetic grade color pigments.  One of the raw materials used in this process is agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia (anhydrous means without water).  Approximately 80% of all ammonia produced is used in agriculture, as a nitrogen source for plants and a protein source in livestock feeds.  Other common uses for ammonia are: metal treating, pharmaceuticals, synthetic textile fibers, plastics, water treatment, pollution control devices and large refrigeration systems.  Anhydrous Ammonia is classified as a non-flammable gas with a reportable spill quantity of 100 pounds.  Cathay uses detailed operating and maintenance procedures procedures, and employee training to maintain the safe operation of this system.  Detection sensors are strategically located to alert personnel of leaks.  Remotely operated shut off valves, internal tank automatic shutoff valves, and remotely operated water deluge systems minimize the effect of a failed component.  Cathay participates in the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and invites the local Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team to train on site annually.  Our internal emergency response plan includes coordinating with police, fire and HAZMAT personnel.  Cathay has had no reportable releases of, or injuries from ammonia in the last 10 years.  The Management of Cathay is committed to operating this system in a safe and responsible manor, protecting our employees and the surrounding community.  Cathay's Risk Management Plan submission and other related records was inspected by U.S.EPA on 08/22/2002.  In June of 2006 the following mechanical integrity work was completed on the ammonia system; storage tank emptied for internal visual and magnaflux inspection, all system manual valves were rebuilt, liquid and vapor loading lines were replaced with break-away equipment, internal storage tank excess flow valves were rep"
