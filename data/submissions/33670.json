The safety information, hazard review, and operating procedures sections are completed for the chlorine systems. The training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations sections are completed for the plant as a system. The safety information includes material safety data sheets for each chemical, maximum inventories, safe operating limits, equipment specifications, and codes and standards for design. The plant maintains a form specifiying the current safety information used and documents any changes as they occur. The safety form must be updated at least every two years. The hazard review information includes the forms necessary for the reviews that will be performed at least every five years for the different processes. The operating procedures for initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency or normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency or normal shutdown. Forms are provided to document the procedures for the plant, including a chlorine checklist and chlorine change-over form.The training information includes certification that all employes have trained for the processes and equipment that they operate. Documentation is also kept for refresher training that must be provided at least every three years. The maintenance information includes a form to document testing and inspections. The forms also include verification and information documenting the development of the maintenance program for the facility and must be updated at least every two years. The compliance audit information includes the forms necessary"

Incident investigation information includes the forms to be completed upon occurrence of an incident, including the Accident Investigation Report, Chemical Release Form, and Safety Team Report.\n\nThe five-year accident history for the plant includes one incident. The incident involved an ammonia release in 2001 reported as a theft of ammonia from the storage vessel. No one was injured and the City of Longview Fire Department Hazmat Team responded. Our chemical inventory was reduced below threshold level and tamper resistant guards were installed to prevent further incidents.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the response program for incident leaks as handled by plant employees and the program for major spills and/or releases as covered in the City of Longview's Emergency Response Program. The incidental releases include leaks encountered when installing the cylinders for use, dismantling the chlorine cylinders, and any minor release found upon inspection or testing of the equipment. Proper handling equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations. Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance. The plant will contact the City of Longview Fire Department for assistance with chemical releases. The local Hazmat team will then be contacted by the fire department if needed. The First Call emergency contact system is also available for facilities in Gregg County. The fire department will iniate contact with the First Call program for emergency notification assistance.\n\nThe City of Longview Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Material Incidents is identified in detail in the RMP with copies of the forms for emergency notification. These emergency notification forms include: Emergency Public Information Checklist for Hazardous Material Incident, Sample Radio/TV Message for Unidentified Spill/Release"
