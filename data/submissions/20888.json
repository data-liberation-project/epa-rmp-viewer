KMC LLC has prepared a policy stating this and has provided the resources to meet the requirements of these guiding principles.  The programs that have been developed to meet Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program are based on these guiding principles and meet the requirements of the regulations.The Hamilton facility has developed an emergency response plan that has been modified to meet the requirements of Subpart E of RMP.  The emergency response plan is site specific and has been shared with the LEPC.  This facility is an OSHA Star site.\n\nThe products produced at this facility are sodium chlorate, manganese metal, manganese-aluminum briquettes, and titanium dioxide pigment.\n\nChlorine is used in the manufacture of titanium dioxide pigment and in the cooling tower and water treatment systems.\n\nAmmonia is used in the production of manganese metal.\n\nTitanium tetrachloride is used in the production of titanium dioxide pigment.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the production of manganese metal.\n\nPropane is used in the oxidation process to generate the heat of reaction when major raw materials (titanium tetrachloride and oxygen) are reacted in the oxidizer.\n\nThe facility has prepared a worst case scenario for chlorine and alternative case scenarios for ammonia, sulfur dioxide, titanium tetrachloride and chlorine.  The facility also prepared a worst case scenario for propane.\n\nAs required by RMP, the toxic worst case scenario involves emptying a vessel containing 180,000 pounds of chlorine over a period of 10 minutes under meterological conditions of 105 F and 73% relative humidity at night.  The model predicted the chlorine would reach the endpoint concentration after traveling 4.4 miles. \n\nAlternative release scenarios for each toxic substance were performed.  The alternative case scenario for chlorine depicts a tubing leak allowing 326 pounds of chlorine to be relea"

      "SummaryText": "sed.  More typical atmospheric conditions were allowed to be considered and the model predicted the endpoint concentration to be reached after the chlorine traveled 0.42 miles.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for sulfur dioxide and ammonia assumed a pipe break and release.\n\nSulfur dioxide reached an endpoint concentration at 1.0 mile. \n\nAmmonia was modeled to  reach an endpoint concentration after traveling 0.32 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenerio for Titanium tetrachloride was assumed to consist of the release of the contents of 2 selas pre heaters.  This scenerio was modeled with EPA RMP* COMP and it indicated that an endpoint concentration would be reached at 0.9 miles.\n\nThe model for the flammable worst case scenario for propane was modeled  assuming that the contents of a tank would be released and would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The EPA RMP*COMP model was uses to model this scenario.  The distance to  1 psi overpressure is predicted to extend to 0.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for propane was assumed to consist of a 17,000 pound release and also resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to 1 psi overpressure predicted by the EPA RMP*COMP model also modeled with EPARMP*COMP  0.2 miles.\n\nThe facility has taken numerous steps to prevent releases from its operations.  Some of these include installation of pressure relief valves and excess flow valves on storage tanks.  Water deluge systems and diking of tanks and vessels have been utilized.  Standard operation procedures and job safety and environmental analyses have been developed for handling these substances at the facility.\n\nThe facility has implemented prevention programs that meet the requirements of OSHA PSM, EPA RMP(program 3), and CMA Responsible Care.\n\nThere have been two releases that resulted in injuries during the past five years.  On 7/23/97, while an employee was cleaning the down leg on a cyclone, he struck the line with a hammer dislodging a pluggage. He was exposed to"

There was no off site impact and this release did not exceed the reportable quantity.\n\nOn 12/18/96, 21 pounds of chlorine was released from a separator sump when the dump valves failed in the open position allowing an employee to be exposed to chlorine and experience difficulty in breathing.  There was no off site impact.\n\nFacility employees are trained to respond to an emergency as described in the emergency response plan.  Employees are trained in the use of the necessary personal protective equipment needed to respond to releases of all of the substances at the facility.\n\nThere is a continual program of improvement through the ISO 14000 program to help prevent releases from the facility."
