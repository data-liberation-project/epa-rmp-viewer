We sell and distribute grocery, frozen, perishable food and other related items to grocery stores and other retail locations. The refrigeration system in the warehouse's perishable and frozen food departments contains 44,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in holding tanks and associated piping, valves, compressors and other apparatus. There are no other covered processes at the warehouse that involve regulated substances in amounts that exceed the designated threshold qauntities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  This facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29CFR 1910.119) as it applies to our refrigeration system and it is our policy to adhere to all other applicable federal, state and local laws. In the unlikely event an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia occurs, it is our policy to activate the Company Emergency Response Plan and coordinate with and assist the Hickory Fire Department's Hazmat Team and Caldwell County's Emergency Management System in responding to the emergency.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario/Alternate Release Scenario:  Ourworst-case release scenario involves the total failure of the warehouse's refrigeration and associated spill prevention systems allowing the release of 44,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off site and public receptors would be within the distance to the endpoint. However, the design features of the refrigeration system and associated spill prevention sustems and the facility's operating procedures make such a total failure extremely unlikely. Our alternative release scenario is a break in a refrigeration pipe that would lead to a 10-minute releaseof gas/vapor. In this scenario, the resulting distance to the endpoint does not extend off-site and there would be no public receptors within th"

The anhydrous ammonia based refrigeration system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, other applicable federal, state and local laws, and generally accepted engineering practices. The facility's employees involved withthe anhydrous ammonia system have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out duties and responsiblities specified in the facility's operating procedures and recieve periodic refresher training as required by the applicable regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  We have never had an accident or incident involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the unlikely event an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia occurs, it is our policy to activate the Company Emergency Response Plan and coordinate with and assist the Hickory Fire Department's Hazmat team and Caldwell County's Emergency Management System in responding to the emergency. Our personnel have had discussion and trained with these response agencies to familiarize them with the warehouse's refrigeration system and the Company Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:  None"
