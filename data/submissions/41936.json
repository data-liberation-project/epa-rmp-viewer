      "SummaryText": "1. The Exel Inc facility was built for Hormel Foods to use as a distribution center for most of the 50 states and export.\n2. Exel Inc. is a 235,000 sq.ft. cold storage warehouse. The refrigeration system is run by Logic Tech installed computer system. The system can run on auto or controlled manually. Operating temperature is from 35f to -30f. We have a back-up generator in case of lost power that supplies power to computers, emergency lights, and safety equipment.\n3. The offsite consequences analysis includes condisideration of two ammonia release senarios, worst case and alternate. This is defined by EPA which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over 10 minutes due to failure. The alternative is more likely to occur than the worst case. Emergency response planning was done and figured by RMP COMP 1.05f to get our distance to end point of .8 miles on worst case. The alternate release senario is agasket leaking on one of the valve stations on the roof. Using RMP COMP 1.05f we end with .1 miles to end point. We have state of the art ammonia system with ammonia dectors,sprinkler system, strobe lights,and horn."
