The Greeley 23rd Ave. Treated Water Storage \nFacility Emergency Response Policy involves utilization of, and coordination with, offsite responders to address potential chlorine-related incidents.\n\nb.\tThe 23rd Ave. Treated Water Storage Facility serves the customers in Greeley, Colorado.  The facility stores 67 million gallons of treated water that is delivered to the facility from our two water treatment plants.The facility adds chlorine to the treated water that it stores to maintain adequate residual disinfection action as the water is distributed to the customer.   The distribution/disinfection building consists of three rooms.  One room contains two vacuum type chlorinators and vacuum piping that extend into a second \troom which contains two one-ton chlorine containers, scales, hoists, and tools required\n\tfor the process.  The third room contains the electrical panels, flow recorders, chlorine \n\talarm and various safety equipment. The chlorine container room and chlorinator room\n\thave piping which connects to a chlorine scrubber.  The facility is normally staffed from\n\t7:30-4:30 Monday thru Friday.  Operators who have been trained and certified in the \toperation and maintenance of the chlorination equipment  are on call 24 hours a day, \tseven \tdays a week,  and will respond to any alarms which may occur. The alarm system \tactivates  an alarm on the system computer that is operated by a Win-911 system \twhich \tnotifies pertinent personnel, and also the City Police and Fire Dispatch Office. Only \tincidental (known and immediately controllable) events are handled by facility \tstaff.  \tAll other emergency events are responded to by the city's Hazmat Team. \n\nc.\tThe offsite consequence analyses includes the consideration of two chlor"

The \tfirst scenario is defined by the United States Enviornmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") \twhich states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the  . . . maximum \t\tquantity in the largest vessel . . . is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an \t\tunspecified failure.  The alternate scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than \tthe worst-case release scenario.\"\n\n\tThe worst-case scenario must assume the catastrophic release over ten minutes of the \tentire contents of a full one-ton container of chlorine, certain specified atmospheric \tconditions and the failure of all active mitigation systems. As permitted by the guidance, \tthe facility assumed that the chlorination building would provide a degree of passive \tmitigation by slowing the release of chlorine gas to the atmosphere. Applying the \tguidance, and assuming an obstructed urban landscape, the facility determined that the \tdefined worst-case release scenario would have an off-site toxic endpoint of .9 miles. \n\t(The toxic endpoint is identified as the maxium airborne concentration below which it is\n\tbelieved that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without \texperiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which \tcould impair an individual's ability to take protective action.)\n\n\tA number of potential alternate release scenarios were considered, and determined to \thave no reasonable potential to result in an off-site toxic endpoint. The scenario \tconsidered most relevant was the rupture of the flexible connection (pigtail) to a one-ton container. \n\tIn this case, the rupture of the 5/16 inch connector tubing would result in a chlorine\n\trelease of 15 lbs. per minute.  \n\tThe one-ton chlorine containers are stored in a cinder block and brick building.\n\tThe building is equipped with a chlorine detector that will trigger an alarm at\n\tconcentrations"
