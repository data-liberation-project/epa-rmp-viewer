This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Berne Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\nexpertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with one 12,000-gallon tank, five 1,500-\ngallon nurse tanks, six 1,250-gallon nurse tanks, and thirty-eight 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our\nfacility in Berne, Indiana (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 70,550 gallons (363,050.3\npounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\nfacility (the 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with the 12,000-gallon tank) contains 131,223 pounds\nat 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n  4.

In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nHelena Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the\nlast 5 years.  Despite our stringent release prevention policies, a small accidental release occurred\non May 6, 2004.  Due to a valve failure, 300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released, resulting\nin a 20-minute cloud.  The valve was replaced immediately, and an incident report was filed.  There\nwere no deaths or injuries as a result of the incident.  No property damage or environmental damage\noccurred, and evacuation was not necessary.\n\n  6.
