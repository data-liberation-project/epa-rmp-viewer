The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures.  Employees are trained in the procedures and use the equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coodinated with the local emergency responsers such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.
