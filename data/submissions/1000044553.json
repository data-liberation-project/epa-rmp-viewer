The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP)is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe City of Redding operates two wastewater treatment plants: Clear Creek and Stillwater.  Its Clear Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 2220 Metz Road, Anderson, CA in Shasta County, and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located on the west bank of the Sacramento River in an industrial area just south of Redding.  There are 11 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored inside an enclosed building that is dedicated to chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wast"

Pressurized gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or sulfonators located in a separate room.  For chlorine, the gas is drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector inside the dedicated building.  In the case of sulfur dioxide, the gas under partial vacuum travels undergorund in PVC piping to the outfall building where it is injected into water and then added to the outfall pipe shortly before the final effluent is discharged into the Sacramento River.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the City of Redding that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Redding has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Redding are"

City of Redding has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection and dechlorination process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City of Redding's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, enclosing the chlorine and sulfur dioxide building, improving the seismic restraint of ton containers and container scales, and adding a dry media neutralization (scrubber) to remove accidentally release gas into the building before it can lead to an atmospheric release.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe City of Redding's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Redding Fire Department and the Shasta Cascade Hazardous Materials Response Team (SCHMRT).
