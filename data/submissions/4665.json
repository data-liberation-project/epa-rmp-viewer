The stationary source is a 13,000 gallon above ground storage tank which holds a maximum of 8,000 gallons of the regulated substance Hydrochloric Acid at a solution of 37 percent.  Hydrochloric acid is a regulated substance due to its nature as a toxic substance.  The worst case release scenario simulates the release of 66,669 pounds of Hyrdrochloric Acid in a containment area with a resultant release of 5.78 pounds per minute as a toxic vapor.  Ultilizing The EPA simulation model RMP*Comp, the estimated toxic endpoint is 0.5 miles from the stationary source for the worst case scenario. The alternate release scenario simulates the faliure of the pipe line and the release of all the Hydrochoric Acid over approximately 100 minutes. The toxic endpoint for the alternate release is 0.2 miles.  The  public receptors within the radius of the toxic endpoints for both the worst case and alternate case scenarios include an industrial park located adjacent to the facility. There is a  recreation area located approximately 0.3 miles of the site. The total  residential population within 0.5 miles is estimated to be less than 250 people.  The general accidental release prevention program for the Tokusen, USA facility includes secondary containment, employee training, shutoff valves and pressure release vents with scrubbers.  There has not been a reportable accidental release of Hydrochloric Acid since the plant opened operations in 1992.  The Emgerency Response Plan is coordinated with the Arkansas Office of Emgerency Response, the Conway Fire Department, and Emgerency Health Care Professoinals.  Tokusen updated its Emergency Responce Plan to reflect recent organizational changes effective April 1, 1999."
