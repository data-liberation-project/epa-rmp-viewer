Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies:\nWe at Holten Meats are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate our emergency response services.\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements is 11,500 pounds.\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\nProcess Safety Information:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-if Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard are addressed in a timely manner.\nOpera"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdowns, and startup after a turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operations involved in the process.\nTraining\nHolten Meats has a comprehensive training programming place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity:\nHolten Meats carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at Holten Meats to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\nPre-startup Reviews:\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Holten Meats.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipmen"
