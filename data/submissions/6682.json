First, Honda's Safety Policy expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- provide a safe and healthful working environment,\n- conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety,\n- continually improve the safety management system, \n- train associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\n- comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by \nfederal, state, and local law.\n\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy which \nexpresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, \nand local law,\n- operate and continually improve an environmental management system, and \n- implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce \nwaste.\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda's Anna Engine Plant (Honda/AEP) has made \na significant effort to ensure compliance and good management in all areas relating to \nchemical safety.  Many of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements are similar or \nidentical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the two Honda processes \nsubject to RMP regulation are already subject to PSM requirements.

The finished cores are removed from the \ncore box and inspected prior to their use in the disk manufacturing process.   \n\nFor sulfur dioxide, the hypothetical worst-case release scenario was modeled \nusing an F atmospheric stability class based on a 10-minute instantaneous \nrelease from one of the sulfur dioxide storage vessels in the containment room.    \n\nThe alternative release scenario conducted for sulfur dioxide analyzed the \nhypothetical release of sulfur dioxide, as a gas, through a break in the line \nconnecting two tanks in the containment room.  The model used the D \natmospheric stability class. \n\n2.    Anhydrous Ammonia:\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia (metallurgical grade) is stored in an 18,000 gallon- \ncapacity tank.  The ammonia is pumped to the nitriding furnace through a series \nof immersion heaters where the liquid is vaporized into a gas.  Through overhead \npiping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand and a flowmeter \nstand prior to being introduced into the nitriding furnace.  \n\nDue to the high temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit) the ammonia dissociates \ninto its components according to the following reaction:\n\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia ? 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\n\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides.  \nThe nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will \nminimize wear and fatigue.  The remaining component, Hydrogen, (3H2) is \nburned off by the afterburner.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rules and instructions, because the hypothetical \nworst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia was estimated to affect a \nsmaller number of public receptors than the hypothetical worst case release \nscenario for sulfur dioxide, the worst case release scenario for anhydrous \nammonia is not being reported in the RMP. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia analyzed the h"

The model used the D atmospheric stability class. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention \nSteps at AEP:\n\nIn addition to being subject to the RMP requirements, Honda/AEP is subject to and \ncomplies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard to prevent \naccidental chemical releases from the disc core making process and the operation of the \nnitriding furnace.  Honda/AEP surpasses the requirements of various elements of the \nstandard, including response training, mechanical integrity and chemical-monitoring \ndevices to maintain high levels of compliance and prevent accidental releases.  \nMonitoring systems have built-in back up systems to insure fail-safe operation/detection \nand therefore are highly reliable.  The plant also exceeds training requirements and has \nappropriate material/equipment to control or stabilize process leaks and releases.  The \nAEP emergency response team conducts intensive annual training regarding chemical \nspecific response scenarios and maintains chemical specific response equipment.  As a \nresult, no significant accidental releases have occurred over the life of the various \nprocesses regulated by the PSM standard.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, there have been two small releases of sulfur dioxide from both the \ntank storage area and the process area.  These releases resulted in minor injuries to \nassociates in the area of the process but did not result in any damage to on site property \nnor did these releases result in any damage, injury, or other known impacts offsite.  In the \nsame five-year period, there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nHonda of America Mfg., Inc., has developed a company wide Emergency Response Plan \n(ERP), which explains Hondas commitment to emergency response.

This company wide plan acts as a guideline for the Honda/AEP \nemergency response team to develop a plant specific ERP.  This plan in turn outlines how \nthe Honda/AEP emergency response team is to work closely with the Anna Fire \nDepartment, the Shelby County Hazmat Team, and the Emergency Management Agency \nto execute a smooth stop to any emergency.\n\nThe Honda/AEP Emergency Response Team (ERT) meets annually with the Village of \nAnna Fire Chief and members of its response team to review operations at the plant.  This \nmeeting also includes an in-depth tour of the plant that includes inspection of sumps, \nhydraulic pump pits and a thorough inspection of the roof.  In addition, during last \nOctober and November, the Honda/AEP ERT took part in a joint 36 hour training session \nwith the Village of Anna Fire Department to train new members of the respective teams.  \nThe City of Sidney Fire Department conducted the training.\n\nThe Anna Engine Plant Emergency Response Team is currently made up of 12 to 15 \nassociates on each of the three production shifts.  The members are volunteers who work \nfull-time in their respective production departments.  There are 3 full-time emergency \nresponse staff members, one for each shift, with one (on a rotating basis) on call 24 hours \na day, who are responsible for leadership and coordination of team members.  Each \nemergency response team member must meet Fire Fighter Level I state requirements as \ndefined in section 1001 of the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) manual and \nmust attend quarterly training classes and drills.  Training is taught on-site by an outside \ntraining contractor in accordance with NFPA, section 600 requirements.

If plant security, which covers the plant switchboard 24 \nhours a day, receives an emergency call, they are trained to activate the alarm system and \nalert the emergency response pagers.

Public notification of a release will be handled jointly by the Shelby \nCounty LEPC and Sheriffs Office.  The AEP Emergency Response Plan is reviewed \nannually with the local Emergency Management Agency (EMA), the Village of Anna \nFire Department, the Shelby County LEPC, and the Shelby County Sheriffs Office.\n\nPlanned Improvements to Improve Safety:\n\nIn order to greatly minimize the possibility of a worst case release from its anhydrous \nammonia storage tank, Honda has placed this tank in an isolated fencedoff area subject \nto restricted entry, thereby limiting the types and amounts of physical activities taking \nplace at or near the tank. \n\nIn addition to the preventive steps listed above, Honda/AEP is currently investigating \nalternative manufacturing techniques that could reduce or eliminate within the next two \nyears the use of Sulfur Dioxide. This potential process modification would eliminate one \nof two AEP processes that are currently regulated by the PSM standard.\n \n\n  Honda/AEP notes that the nitriding furnace also utilizes propane as both a fuel and chemical agent.  \nHowever, in light of the April 27th ruling issued by U.
