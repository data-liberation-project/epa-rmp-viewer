This company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place. Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOur plant consists of 2 ammonia storage tanks  and when filled to 85% capacity will hold approximately 118,530 pounds. With the addition of 10- 1000 gallon nurse tanks with a capacity of  43775 pounds makes the company's total capacity 163,000 pounds.\n\nThe worse case scenario may potentially release 66,000 pounds (over a ten minute period) and has a distance to end point of 1.76 miles. This release has the potential to affect 2200 area residents. The alternative release scenario would have a release of 11,908 pounds over a 2 minute period. This release would have a distance to endpoint of .83 miles and would still effect 800 people within the community. \n\nThis company maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all federal, state, and local authorities. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement. Those changes or improvements will be acted upon immediately to reduce potential ammonia releases. Our employees are trained in safety procedures, proper plant operations, plant maintenance, and the employees are tested competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of safety water during nurse tank loading operations.\n\nWith the above mentioned training in mind, it makes it very simple to report to you that absoluelty no injury accidents or property damage have occured or property damage have occured at this facility for the past five years. \n\nOur emergency action plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees"
