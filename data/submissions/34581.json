The CalARP statue is Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and those regulations found in Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Chapter 4.5 beginning with 2735.1 through 2785.1. The local administering agency (AA) oversees the development of the RMP.The scope of this RMP is based on discussions with the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the City of El Segundo Fire Department, to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  The aqueous ammonium process is the only chemical that triggers the RMP/CalARP requirements as previously agreed to by the CUPA. In the initial RMP submittal it was determined that this process was covered by Program 2 requirements.  \nEl Segundo Generating Station, located in El Segundo, California, is an electric generating station consisting of two operating units, Units 3 and 4 each rated at 335 megawatts (MW).  These units are capable of combusting either fuel oil or natural gas.  SCR technology was installed on Unit 4 in 1994 and in June  2001 on Unit 3 to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The initial RMP was updated in September of 2001 to incorporate changes related to the addition of the Unit 3 SCR system.\nSCR is a post-combustion flue-gas NOX emission control technology that removes NOX from the flue ga"

The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia to be stored on site will be 20,000 gallons, in one underground storage tank.\n1.5 Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at El Segundo Generating Station in the past 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage  (Statute:  40 CFR 68.42).\n1.6 Emergency Response Program\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan for the El Segundo Generating Station include the following:\n\u00b7Specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia\n\u00b7Procedures to notify local and public agencies including the El Segundo Fire Department, the Office of Emergency Services, and the National Response Center \n\u00b7A list of resources for emergency health care\n\u00b7Information regarding the training of employees on responses to releases\n\u00b7A list of other federal and state requirements the facility is subject\n1.7 Planned Safety Improvement Changes\nThe What-if revalidation Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) and the seismic evaluation for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at El Segundo Generating Station, conducted as part of the 5-year update of the RMP, resulted in recommendations to improve the system\u00bfs safety.  The following findings and recommendations have been or will soon be implemented:\n\u00b7 Corroded or missing pipe supports have been replaced or added.\n\u00b7 A procedure or design change to detect leakage of the 3/4-inch pipe that supplies the chemical treatment system will be provided.\n\u00b7 Procedural and/or design changes to improve operating reliability of the ammonia vapor scrubber used during aqueous ammonia system maintenance will be implemented.\n\u00b7 Based on the human factors analys"

A reducing agent is used to reduce NOX emissions, primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst.  The most common reducing agent (reagent) used with SCR is ammonia.  Injection of ammonia into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream from the stack.  In order to minimize the handling of hazardous materials, the El Segundo Generating Station will use ammonia in the form of aqueous ammonia as the reagent for the SCR reactions. \nThe SCR system in use at the El Segundo Generating Station employs ammonia injection to reduce NOx emissions approximately 80 percent from uncontrolled levels.  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The aqueous ammonia used is 29.4 weight percent of ammonia in water, [Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7664-41-7].\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at El Segundo Generating Station is made up of a single underground storage tank, pumps, and piping that terminates at the aqueous ammonia vaporizer skid where the aqueous ammonia is atomized.  The underground storage tank is double-walled with a capacity of 20,000 gallons.  It is equipped with pressure relief valves, leak detectors, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank is filled via a vendor\u00bfs 6,000-gallon tanker truck with deliveries scheduled at regular intervals based upon ammonia consumption.  The aqueous ammonia is pumped through aboveground and belowground 2-inch pipe to the aqueous ammonia vaporizer skids for Boiler Units 3 and 4. Other aqueous ammonia piping include a  3/4-inch line to the chemical treatment system and a 2-inch line that is plugged and seal welded.\nAll other regulated substances on site are in quanti"

An offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed and considered for the implementation of the accident prevention program and the emergency planning. All activities are conducted in accordance with a detailed, Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Management Plan, standard operating procedures, and active participation by management, line and contractor employees.\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00b7Effective preventive maintenance program\n\u00b7Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\u00b7Use of accurate and effective operating procedures \n\u00b7Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures conducted by those famaliar with the operations and maintenance of the El Segundo Generating Station.\n\u00b7Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\nOther specific steps to prevent accidental ammonia releases include the following:\n\u00b7The annual training of the operators in the safe handling of aqueous ammonia, with emphasis on the hazardous and toxic properties of the chemical\n\u00b7The monitoring of tank liquid levels alarm, pressure levels alarm, pressure/vacuum relief valves, and ammonia gas detectors around the storage area\n\n1.4 Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activity of the El Segundo Generating Station is generation of electric power.
