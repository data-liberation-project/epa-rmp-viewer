The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release of natural gasoline and to minimize the potential impact to ADMA?s employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating response activities with local emergency responders.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled:\nADM Corn Processing at Walhalla is located on 111 acres approximately 1.5 miles east of the city of Walhalla, ND.  The primary activity of the facility is processing corn to manufacture fuel ethanol and distillerA?s grain.\n\nIn this Risk Management Plan (RMP), ADM has included a program for its denaturant used in the production of fuel ethanol.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) used at the facilities generally has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of less than 4 and is exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2).  However, due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, it is possible that ADM will receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has the RMP for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.  The regulated substances found in natural gasoline are n-pentane & isopentane. \n\nThe main components of the natural gasoline system are a truck unloading station, an unloading pump, two storage tanks, a transfer pump and associated valves and piping.  Natural gasoline is received by truck only.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program an"

Prevention steps specific to the natural gasoline system are operating procedures, alarm and interlock system to prevent overfilling the tanks, and periodic verification of the tank level indications and overfill protection system.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nThe facility had no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel and the Pembina County Emergency Planning Committee so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nADM will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the Walhalla facility.\n"
