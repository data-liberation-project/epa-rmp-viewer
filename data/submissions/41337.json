      "SummaryText": "I.  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nWhiting Oil and Gas Corporation?s West Branch Gas Plant (WBGP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation?s policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nII.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWest Branch Gas Plant, located in West Branch, Ogemaw County, Michigan, operates processes to remove liquids from natural gas.  The plant has a single regulated flammable mixture, which contains ethane, methane, butane, propane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances.\n\nIII.  General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n Because the WBGP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses a sampling of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n? Employee Participation: The WBGP ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of process safety management and accident prevention. \n\n? Process Safety Information: The WBGP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n? Training:  To complement the written procedures for process operations, the WBGP "

      "SummaryText": "has implemented a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program, is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process. \n\n? Contractors:  The WBGP uses skilled contractors that are supervised by agents of the company that have appropriate training to assure the work they are overseeing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety of company and contract personnel and the general public.  \n\n? Safe Work Practices:  The WBGP has long standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. \n\nThe processes at the WBGP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The WBGP has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The WBGP uses release detection systems such as flame detectors, and release mitigation measures such as dikes to contain liquid releases.\n\nIV.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe WBGP has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nV.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe WBGP has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance potentially resulting form a fire or explosion, severe weather, environmental spill, and pipe line failure.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident cleanup, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The emergency response progra"

      "SummaryText": "m is updated when necessary based on factors such as modification made to the plant process or operating procedures, or change in the communication procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program for the WBGP is coordinated with the Ogemaw County local emergency planning committee (LEPC), which consists of local emergency response officials, state and local government officials, and industry representatives.  The WBGP has around-the-clock communication capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The West Branch Fire Department is given an annual guided tour of the facility to stay familiar with it.\n\nVI.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll findings from the June 2004 PHA and Safety Audit have been scheduled for resolution.  The WBGP will continue to conduct PHAs, safety audits, and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety."
