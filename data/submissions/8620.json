The program covers anhydrous ammonia (ammonia). Ammonia is utilized at the Diamond Walnut facility as a refrigerant.  This regulated hazardous substance is present in the facility above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantities of 500 lbs.  Diamond Walnut has approximately 11,000 lbs of ammonia on site.\n\nThe Diamond Walnut RMP document has been prepared in accordance with CalARP Emergency Regulations and with local requirements prescribed by San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services.  The document includes offsite consequence analysis for release scenarios, a discussion of receptor populations, and the facility's 5-year accident history, the accidental release prevention program, the emergency response program and the program certification.\n\nDiamond Walnut has addressed the Program 3 elements in preparing the CalARP program for their facility.  \n\nWorst case and alternative case (probable) accidental releases for ammonia and methyl bromide were assessed and modeled.  The scenarios are:\n\nAmmonia Worst Case:  Release of Largest Vessel Over a 10-Minute Period\n\nAmmonia Probable Case:  Damage to Valve Packing or Flange Gaskets\n\nDiamond Walnut has developed a schedule for implementing measures to prevent and mitigate the effects and limit the distances for the reported scenarios.  The risk reduction measures include developing additional written procedures, employee training programs, and evaluating potential engineering controls and system modifications.\n\nThe Diamond Walnut facility had only two accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  Neither incident involved reportable quantities, injuries, or environmental or property damage.\n\nDiamond Walnut has a written Emergency Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken by facility employees in response to accidental releases of"
