      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n     The DuPont Victoria Plant adheres to Corporate policies, which could be summarized as follows:\n- All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable.\n- The Goal is Zero - Zero Incidents, Period.\n- All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety.\n\n     The Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous SHE and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At the Victoria Plant, the policies are implemented through the Victoria Plant Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) Manual.  This manual is available to all employees through hard copies or the plantwide Active Learner computer system.  The 800 series of procedures in particular deals with the Process Safety Management Requirements.  In addition, the Victoria Plant Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n     The DuPont Victoria Plant consists of 4500 acres, located approximately 9 miles south of the city of Victoria, in a rural setting south of SH 185.  About 1000 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 100 acres for bio-treatment and wetlands, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.\n\n     The site consists of 2 manufacturing processes:  \n*  Nylon Intermediates (hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid, and dodecanedioic acid).\n*  Ethylene Copolymers (low-density Polyethylene resins).\n\n     In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials or intermediates (except for minor transfer of ethylene waste streams to another on-site company):\n- Anhydrous Ammonia\n- Aqueous Ammonia\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n- Vinyl Acetate monomer (VA)\n- 1,3 Butadiene\n- Ethylene\n- Propane\n- Propylene\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     The worst-case release scenario for a toxic chemical is failure of an anhydrous ammonia storage tank,  with no mitigation assumed.

This release is unlikely due to the double-wall construction and high-integrity design of the tank and associated equipment.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     The worst-case release scenario for a flammable chemical is failure of a butadiene storage sphere, with no mitigation assumed.  This release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  The ignition of this release is unlikely because the contents would be retained within a diked area and because the spheres are located in a remote location versus normal ignition sources.  A sphere failure is unlikely due to the high-integrity design and 100% X-raying of all welds during construction.\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n*  Anhydrous ammonia - A pipe leak in the Anhydrous Ammonia transfer piping was assumed, with a 60 minute duration because of the possibly remote location.  These areas are generally not diked, so no mitigation was assumed.  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance and the Landview program census data.\n\n*  Aqueous ammonia (20% concentration) - A pipe leak in the Aqueous Ammonia transfer piping was assumed.  Per the OCA Guidance for water solutions, a 10 minute release duration was assumed (since the bulk of the toxic will leave the water solution within that time).  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance and the Landview program census data.\n\n*  Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN) - A pipe leak in the piping associated with the distillation system was assumed.  Because of the highly toxic nature of the material, a release duration of 60 minutes was assumed.  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance and t"
