      "SummaryText": "Fremont Beef Company was built in 1989 with production starting in early 1990.  Our facility uses ammonia for our refrigeration system and propane for our back up heating in the winter.  The facility is approximately 80000 square feet. Our ammonia and propane are both stored outside of the building at the northeast corner of our lot.  Our onsite ammonia storage is 18,000 pounds. Our on sight propane storage is 10100 pounds.  Our primary operating function is the refrigeration of our processed beef products.  There are 6 refrigeration compressors.  There are 2 high side compressors, 2 swing compressors and 2 low side compressors.  The ammonia is stored in 5 separate tanks.  They consist of 1 receiver tank rated at 1000 gallons, 2 high side accumulator tanks that store approximately 400 gallons each and 2 low temp accumulators that store approximately 400 gallons each.  All of our refrigeration piping and valve stations are on the roof.   The propane is stored in 3 individual 1000 gallon water capacity storage tanks.  The tanks are all piped together and feed 1 explosion proof supply pump that feeds our propane mixer.  The mixer supplies our boiler and roof top heating units.  This propane set up is for standby fuel usage only.  This system has been used three times in the 19 years the company has been open.  An annual check and start up are done to insure proper operation.  Training and qualifications of our refrigeration technicians ensures that necessary checks on the refrigeration system are performed Any special needs such as oil changes, pressure relief valve changes, filter changes, drain  changes, drain oil pots etc are addressed in our maintenance PM program.  The release scenario is as follows.  The 1000 gallon ammonia receiver was stuck by lightning.  This caused a welded seam to split.  The crack is 1 foot long and A? inch across.  High pressure liquid escapes at a rate of 450 pounds per minute for a total time of ten minutes.  The wind speed is 1.5m/sec. "

      "SummaryText": " The distance to end point is .85 miles.  Approximate number of residents in the affected area is 2000.  The emergency procedures for Fremont Beef are to call 911 and to evacuate all employees to an area that is upwind of the chemical release.  All proper authorities will be notified of the leak and an assessment will be made to find out what the cause of the leak was and estimated amount of the loss.  An effort should be made to evaluate all health and safety issues related to the incident and any long term problems or medical surveillance that must occur because of the incident.  All information that is collected and reviewed should then be evaluated to identify areas for improvement; formation and training of an in house emergency response team, preplanning and prevention activities.  There have been no chemical releases in the history of plant operations.  Our prevention policy is to provide proper maintenance for the refrigeration and the propane system to insure that they are not only in good operating order but they are in a safe working order also.  We are always on the look out for new technology that will not only help us run more efficiently, but will also help us have tighter control on any process variable that could pose a problem.  "
