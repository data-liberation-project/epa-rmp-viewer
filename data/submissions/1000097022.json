Operating and maintenance personnel affected by changes are made aware of the changes and trained as needed.\r\n\r\nPre-Start Up Safety Reviews\r\nThese reviews are conducted for initial startups and following modifications.  The reviews confirm that construction, equipment and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing the equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nAudits will be conducted to ensure that the provisions of PSM and RMP are being implemented.  Any necessary corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nFacility personnel promptly investigate any incident that has or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The investigations seek to identify root causes and any corrective actions necessary to prevent recurrences.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe facility occasionally uses outside contractors to perform specialized maintenance or construction activities.  Hazards that could be encountered related to the covered process are reviewed as well as site-specific safety rules and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe affected process at the facility is equipped with various process controls and mitigation systems such as relief valves, check valves, automatic shutoffs, alarms, etc. and maintains operating procedures to decrease the potential for a release event. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no signific"
