The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Braun Agriservice, Inc. (the facility) are \ncommitted to the prevention of any  accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities,\nto mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\nfarmers.\n\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for\nblending into mixed -grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 102,000 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon storage \ntanks. \n\n3. The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\ntank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds, which\nrepresents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.\nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.5 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of\ndispersion to 200 PPM) is .47 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \u0013Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling  of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u0014, published by The American National Standards Institute,\nInc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CRF\n1910.111, \u0013Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\u0014.\n\n5. The Five-year History\n\nThere ha"

The emergency response program.\n\n-The facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n information as required under SARA Title III (ESCRA).\n\nc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,    including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going prices at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia \nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time."
