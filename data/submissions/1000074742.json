Five Year Accident History - We have not had any accidential releases in the last five years using\none ton chlorine cyclinders.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program - Our Emergency Response Program is to utilize an on-site chlorine\nscrubber which is activated when chlorine gas is detected.  The scrubber has the ablitiy to consume\na one ton chlorine cylinder within 25 minutes.  Water Treatment Staff is also trained and ready to respond\nto a chlorine leak.  In the event of a leak the Water Treatment Staff would activate the Emergency Plan, which includes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division.  Norfolk Fire Division would activate the Local Emergency Operations Plan (LEOP) and notifies any affected neighbors.  Norfolk Fire Division is also a member of the Elkhorn Valley LEPC, which assists with contacting Chem Trec, and other agencies that initiates response from a HAZMAT Team.\n\n6.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety - We will keep up with the latest technology for safe chlorine use \nand update procedures as needed.\n\n7.  The population includes a trailor court with approximately 10 residents and a grade school with an \napproximate enrollment of 75, 5 businesses with approximately 40 employees."

This includes the West Water Treatment Plant located at 300 South 49th Street and the \nEast Water Treatment Plant located at 111 South 1st Street.\n\n1. Accidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy - Water Staff is trained on safe \nchlorine operating and handling procedures.  Staff also performs monthly preventive maintenance and \nchecks on the chlorination, chlorine scrubber, and leak detection systems.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division, which activates the Local Emergency Operations Plan (LEOP) and notifies any potential neighbors.  Norfolk Fire Division is a member of the Elkhorn Valley LEPC.\n\n2. Regulated Substances - The West Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant.  We have\ntwo (2) one ton chlorine cylinders on line at all times.  We could have as many as two (2) additional one\nton cylinders on hand at any given time for a total of four (4) one ton cylinders on site.\n\n3.   A) Worst Case Scenario - A possible broken cylinder valve on a one ton chlorine cyclinder will release \nchlorine gas.  Chlorine gas can travel a distance of 1.3 miles.  If this type of leakage would occur, we \nwould activate the Emergency Response Team to protect the residents in the affected area.  Next step,\nwe would notify Chem Trec Response Team.\n\n      B) Alternative  Release Scenario - A leaking lead gasket that seals an attached line onto the regulator\ncould possibly release a chlorine vapor cloud at a rate of 15 lbs. Per minute.  This cloud could travel a \ndistance of 0.10 miles.  The chlorine cylinders are stored inside a concrete building and are monitored \nby a chlorine gas detection system.  When the detection system detects 1.5 ppm of chlorine gas, the\nemergency chlorine scrubber system will become active.  If this type of scenario would occur our \ntrained staff and emergency scru"
