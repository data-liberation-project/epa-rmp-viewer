Chlorine, a substance considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is used to manufacture bleach at this facility.  Because chlorine is a regulated substance, OnLine Packaging, Inc. must comply with the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  Compliance involves developing and implementing a risk management plan (RMP), and submitting this RMP to the EPA.\r\n\r\nAt the OnLine Packaging, Inc. plant in Plover, Wisconsin, the maximum inventory of chlorine on site is a 90-ton tank car located on a railroad spur adjacent to the building.  Liquid chlorine is piped from the tank car into the building where it is reacted, under carefully controlled conditions, with caustic soda to produce bleach for consumer use.  The chlorine systems are designed and operated in accordance with Chlorine Institute recommendations, and the employees of OnLine Packaging, Inc. use appropriate safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent accidental releases and minimize any hazards to human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe OnLine Packaging, Inc. Plover plant has been in operation since 1996 and has never had an accidental release of chlorine in any quantity.  OnLine Packaging, Inc. also operates plants in Michigan City, Indiana, and Ardmore, Oklahoma, neither of which have ever had an accidental release of chlorine of any reportable quantity.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, this emergency response plan calls for certain internal procedures and actions to be taken in addition to the immediate notification of the Plover Fire Department, Portage County Emergency Management, the Department of Natural Resources, the National Emergency Response Center. In addition, the Employee Emergency Action Plan is implemented whenever the safety of employees is at risk.  The plan identifies outside"
