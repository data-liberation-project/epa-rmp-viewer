The Beaver Street facility has over a threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated highly hazardous chemical per EPA's 40 CFR-68.  Beaver Street has a unified Risk Management Program as well as OSHA Process Safety Management program that are presented in this summary.\r\n\r\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (a)\r\nBeaver Street Fisheries, Inc. accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.  It also complies with the like requirements of 29-CFR 1910.119 OSHA PSM program.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM(a) (1)\r\n\tBeaver Street has a management system in place which is lead by the Fisheries' Vice President, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other facility-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of an ammonia release at the facility.  An organization chart defines the lines of authority and list responsible staff.  It is included in the plant's Process Safety Information.\r\n\r\n1.1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (a) (2)\r\nBeaver Street Fisheries, Inc. maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus OSHA elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the Beaver Street plant Document Management System (DMS).  The unified PSM/RMP program was implemented in 2004 prior to increasing the maximum inventory above the 10,000 pound threshold.  Beaver Street employs 225 fulltime and 132 staffing service employees engaged in facility and field operations"

The site is located at 1741 West Beaver Street, City of Jacksonville, in Duval County, Florida.  The site is bordered by Robinson Avenue on the west, railroad tracks on the east, McQuade Street on the north and West Beaver Street on the south.\r\n\tThe Plant includes an ammonia storage compressor and transfer system in its Engine Room.  There is an adjacent Control Room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Ammonia Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  Ammonia liquid is delivered to numerous evaporators (refrigerator units located throughout the plant) and returns to the Engine Room and it is liquefied in the rooftop condensers for further use.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  \r\n\r\n1.1.4.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\r\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound, as well as the OSHA PSM threshold quantity.  Beaver Street's ammonia process was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems. \r\n\tAnhydrous ammonia is a toxic chemical; it is an irritant and is corrosive.  Ammonia's formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression.\r\n1.2.\tWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\r\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two ammonia release scenarios.  The first is a Worst Case Release Scenario.  The second is more probable Alternative Release Scenario.  Results are depicted on an aerial map in"

The plant and support equipment of the ammonia compressor room and control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  \r\n\r\n1.3.2.3.\tEquipment Design\r\nThe process is built to good engineering requirements for an ammonia refrigeration system. These materials of construction are steel or ammonia compatible metallic and non-metallic compounds (not corroded by ammonia).  The ammonia pipe system is designed using schedule 80 seamless pipe designed to 2,500 psig.  The typical high pressure of the ammonia system is 145 psig giving a large safety factor.\r\nThe Engine Room has a ventilation system, as well as an eye wash safety shower.  Relief valves are installed on the tanks and compressors. The relief valves all vent to a single stack outside and high above the Engine Room as ammonia is buoyant.  There are ammonia monitors in the Engine Room which detect the presence of ammonia.  The monitor system sounds an alarm and turns on a warning light in the Engine Room and adjacent control room/office.  \r\n\r\n1.4.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (e)\r\nThere have been zero EPA recorded accidents in the past five years.  \r\n\r\n1.5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (f)\r\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Plant Emergency Response Policy and coordinated with the City of Jacksonville (Emergency Response Plan) and the LEPC.

The Engine Room houses a two stage refrigeration system which feeds both freezers and coolers, the cool doc and production areas.  The low temperature system pumps liquid ammonia from the low temp tank to the evaporators (freezers).  Ammonia vaporizes and then flows back to the low temp tank.  Vapor from the tank feeds vapor to the low side compressors.  The output of those compressors supplies the high temp tank.  Ammonia vapors from the high temp tank feed the high side compressors.  The compressor discharge at 145 psig vapor flows to the condensers located on the roof.  They cool and condense the high temperature vapors back to a liquid.  The liquid then flows into the high pressure liquid receiver.  Liquid ammonia under a pressure of 145 psig flows into the high temp evaporators (refrigeration systems for the Coolers, the Cool Doc and Cool Work Areas).  Ammonia gas from these ev"
