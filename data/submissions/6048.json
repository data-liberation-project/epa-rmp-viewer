The maximum stored at 85% capacity would be 133,900 pounds. We have safety and Emergency Action Plans in place. We provide our employees with the appropriate training for handling anhydrous ammonia and responding to emergency releases. We update our programs periodically as needed. Maintenance is performed as needed and is documented in our files. In order to evaluate potential accidental, we performed an off-site consequence analysis using guidance from the fertilizer Institute. The worst case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank. The material would go to a distance of 2.4 miles to its toxic endpoint of dispersion of 200 parts per million. The alternate case scenario would be a transfer hose failure with material being released for 2 minutes until the automatic shutoff valva functions. The distance to the endpoint of 200 parts per million for this case would be .68 miles."
