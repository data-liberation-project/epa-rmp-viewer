This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented to ensure that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change.  Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Harford Mills Terminal located in Cortland County, New York, is owned by Enterprise Terminals\r\n& Storage, LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC..\r\n\r\nThe Harford Mills Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane and butane (LPG).  The propane (or butane) is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline or in rail tank cars and is stored in any of six above ground storage tanks or in the underground storage caverns.  The stored LPG is transferred into highway transport trucks or rail tank cars for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Propane can also be shipped out of the facility via pipeline.\r\n\r\nEthyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection. A small ethyl mercaptan storage tank is on site to provide mercaptan inventory, but the amount of odorant stored at the terminal is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation. The facility also has a 12- spot railcar loading and unloading rack that can be used for the receipt or delivery of propane or butane by pressurized tank cars, as noted above."

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations."

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices. All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices p"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results."
