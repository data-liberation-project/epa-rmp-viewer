We separate hydrogen gas from natural gas in multiple steam methane reformer units.   Hydrogen gas is compressed and shipped to our customers by tube trailer or via underground pipeline.  Liquid Hydrogen tanks are on site for backup to the pipeline.  Carbon Dioxide is a by-product of the Hydrogen Production process. Carbon Dioxide gas is not vented to the atmosphere, but is collected and transferred to our Carbon Dioxide facility where it is liquefied. From there liquid Carbon Dioxide is filled in liquid transport trucks and shipped directly to our carbon dioxide customers.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA;    Hydrogen:  Produced and stored in a gaseous and liquified state.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Manag"
