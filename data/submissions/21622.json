      "SummaryText": " Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\nThe Risk Management Program at  Coastal Berry Company complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) RMP and PSM Guidelines have been implemented at this facility. \n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n2.    Determine Program Level\n3.    Establish a Management System\n4.    Conduct a 5 year Accident History\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Coastal Berry Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Pre-cooling and storage of strawberries.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  The substance is  Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in a flooded industrial refrigeration system.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\".

      "SummaryText": " Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario85. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from NH3 Refrig. (Existing Inventory).  In this scenario 11,232 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.42 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from NH3 Refrig. (Existing Inventory).  The scenario is typical of a compressor seal failure and involves the release of 300.00 lb.. Toxic gas is released for 30 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by Manual equipment isolation.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the total amount released.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.03 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program t"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/16/2000.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Coastal Berry Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCoastal Berry Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCoastal Berry Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maint"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Coastal Berry Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 04/26/2000.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Coastal Berry Company.  The most recent review was performed on 4/26/2000.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCoastal Berry Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 04/26/2000.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCoastal Berry Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCoastal Berry Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
