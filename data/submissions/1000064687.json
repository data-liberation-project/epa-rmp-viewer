      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nSouthcross owns and operates a natural gas liquids fractionation plant (Bonnie View Plant), NAICS Code 211112, located near Woodsboro in Refugio County, Texas.  The facility is designed and operated in manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases.  Southcross has established systems to ensure the safe operation of the facility.  These systems include the risk management program (RMP) to assure compliance with the EPA requirements found in 40 CFR Part 68.  This submission is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements associated with a program 1 facility.\n\n\n\na.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe Bonnie View Plant utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, trained employees take actions to contain, mitigate, monitor and stop releases.  Local responders are prepared for accidental releases through regular communications and meetings.\n\n\n\nThe Sr. Vice President, Operations, with the assistance of the Director, EHS&T, is responsible for the overall implementation of RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) activities.  The Director, Regional Operation, with the assistance of the Plant Superintendent, is responsible for RMP and PSM implementation and integration at the plant.  The Plant Superintendent is responsible for local coordination with emergency responders.  Overall, Southcross makes it the responsibility of all employees to carry out their duties in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nb.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Bonnie View Plant is a 15,000 barrel per day (BPD) plant designed to fractionate natural gas liquids (NGLs) into ethane, propane, butane (normal butane and isobutane), pentanes and hexanes plus. The initial operations of this plant will involve storage of NGLs in three 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks. The NGL product in these tanks will be loaded into trucks for sale.\n\n\n\nAdminist"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 1000064687,
      "SummaryText": "rative controls have been implemented that limit the liquid capacity of the tanks to no more than 95% of the design volume. The storage tanks will hold a combination of ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane and pentane, which are regulated flammable substances listed in the Risk Management Program rule and will be above the EPA's established threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds or at quantities greater than 1% by volume of the mixture.\n\n\n\nc.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe RMP Program 1 requirements are applicable to the Bonnie View.  The applicability of Program 1 requirements was determined based upon a scenario based study conducted by Providence Engineering and Environmental during June 2012.  The processing operations at the plant are currently idle; however, the storage tanks and loading functions are still in operation.  The changes at the plant, and in the area, have not affected the scenario used to determine the RMP program level.   While a prevention program is not required for an RMP Program 1 facility, the plant does maintain a PSM program.  The PSM program contains elements similar to an RMP Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nd.    Five Year Accident history\n\n\n\nThe Bonnie View Plant has not experienced accidental releases that resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\ne.    Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nA local emergency response plan has been implemented at the plant.  The plan was updated in 2016 and represents the current operations at the plant.  Plant and corporate personnel communicate with local response agencies to assure safe response activities.  \n\n\n\n\n\nf. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Bonnie View Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews and a program soliciting safety suggestions from employees.\n\n"
