Wherever we operate, we will conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth.  We will not be satisfied until we succeed in eliminating all injuries, occupational illness, unsafe practices and incidents of environmental harm from our activities.\n\n\n\nThe Lost Cabin Gas Plant is constructed in accordance with ASME code requirements, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility is operated and maintained in accordance with OSHA 1910.119 PSM requirements.  A written emergency response plan is in place which includes coordination and response by Fremont County Emergency Management, if required.  There is several active to mitigation devices in place to minimize a potential release of hazardous chemical and flammables such as H2S and propane.    \n\n\n\nThe Lost Cabin Gas Plant removes carbon dioxide (CO2), Sulfur compounds, primarily hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water from the raw inlet feed gas from 8 gas wells in order to meet pipeline specifications for product sales (natural gas).  The raw gas is cooled and contacted with a solvent to remove contaminates (CO2 & H2S) in each of the three gas processing trains.  One of these gas processing trains contains H2S above the RMP threshold quantity and is considered a Program 3 RMP process.  A propane refrigeration system is utilized in each train to cool the solvent to improve its performance.  Each of the these propane refrigeration systems is equipped with compressors, exchangers, piping, valves and a receiver tank that contains approximately 50,000 pounds of propane stored as liquid under pressure.  Each of these systems is considered a Program 1 RMP process.   \n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of cons"
