      "SummaryText": "Evans Fruit Company operates a controlled atmosphere fruit storage facility warehouse in a rural\n\narea located a few miles west of Mattawa, WA. just off of State Highway 243. The facility typically\n\nis loaded during the autumn over a several week period, then the fruit is held in storage for several\n\nmonths. The last room may be held till close to the next fruit-loading season. During the loading\n\nand unloading times there are a few forklift and truck drivers at the facility. A refrigeration operator\n\nchecks the operation of the system several times a week, while continuous monitoring and alarming\n\nis done by the facility computer control system. Much of the time the facility is unattended, and due\n\nto the rural location there are very few people in the area.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor\n\nthat is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. It is present as both a liquid under pressure, and as a\n\nvapor in the system.\n\nTo maintain a safe facility operation the Evans Fruit Company has developed an emergency action\n\nplan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is\n\ndetected. All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system, which\n\nwill automatically shutdown and pump out any alarming area. Any alarm would also be sent to the\n\nrefrigeration operator by a dial up modem. Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration\n\noperator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures). All\n\nemployees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan.\n\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a\n\nrefrigerant, and has in place both the OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29\n\nCFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68). These programs\n\nare readily available to on-site personal to help in "

      "SummaryText": "maintaining a safe operating facility. As required\n\nby the RMP an Off-site Consequence Analysis has been done for the facility to determine what\n\nimpact the Worse Case, and the more realistic Alternate Case releases of ammonia would\n\nhave to the surrounding area.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years.\n\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia Evans Fruit Company maintains an ongoing\n\nrelationship with an experienced refrigeration contractor in Yakima, and with the Mattawa Fire\n\nDepartment. In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about fifteen minutes away;\n\nresponse from Yakima (owner, refrigeration contractors) is about ninety minutes. Because of the\n\nrural location there are few or no persons being near the site, and because of the distance of\n\nresponders from the plant, the emergency response strategy is essentially passive. Ammonia\n\ncanister masks are available onsite, and the fire department has keys to the facility. In the event of a\n\nlarge release, the release would most likely be over before a proper Haz-Mat team could be\n\nassembled on site. In such cases, it is not expected or intended that persons would attempt to enter\n\nthe facility until proper trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive."
