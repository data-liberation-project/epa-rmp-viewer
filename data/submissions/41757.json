      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into an unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County Florida.  Department facilities comply with applicable procedures and policies of the Untied States Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Department of Community Affairs.  The emergency response policy is specific to each plant and/or facility.  Each facility is in compliance with the emergency response program requirements.\n\nNorthwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility.\n\nThe Northwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility is located on a 67 acre parcel of land located northwest of Race Track and south of Mobley Road at 10890 South Mobley Road.  The site is part of an 1,500 acre multi-use tract owned by Hillsborough County.  The facility was built to process five million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as worst case scenario and alternative release.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario at the Northwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility involves an unspecified failure of  a single one ton container of chlorine.  The EPA-mandated conditions for worst case scenario assume the release of the entire contents as a gas in ten minutes, use of the one hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corr"

The HCWD believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealisitic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes to a vapor.  The remaining liquid forms liguid droplet aerosols.  This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud of chlorine gas.\n\nB.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximatley six percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA mandated meterological conditions, Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/second, highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity are used for the modeling.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered include chlorine leak detection equipment and vacuum piping.  The vacuum piping system will significantly the amount of chlorine released in case of a pigtail or piping failure.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe HCWD general release prevention program is based on the following elements.\nTraining of staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nIn house inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availabilty of Self Contqained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of sophisticated chlorine detection systems.  The facility maintains an on site chlorine repair kit."
