Chlorine is used at the packing shed to sanitize the potato wash water, and at times, to bleach the potatoes.  A qualified vendor is responsible for the chlorine handling and water treatment apparatus.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the refrigerant used in the Hydro-cooler unit to chill the potato wash water in order to help pre-cool the potatoes before they enter the on-site cold storage facility (which itself uses a freon type-22 refrigerant).  A qualified vendor is responsible for the seasonal maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system for the Hydro-cooler unit.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case toxic gas release scenario is considered to be a ton container of chlorine releasing its entire contents in ten minutes under specified weather conditions.  The worst case ammonia release scenario would not affect any additional or different receptors than that of the worst case chlorine release scenario.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative toxic gas release scenario is considered to be a slight leak of either chlorine or ammonia at a valve fitting with a maximum release rate of five (5) pounds per minute under typical weather conditions.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nProgressive Farms has integrated the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) requirements within a comprehensive environmental management system based on the \"One Plan\" format.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nProgressive Farms has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nProgressive Farms uses a comprehensive environmental management system approach to integrate both accidental release prevention and emerge"
