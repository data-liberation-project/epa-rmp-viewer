      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe stationary source is defined as the Oak Farms Dairy facility located at 1148 Faulkner Lane in Waco, Texas.  Oak Farms Dairy produces fluid milk products and is equipped with a refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility.  The refrigeration system contains approximately 12500 pounds of ammonia.\n\nACCENDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\n\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst case release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system receiver.  The receiver can potentially contain the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at this facility.  The model was produced using OCA guidance, including RMPComp.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nA catastrophic event occurs resulting in the failure of the system receiver which contains approximately 12500 pounds of liquid ammonia under high pressure.  This scenario is assumed to occur at a point when all ammonia in the system has been stored in the high pressure receiver.  The normal amount of liquid in the receiver is approximately 4,000 pounds.\n\nResults of the dispersion modeling indicate that the toxic endpoint would extend to a distance of .7 miles from the release site.  Public receptors include residential, school, recreational and commercial facilities.  Environmental receptors include the Brazos River and Brown's La"

The toxic endpoint would extend to a distance of .10 miles.  Public receptors include residential, commercial, and recreational facilities.  No environmental receptors were identified for this scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119, Process Safety Management.  This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event.  A third party response contractor is notified of an uncontrolled release event.  The local fire department has been included in the notification and response plan.\n\nOak Farms Dairy personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in the actual response.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or reportable incidents at this facility in over 5 years.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are no planned changes to the system at this time.  However, any changes will include the latest technology for safety when installed"
