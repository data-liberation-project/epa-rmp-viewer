Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary.\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request.\nWe will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employeeA?s level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\nThe Geneva Terminal was built and put into service in 1953. The facility was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 10A? pipeline and a 16A? pipeline, to the Geneva Terminal from the NuStar Terminal in Concordia, Kansas. The 1,612,500 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of sixteen, pressurized A?bulletA? tanks. The LM is stored in two pressurized A?bulletA? tanks. The propane is removed from the site by either propane trucks that deliver it to various customers, or by one of four pipelines, which consist of two 8A? pipelines and two 6A? pipelines.\nThe Geneva Facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited to;\nA?    OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nA?    OSHAA?s Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38(c).\nA?

We have had no accidental releases in the last five years. \nThe Geneva Emergency Response Program works together with the Geneva Fire Department. The Geneva employees are not first responders, but have received training in the notification process of the Geneva Fire Department (first responder). The employees also participate in an annual evacuation drill, in the event an evacuation is required. \nVarious employees at the Geneva Terminal have received CPR training, and all employees have received annual HAZWOPER training. Numerous other drills are conducted at the Geneva Terminal as stated previously.\nSafety is the #1 core value of our company. Whether in performing everyday work or in the planning and maintenance of project work, safety is top priority. Some of the future improvements towards safety are: \nA?    Management and employeeA?s are teaming together to pursue the OSHA VPP Star award. In this pursuit, there are several changes planned to improve safety and some of them are;\no    Quarterly Hazard Identification Audits\no    Electrical cord quarterly inspection program\no    First Use Vehicle inspection program\no    Lifting sling(s) quarterly inspection program\nA?
