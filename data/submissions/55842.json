The Plant is owned and operated by the Coachella Valley Water District\n(with a mailing address of P.O. Box 1058; Coachella, California 92236). The District's initial submittal for WRP\nNo. 9 was made to USEPA and to the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health on June 21, 1999.\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in the\nCode of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations)\nand the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known\nas the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan - CalARP RMP Regulations).\nThe scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject facility that\ninvolve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine (i.e., chlorine is the only regulated substance handled at the\nPlant).\nPolicy Statement\nIt is the Policy of the Coachella Valley Water District (District) to conduct ALL District activities safely to prevent\nJob related accidents, illnesses, and injuries to employees and others and damage to District and Others'\nproperty. A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased\nefficiency at ALL levels (IIPP).\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe primary operation conducted at WRP No. 9 is the treatment of wastewater (NAICS Code 22132 - Sewage\nTreatment Facilities).\nWater Reclamation Plant No. 9 is a wastewater treatment plant that treats domestic wastes.\nWRP No. 9 use"

The Plant is manned on the day shift and the process is monitored 24-hours per day, 7-days per\nweek, 365-days per year at the District Headquarters located in Coachella.\nMaximum Inventory of Regulated Substances\nThe District's Maximum Inventory of Chlorine is 4,000-pounds (i.e., two one ton containers of chlorine).\nSite Security\nIn order to ensure the security of the site, the District has erected a chain link fence around the entire site.\nAdditionally, the site is equipped with a perimeter security system. Lastly, ALL building entries are equipped\nwith intruder alarms to alert Control of unauthorized access. These site security provisions are intended to\nprevent unauthorized access to areas of the Plant where chlorine is stored, handled or used and seek to\nprovide an added level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the Plant.\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release\nscenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\nthe worst case release; and\nan alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal\nRMP/CalARP RMP Update. These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and\nalternative release scenarios. Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is\ndiscussed below.\nCHLORINE\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Chlorine\nIn this scenario, one of the one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an\nunknown event. This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite\nimpacting the chlorine storage enclosure or area where the one ton cont\nainers are located).

This scenario is\nconsidered to be extremely unlikely. In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-\npounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case). The release of chlorine would occur outdoors. It was\nassumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of chlorine vapor which is\nthen free to migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for\nthis hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 3.0 -miles.\nAlternative Release Scenarios for Chlorine\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the\nrelease of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 2000 -pounds of chlorine. These scenarios include\nsituations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Plant, a pinhole leak in the chlorine\ntransfer piping, a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (100-percent vapor) at various points in\nthe system (out-doors or in-doors), the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the online one-ton\ncontainer, or a leak from the valve assembly of the one ton container. In order to be conservative in the\nestimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 1447-pounds of chlorine was released (over a 60-minute\nperiod) during an accident involving the valve assembly on an online one ton container. The resulting cloud of\nchlorine vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.

These programs include design\nand operating controls such as compliance with specified codes, the District's health and safety program,\nnumerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a\nmechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program), the management of change program, pre-start-up\nreview, fire protection and hot work permit programs, management of- and safety of- contractors,\naccident/incident investigation procedures, emergency response plan, the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP/OSHA\nPSM Program compliance auditing program, the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP/OSHA PSM Program record\nkeeping program and a variety of personnel training programs.

When one of these detectors senses a gas leak at or above 1.0-ppm, audible alarms\nactivate locally and an alarm is transmitted to District Control at Headquarters. At 3-ppm the visual alarm\n(beacon light) on top of the building is activated. Ventilation fans in the chlorinator room run constantly 24-hours\nper day. The alarms can only be reset and cleared after the leak detectors sense less than 1-ppm of gas. The\nalarms are tested by District Operators twice each month.
