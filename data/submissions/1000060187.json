Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information\r\n* Process hazard analysis\r\n* Operating procedures\r\n* Training\r\n* Mechanical integrity\r\n* Management of change\r\n* Pre-startup safety review\r\n* Compliance audits\r\n* Incident investigation\r\n* Employee participation\r\n* Hot work permit\r\n* Contractors\r\n\r\nWe actively encourage participation by all employees in process safety management. Relevant process safety information is readily available to employees. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies consistent with our Management of Change Program. Procedures provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\r\n\r\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change procedure, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued operation. Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures to assure that affected process equipment is properly and safely maintained. The La Porte Plant's Hot Work Permit procedure is consistently enforced to prevent hot work in potentially dangerous areas.\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to minimize accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business. We have established specific accountabilities and controls in support of our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the La Porte plant.

If an incident governed by 40 C.F.R. 68.42(a) were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations designed to identify and address the root cause.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nWe have developed and maintain an emergency response plan which includes planning and training elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and community emergency response plans (LEPC).\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nBraskem believes in a philosophy of continuous improvement. A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. The La Porte plant maintains employee safety teams that meet regularly and a structured safety process.\r\n\r\nThe Company's current plans to further enhance safety practices during 2016 include improvements of employee accessibility to water sampling area, fire water pond area, and rail area.  These proposed improvements specifically respond to employee suggestions.  In addition, enhanced stabilization of some fire monitors will also improve accessibility during usage .\r\n\r\nREVISION OF SITE MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\r\n\r\nExisting onsite designated chemical storage is being modified.  The maximum on-site propane inventory is being increased to 400,000 pounds from 170,000 pounds due to a larger vessel being utilized.  The propylene quantity of 2,500,000 pounds is being reduced by the equivalent increase in propane storage to 2,100,000 pounds.\r\n \r\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario, previously evaluated for the site through the RMP, was based on the release of 424,295 lbs of liquefied flammable hydrocarbons (100% propylene) from a 12"
