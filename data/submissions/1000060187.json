LA PORTE PLANT RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAt the La Porte Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of the La Porte plant and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of improvements made at the La Porte plant to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases that could adversely affect our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n* Certifications in accordance with RMP rule\n\n* Relevant details about the La Porte plant's risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nThe site includes unit operations to produce polypropylene, polyethylene, and ethylene products using multiple chemicals including RMP regulated substances.   \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards to employees, the public, and the environment otherwised posed by these chemicals.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of the accident release and prevention program at the La Porte plant is Process Safety Management. This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic, proacti"

Relevant process safety information is readily available to employees. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies consistent with our Management of Change Program. Procedures provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\n\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change procedure, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued operation. Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures to assure that affected process equipment is properly and safely maintained. The La Porte Plant's Hot Work Permit procedure is consistently enforced to prevent hot work in potentially dangerous areas.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to minimize accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business. We have established specific accountabilities and controls in support of our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the La Porte plant.

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and community emergency response plans (LEPC).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBraskem believes in a philosophy of continuous improvement. A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. The La Porte plant maintains employee safety teams that meet regularly and a structured safety process.\n\n\n\nThe Company's current plans to further enhance safety practices during 2016 include improvements of employee accessibility to water sampling area, fire water pond area, and rail area.  These proposed improvements specifically respond to employee suggestions.  In addition, enhanced stabilization of some fire monitors will also improve accessibility during usage .\n\n\n\nREVISION OF SITE MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\n\n\nExisting onsite designated chemical storage is being modified.  The maximum on-site propane inventory is being increased to 400,000 pounds from 170,000 pounds due to a larger vessel being utilized.  The propylene quantity of 2,500,000 pounds is being reduced by the equivalent increase in propane storage to 2,100,000 pounds.\n\n \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario, previously evaluated for the site through the RMP, was based on the release of 424,295 lbs of liquefied flammable hydrocarbons (100% propylene) from a 12"
