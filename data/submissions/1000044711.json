      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary, Risk Management Plan, 2014 Re-submittal\r\n\r\nCity of Portland Water Bureau, Headworks Facility\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) submittal is for the City of Portland Water Bureau Headworks Facility (Headworks) located at 50105 Rock Cut Road in the Bull Run Watershed, Clackamas County, Oregon.  Headworks uses gaseous chlorine liquefied under pressure to disinfect the drinking water supply.  The Headworks facility qualifies for a program level 1 RMP based on the following three factors.  1) There are no offsite receptors within the area of a worst case release.  2) The facility has not had an accidental release resulting in offsite consequences.  3) Facility emergency response has been coordinated with local responders.  More information on these and other safety aspects is provided below.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Portland Water Bureau to handle and use chlorine and other chemicals in the safest means practicable.  The Bureau has a comprehensive safety program that includes a proactive prevention program, comprehensive training for workers, state of the art neutralization/containment of accidental releases and an Emergency Action Plan for notification of emergency responders and the community in the unlikely event of a chlorine release.  Additionally, Headworks is located in a remote area away from public receptors.  In light of these safety considerations, the benefits of drinking water disinfection (a safe secure supply of clean drinking water) greatly outweigh the minor risk of using chlorine at Headworks.  \r\n\r\nHeadworks Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Headworks chlorination system is located 5 miles behind a locked gate within the Bull Run Watershed which is closed to public access.  The chlorination system consists of two separate rooms:  the Primary Storage Room and the Secondary Storage Room.  A total of up to 36 one-ton containers of chlorine are stored within"

      "SummaryText": "these rooms.  Both rooms are served by an emergency air scrubber system which, when activated by automatic chlorine sensors, has the capacity to neutralize up to 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The emergency scrubber system has a back-up generator allowing it to operate even if electrical power to Headworks is interrupted.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau has voluntarily implemented the substantial requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule at the Headworks facility.  This includes systematic evaluation of critical systems to prevent accidental releases.  In keeping with the Management of Change procedure the Bureau conducts safety reviews any time a process change is proposed.    \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau Headworks facility has no history of chlorine or other chemical release to offsite receptors that resulted in injury, evacuation, or sheltering in place (requiring residents to stay indoors).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau has a written emergency action plan that includes elements covering release response, emergency coordination, responder and community notification, hazard recognition, emergency equipment, evacuation procedures, staff training and emergency exercises.  The Bureau has a full time Emergency Manager who works closely with the State of Oregon's Fire Marshal Regional Hazmat Team #3. The Hazmat Team #3 is the First Responder and has agreed to provide emergency services to Headworks since they are most qualified to respond to chemical emergencies.  \r\n\r\nThe Headworks facility has remote chlorine release sensors that are monitored at the offsite Water Control Center.  The Water Control Center can activate emergency response to Headworks.  Emergency equipment that allows workers to respond to small incidents is maintained onsite.  All employees are trained in emergency response procedures upon hire and periodically thereafter.  The facility is s"

      "SummaryText": "taffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve safety\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau plans to continuously evaluate and improve safety procedures at Headworks as opportunities arise.  Training exercises will continue on a regular basis.  No major safety modifications to Headworks are currently planned.  The offsite consequence analysis was originally generated in 1999 using the DEGADIS 2.1 model.  For this RMP update in 2014 the EPA's RMP*Comp program was used and estimated a more conservative distance of 2.2 miles to the toxic endpoint compared to 0.7 mile estimated by the DEGADIS 2.1 model.  The greater distance is still within the boundary of the watershed which is closed to public access; there are no offsite receptors in the worst case release scenario."
