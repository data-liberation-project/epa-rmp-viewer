The following areas are addressed in this summary:\r\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n-Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n-Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\r\n-Prevention Program\r\n-Five-Year Accident History\r\n-Emergency Response Program\r\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nD'Arrigo Brothers Company (D'Arrigo) committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program. D'Arrigo has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document D'Arrigo policies that address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe D'Arrigo -Spreckels facility provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegatables and produce. \r\n \r\nThe facility is located in a rural area of Spreckels. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Refrigeration Systems 1 and 2) (Refrigeration Systems 1+2 Process), and the Portable Refrigeration Systems (Portable Systems Process). The ammonia quantity in each process is over 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nAll refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems. \r\n\r\nRefrigeration Systems 1+2 Process: Refrigeration Systems 1 and 2 normally operate as separate systems. However, Refrigeration Systems 1 and 2 are treated as one Process due to crossover (normally closed) piping between the two systems. All Refrigeration Systems 1+2 equi"

(Clarification: A separate ammonia diffusion tank [DT-1] serves the permanent Refrigeration Systems 1+2 equipment. There is no interconnecting piping to any Portable Refrigeration System or DT-2.) During the Off-Season, ammonia is transferred to on-site Nurse Tanks before Portable Refrigeration Systems are moved to other sites. All Portable Refrigeration Systems and Nurse Tanks are portable and located outside.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nD'Arrigo's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by D'Arrigo is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of D'Arrigo's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\r\n2. Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a"

D'Arrigo will evacuate affected area, begin notification process, and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department, refrigeration contractor).\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the measures has begun according to the schedule set by D'Arrigo."

Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\r\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. D'Arrigo certifies operators following completion of operator training and D'Arrigo's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training chapter.)\r\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\nSecond, all D'Arrigo employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\r\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by D'Arrigo's Management of Change Procedure.  \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, D'Arrigo has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the compa"

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, a D'Arrigo Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\r\n7. Verification of D'Arrigo's compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by D'Arrigo personnel. D'Arrigo has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \r\n8.

D'Arrigo is a non-responding stationary source, as defined by the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nD'Arrigo's plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies. The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary. The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators. Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \r\n\r\nIn 2021, the plan was updated for the 2019 EPA RMP changes per the associated implementation schedu"
