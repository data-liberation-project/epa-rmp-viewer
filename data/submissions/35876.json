      "SummaryText": "West Hartford Water Treatment Facility\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan District provides water to customers in Hartford, Connecticut and the surrounding area.  To ensure that the water is safe for drinking throughout the distribution system, a small amount of chlorine is added as a disinfecting agent.\r\n\r\nBecause chlorine can be hazardous if not handled properly, The Metropolitan District has established risk management programs for the protection of its employees, the public and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine present at this Metropolitan District is kept in one-ton containers to minimize the potential for harm in the unlikely event of an accidental release.  If such a release should occur, the public will be notified via state and local emergency management agencies.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe West Hartford Water Treatment Facility has conducted an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of an entire one-ton container as a gas in ten-minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance.\r\n\r\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the endpoint concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protection action.  The endpoint (ERPG-2 value) established for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\r\n\r\nFor the wooded and hilly setting of the West Hartford Water Treatment Facility, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration for the worst-case release"

This distance was obtained from the EPA RMP*COMP offsite consequence analysis software developed by the EPA as a tool for risk management planning.\r\n\r\nA major release of this magnitude represented by the worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of one-ton chlorine containers (they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at the West Hartford Water Treatment Facility.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as designed in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in the alternative release scenario(s) section below.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nA credible worst-case scenario was selected as the West Hartford Water Treatment Facility alternative release scenario.  This scenario assumes that the connection to one of the ton containers is completely severed and the resulting vapor release occurs within the building.  The mitigating affects of the building were considered by applying a factor of 0.55 to the release rate modeled for an unmitigated release as described above.  This means that the chemical release rate from the building is 55% of the release rate from the source.  This factor is recommended for modeling the effects of building mitigation in the EPA RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants.  This resulted in a projected release of 8.25 lbs/min from the building or 495 lbs of chlorine in an hour.\r\n\r\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning.\r\n\r\nThe potential distance to the endpoint concentrat"

Based on this commitment, the Manager of Water Treatment has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  Also, the Plant Superintendent has clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the West Hartford Water Treatment Facility maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protection of plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\r\n*chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n*process safety information to document the safe process design;\r\n*process hazard analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\r\n*operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\r\n*maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\r\n*training, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\r\n*management of change and pre-startup safety reviews to ensure that changes are documented, analyzed and kept within the de"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and we know of no chlorine release that has had adverse effects on the public.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event that a chlorine release does occur, The Metropolitan District has an emergency response program that includes trained onsite emergency responders.  Any emergency response would be coordinated with the regional response organizations and Local Emergency Planning Committee.
