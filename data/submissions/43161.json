This plant is located west of Placerville adjacent to the Hangtown Creek.  There are some residences and light commercial occupancies nearby.  The facility processes wastewater from several sources in the City and surrounding communities.    \n\nThese EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Support Documents satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  \n\nA.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe WWTP accidental release prevention policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The facility adheres to all applicable procedures of the federal EPA Risk Management Program (EPA-RMP).  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response of the community and local responding agencies.  It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (ARP) is in compliance with the federal and State OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and is based upon the following key elements:\n\u00bf\tA high level of training for the facility state certified plant operators.\n\u00bf\tA preventive maintenance program with strict adherence.\n\u00bf\tUse of state of the art process and safety equipment to control and neutralize any accidental release of chemical.\n\u00bf\tThe use of an accurate and effective operating procedure written with participation of the operators.\n\u00bf\tPerformance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n\u00bf\tAssignment of the facility chief operator with overall responsibility of the RMP and Cal/ARP\n\u00bf\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program under the direction of the wastewater facili"

This plan, as required by State and local regulatory agencies, also contains information and procedures relating to chlorine and sulfur dioxide processing equipment, handling, leak response and repair procedures, education and safety training.  It contains a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and various report forms.\n \n\nB.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThis hazard assessment was prepared in compliance with Subpart B of 40 CRF 68.  This is described in sections B1 through B9.\n\nB1.\tApplicability\n\nThe Placerville Hangtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant handles both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, both EPA-regulated substances, in amounts exceeding the regulatory threshold of 2,500 lbs.  This process of chlorination and de-chlorination is subject to OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) requirements.  This qualified the Plant as a Program 3 process.\n\nB2.   \tOffsite consequence Analysis Parameters\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis parameters are listed below.\n\n(a)\tEndpoint\n\nChlorine - As required by EPA, the chlorine toxic endpoint used is 0.0087 mg/L.   This corresponds to 3 parts per million by volume (PPM), and represents the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG) \u00bf 2, which is defined as \u00bfthe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00bf\n\n(b)\tWind speed/atmospheric stability class\n\nAs required by EPA, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s), and an atmospheric stability class F were used for performing the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario.\n\n(c)\tAmbient temperature/humidity\n\nEPA RMP regulations fo"

Accordingly, the worst-case release analysis was performed at this level.\n\n(e)\tSurface roughness\n\nRMP regulations require that either urban or rural topography should be used for performing the air dispersion analysis for the identified release scenarios.  The rural and urban topographical conditions are characterized in the air dispersion models in terms of surface roughness.  The rural condition, defined by EPA as \u00bfno buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed\u00bf, is characterized by a surface roughness of 0.03 meter, whereas the urban condition is characterized by a surface roughness of 1.0 meter.  Urban topographical conditions were chosen due to the trees and buildings in the treatment plant vicinity.\n\n(f)\tDense or neutrally buoyant gases\n\nRMP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas released during the identified accidental release scenarios would be denser-than-air-, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling.\n\n(g)\tTemperature of released substance\n\nThe facility process temperature coincides with the ambient temperature.  Therefore, the temperature of any released chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas is the same as the ambient temperature.\n\nB3.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRMP regulations require that a worst-case release scenario analysis be performed in compliance with specified conditions, as detailed below.\n\n(a)\tNumber of release scenarios\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-"

Due to the building enclosure, the maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.\n\nB4.\tAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRMP regulations require that at least one alternative scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic substance.  However, if systems are in place showing that no reasonable scenario could lead to offsite consequences, a scenario that has no offsite impacts can be used for the alternative scenario.  The chlorine facility at the Placerville Hangtown Creek Wastewater treatment plant is provided with a fully enclosed structure having an automatically activated chemical scrubbing system for the released chlorine.\n\n(a)\tScenarios to Consider\n\nRMP regulations require that a scenario, which is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, be selected as the alternative release.  The scenario selected involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails) connected to the one-ton containers.  \n\nUpon release of the chlorine gas from the line, the leak detection system (with battery and emergency power backup) would activate an emergency alarm the chemical scrubber system.

The amount of chlorine released will be less than the EPA reportable amount of 10 pounds.  \n\n(d)\tFactors in Selecting Scenarios\n\nThe rationale for selection of this scenario, which is more likely to occur than the EPA worst-case release discussed in Section B3, is based on performance of a hazard review.\n\nB5.\tOffsite Impacts \u00bf Population\n\nEPA RMP regulations require the determination of the potentially affected residential population within a circle with its center at the point of the release and a radius determined by the distance to the endpoint estimated to two significant digits.  \n\nConsidering the worst-case release scenario, it is estimated that approximately 1,774 people live within the endpoint circle and 200 people within the plume footprint.\n\nDue to the active mitigation systems in place, we believe there is no reasonable alternative release scenario that could lead to offsite consequence to population.\n\nB6.\tOffsite Impacts \u00bf Environment\n\nEnvironmental receptors to be identified include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas, and Federal wilderness areas.  \n\nConsidering the worst-case release scenario, there are no environmental receptors within distance to endpoint.\n\nDue to the active mitigation system in place, we believe there is no reasonable alternative release scenario that could lead to offsite consequence to environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB7.\tReview and Update\n\n(a)\tThe Placerville Hangtown Creek WWTP Chief Operator will review and update the offsite consequence analysis at least once every five years.\n(b)\tIf changes in processes, quantities stored"

The container is provided with a negative pressure regulator on the manifold and an automatic valve shutoff system that is activated in the event of gas release.  The chlorine building is also provided with an automatic chemical scrubber system to neutralize the contents of the tank.\n\n(c)\tWorst case release scenario for toxic gases\n\nAccording to the RMP regulations, it should be assumed that, for toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the quantity present in a vessel will be released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate is assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10.  The boiling point temperature for chlorine is \u00bf31 degrees F; thus, chlorine is a gas at ambient temperature.  The worst-case chlorine release rate was therefore estimated at 200 lb. /min.  The potential of any released gasses from the building is very low taking into consideration the construction and containment the building provides and the chemical scrubber system in place.\n\nA summary of all the parameters selected for the dispersion modeling is presented in Table B-1.  \n \n\n\nTable B-1\nDispersion Model Summary Sheet for the \nChlorine Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nInput Parameter\tRelease Scenario:\nTank Release\nRelease Quantity (lb.)\t2000\nRelease Rate (lb./min)\t200 \nRelease Time (minutes)\t10 minutes\nPhysical State\tGas\nRelease Direction\tGround\nRelease Temperature (degrees C)\t25\nRelease Pressure (atm)\t1\nAmbient Temperature (degrees C)\t25\nAmbient Pressure (atm)\t1\nStability Class\tF\nWind Speed (m/s)\t1.5\nConcentration Averaging Time"
