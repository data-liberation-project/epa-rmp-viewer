      "SummaryText": "emergency response plans have been evaluated by OSHA and no deficiencies were noted.  No citations were issued.  The general procedures are as follows:\n\n1.  Identify the emergency situatiuon.\n2.  Alert the Emergency Action Team via radio or alarm system.\n3.  Evaluate the nature and extent of the problem, then notify local authorities if necessary.\n4.  Initiate a local or general evacuation.\n5.  Coordinate mitigation activities with the local emergency response authorities.\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nThe process safety management policy of Morningstar Foods is as follows:  Identify hazardous processes, evaluate and continuously improve on risk management practicies that reduce the liklihood of a release event or emergency situation at each facility.  We will communicate effectively to management, affected employees and the community the necessary awareness and preparation for the response to any potential or actual events, based on the probability of risk.  We integrate prevention through hazard assessment, practice and policy in order to reduce the liklihood of a release event.  This process includes ongoing training and management of the refrigeration systems.  We maintain compliance with PSM and RMP requirements.\n\nOur company has an extensive audit and critical self-analysis program, which is under the direction and control of the corporate safety department.  Each facility is audited annually.  The audit is performed by the corporate director of safety.  Audit scores are one of the critical plant performance metrics.  Facility management is accountable for the facility performance rating.  PSM, Hazard Communication, Control of Hazardous Energy, Contractor Control, Emergency Action Plan, Evacuation, and many other programs are included in the annual safety audit.  In the event that any deficiencies are found, each audit includes specific follow-up and written corrective measures.  We believe our programs are highly effective as evidenced by our accident history."
