Our +/- 50 employee workforce is comprised of production, maintenance, engineering, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us since the plant began operation.  \r\nThis 85 MW, base load, circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler plant is a Qualifying Facility that began commercial operations in March 1991. The waste coal burned by the plant helps eliminate the source of acid water run-off from waste coal piles in the area and the ash produced by the plant is used beneficially to restore the landscape after removal of the waste coal.\r\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nCambria Cogen uses one chemical, aqueous ammonia, which is stored in a quantity exceeding its TQ. Aqueous Ammonia is used to control NOx emissions from each of the two boilers. \r\n\r\nThe TQ for Aqueous Ammonia is 10,000 pounds and the maximum amount stored on site is 42,500 pounds.  \r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) provides an overview of how we are effectively meeting our responsibilities to the community through compliance with 112(r) requirements.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nCambria Cogen has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its Risk Management Program responsibilities.

The OCA of each chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.\r\n\r\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an important component of the 112(r) rule.
