This program is designed to provide information required by both the RMP rule for Program 3 facilities and the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule at CFR 1910.119.  The program is intended to prevent or reduce the risk of major incidents that might expose employees or off-site populations to the hazards of toxic chemicals, fire, or explosion.  Specific elements include safety information, hazard analysis, operation procedures, training, mechanical integrity, compliance audits, and incident investigation, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hotwork permit, and contractor analysis.",

Therefore, the subject facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\nAbitec's Emergency Response Program was developed in compliance with RMP regulatory requirements cited in 40 CFR 68.90(b)(1) and (3).\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving this process within the past 5-years.\n\nThe Abitec Emergency Response Program limits employees to actions to end small leaks or releases (e.g. shutting a valve), mitigating a release that does not"
