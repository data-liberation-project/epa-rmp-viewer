Therefore, the subject facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\nAbitec's Emergency Response Program was developed in compliance with RMP regulatory requirements cited in 40 CFR 68.90(b)(1) and (3).\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving this process within the past 5-years.\n\nThe Abitec Emergency Response Program limits employees to actions to end small leaks or releases (e.g. shutting a valve), mitigating a release that does not"
