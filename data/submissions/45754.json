The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri-Services in Chaffee are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Chaffee Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid and dry fertilizer and chemicals for direct application to field crops.\n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia to be stored would be 84,118 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker trucks which typically hold 50,000 pounds.\nThe facility has eleven 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 47,685 pounds.  There are also two 1,450\ngallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold 12,577 pounds.  Therefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 144,380 pounds. \n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet the newest codes as time and budgets will allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years. It occurred on 4-6-04 when a valve was left open on a nurse tank during an attempted theft of anhydrous ammonia.  The rel"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n    5/9/06"
