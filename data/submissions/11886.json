The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nBay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred on 1986.  The process is located at 291 Rickenbacker Circle, Livermore, CA 94550.  The chlorine transfer process for Bay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 15 pound cylinder.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 16,000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may"

No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds/minute, however, because the system is located inside the building passive mitigation was considered when determined the maximum down wind distance.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nBay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been a release of a chlorine at the Bay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. on February 26, 1997.  The accident was noted during the Process Hazard Analysis study that approximately 5 pounds of  chlorine was released.  The causes of the release, the facility's subsequent actions, and the mitigation measures that resulted from the incident were discussed as part of the PHA study.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Bay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.

Bay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. performs periodic emergency evacuation drills to enhance the emergency response skills of its personnel.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the Bay Area Pool Chlor, Inc. responsible person, Mr. Kim A. Skinner at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hazard Analysis provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at Bay Area Pool Chlor, Inc.  The changes will be completed by March 1, 2000.\n\nR01 Consider posting emergency telephone number near the telephones and outside the chlorine room entrance.\n\nR02 Consider installation of visible chlorine alarm (i.e., red light) outside the chlorine room entrance.\n\nR03 Consider feasibility of installation of a thermal expansion device.    \n\nR04 Ensure that the delivery trucks are properly chocked prior to unloading the chlorine containers.\n\nR05 Install a windsock visible from all side of the building.\n\nR06 Conduct an evacuation drill at least once a year and document the results.\n\nR07 Post floor plans and/or work place maps with evacuation instructions.\n\nR08 Prepare an emergency response plan including evacuation procedures and rally location.\n\nR09 Test the chlorine detector in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation at least once a month.\n\nR10 Ensure that piping and  flexible line"
