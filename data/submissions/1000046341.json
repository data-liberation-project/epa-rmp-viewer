This is evident by the long-established training procedures utilized by the City coupled with the extensive maintenance program that is followed at the plant.  As an additional measure of safety, an emergency scrubber remains ready for automatic activation in the event a gas leak is detected.  The PC-WWTP is the only City-owned plant used for processing raw sewage.  The plant is capable of handling an average flow of 6 MGD.  The City uses chlorination for disinfecting (inactivating pathogens) effluent discharge.  Chlorine is removed from the effluent by de-chlorination (or removal of chlorine) with sulfur dioxide.  The chlorination and de-chlorination systems are each gas fed under a vacuum.  The presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere in case of piping failure.  This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, which eliminates all pressure piping in the system.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of a 1-ton cylinder in a 10-minute period.  The downwind distance to the toxic end point (AEGL-2) is 2.9 miles for chlorine and 3.4 miles for sulfur dioxide.  The distance to endpoint was estimated using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. The estimated population varied from 12,261 to 18,027.  This analysis ignored any mitigation from the emergency scrubber.  The alternate scenario represents the leak from a valve from the cylinder. For this release scenario, the active mitigation measure of the emergency scrubber cont"

      "SummaryText": "aining the leak is assumed.  This alternate is the release scenario assumed as the most likely to occur\n\n\n\nThe chemical system components at the plant comply with one or more of the following standards: NFPA 58, ASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards.  However, regular maintenance and thorough training sessions will minimize the potential for an accidental release.  \n\n\n\nThe PC-WWTP has not had any accidental chemical releases within the last five years.  If an emergency were to occur, then the scrubber would be automatically activated, and plant personnel notified through the plant SCADA system.  When notified of a leak, plant personnel will call 9-1-1 to notify the fire department.  Next, personnel would contact the Ponca City Emergency Management at (580)767-0380.  Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required.  The fire department and emergency management would work with plant personnel to minimize the impact of the release as drilled in accordance with the county emergency response procedures manual.\n\n\n\n"
