      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Green Verdugo Reservoir Complex to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP Green Verdugo Reservoir Complex Chlorination Station (GVCS) chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the GVCS in June 1999, June 2004, June 2009, and June 2014. The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because GVCS is not subject to PSM standard.. However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP prepared a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009. The 2014 update of the 2009 RMP also demonstrated compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.  This document is an update of the 2014 RMP for the Green Verdugo Reservoir Complex Chlorination Station. \n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and the CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements. The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Green Verdugo Reservoir Complex Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency. The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). The Green Verdugo Reservoir Complex Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\n\n\nThe Green Verdugo Chlorination Station is located adjacent to the Green-Verdugo reservoir, on the west portion of Tujunga Ranch, at 10320 Sunland Boulevard in Sunland, California.  The Green Verdugo Chlorination Station serves to chlorinate water outflow from, and the stored water in, the Green Verdugo reservoir. "

      "SummaryText": " After disinfection, water from the chlorination station is distributed for both domestic and industrial consumption in the Sunland area.  The station consists of a chlorination room (with a mini-scrubber), an instrument room, and a pump operations room. The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  There is a maximum of four chlorine ton containers at the chlorination station.  All four ton containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas. The ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Green Verdugo Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and CalOSHA PSM Standards. However, the facility is normally unstaffed and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  Therefore, the LADWP Green Verdugo Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM standards. \n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, a maximum of four chlorine ton containers are stored at the chlorination station. All the four ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the ton container. Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the ton container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine PVC header lines to one or more of the five chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the ton container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the ton container angle valve, operating as a "

In the injectors, chlorine gas is dissolved into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  This solution is then piped into diffusers to treat the reservoir and the pump station discharge line.  \n\n\n\nChlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor free and total chlorine residual at all feed points.  Motorized valves are provided downstream of each vacuum regulating valve to shut off chlorine feed from the ton containers if the control system senses zero water flow in the pipelines.\n\n\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP's Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.\n\n\n\nA dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has been installed at the GVCS. The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief valve installed on the piping between the vacuum regulator and the chlorinator. The mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.\n\n\n\nIn the event power is lost at this chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room. The chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\n\nThe facility is normally unoccupied; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.
