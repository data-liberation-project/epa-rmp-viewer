We actively look for ways to reduce or environmental footprint through pollution prevention, waste reduction, and conservation of energy resources.  Environmental sustainability is embedded in our purpose, culture, planning and training.  We foster a culture of collaboration, inclusion and engagement where we value the unique perspectives of all stakeholders to meet or exceed the needs of our stakeholders and society. \n\n\n\nThe Chemours Company and the DeLisle Plant are members of the American Chemistry Council and comply with the Responsible Care code of management practices.  Chemours and the DeLisle Plant are also ISO14001 certified.  \n\n\n\nThe Chemours Plant at DeLisle, Mississippi is located on the north shore of the Bay of St. Louis about 15 miles west of Gulfport, Mississippi.  The plant is located on a 2,417-acre site; however, only about 348 acres are developed.  We manufacture a single product, titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure(TM).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride-ilmenite process in which naturally-occurring ilmenite ore is directly chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2.  The RMP covered chemicals we handle are detailed in the following:\n\n\n\n    CHEMICAL                              USE AT DELISLE\n\n    Chlorine                              Produce Titanium Tetrachloride\n\n    Titanium Tetrachloride                Intermediate used in the manufacture of TiO2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe success of the site's PSM program can be gauged by the fact that in the past five (5) years, there have been no accidental releases that resulted in OSHA recordable injuries or off-site shelter-in-place notifications or evacuations of neighbors.

The procedures that comprise DeLisle's emergency response program are contained in the site Emergency Procedures Manual. The Plant has held coordinated drills with community first responders and ensures adequate sharing of incident information.   The Plant ensures the hazard information available to community emergency responders is accurate.  Important keys to the success of our emergency response program include:\n\n   \n\nA well-trained on-site emergency organization\n\nEmergency-response training for all employees, including routine drills\n\nCritique of drills for continuous improvement.\n\nActive Community Advisory Panel"
