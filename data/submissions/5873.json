Selected employees have received extensive training in emergency response from AFD HazMat instructors equal to that received by the HazMat Team.  In case of a hazardous chemical release, the facility operators would determine the severity of the situation and if warranted, would call the HazMat team to respond to the facility.  After an assessment of the situation has been made by AFD and facility personnel, a partnered response to alleviate the problem would be performed.  This partnership makes the best use of the expertise of facility employees and HazMat team.  The Austin Office of Emergency Management would notify citizens via television and radio broadcast of the hazard.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility is continuously evaluating new safety systems, process control equipment, and procedures that would improve the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment."

The Utility's mission is that it will protect our community's public health and environment by effective management of our water resources.\n\nThe Govalle WWTP has established an effective chemical release prevention and emergency response plan.  It is the policy of the Govalle WWTP to take all necessary actions to prevent the release of a hazardous chemical.  Even with an effective prevention program in place, a chemical release incident may still be a remote possibility.  Through planning, procedures, training, monitoring, and a mitigation system, the facility is prepared to promptly perform emergency actions to minimize and contain the release of a hazardous chemical.  Highly trained Govalle WWTP technicians with the aid of City of Austin Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team are prepared to respond to the scene, evacuate the immediate area (if necessary), and control a release.\n\nThe facility and the regulated substance handled:\n\nThe Govalle WWTP provides wastewater treatment services to citizens, businesses, and industries of the City of Austin.  In the process of treating domestic and industrial sewage, the regulated chemical, chlorine, is used and stored at the facility to disinfect the water from microbial contamination before discharged in the Colorado River.  Chlorine liquefied under pressure is delivered in one ton containers.  A maximum of 24 containers are stored in an enclosed storage building.  The administrative controls placed on the amount of chemicals stored allow the facility to maintain safe operating and design conditions.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe Environmen"

      "SummaryText": "tal Protection Agency (EPA) defines a worse-case scenario as the release over a 10 minute period of the largest amount of a listed chemical under very extreme weather conditions and with the total, simultaneous failure of all active safety and emergency backup systems and personnel.  The probability of this scenario is so extremely remote that EPA's basic intention is to identify any potential offsite impacts.  The facility defines its worst case scenario as the total release of a one ton chlorine cylinder due to impact without consideration of an enclosure or other mitigation system.  The EPA developed model, RMP* Comp Version 1.06, was used to calculate endpoint distances as reported in the plan.  The facility reports that the potential for offsite public and environment impact exists.\n\nThe EPA requires facilities to plan for more realistic alternative-release scenarios.  The EPA characterizes an alternative release scenario as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and allows sites to include active and passive control/mitigation systems and more realistic weather conditions in the assumptions.\n\nThe chlorine storage building is specifically designed to limit the release of the process chemical.  The design includes both process controls and a passive mitigation system.  The passive mitigation system is the enclosure.  The process controls used include alarms, gas leak detection systems, and manual shut-off valves.  The facility defines the alternative case scenario for chlorine as a flexible metal tubing leak occurring inside a storage building with the consideration of passive mitigation system.  The passive mitigation system is designed to minimize the alternative scenario release.  The EPA developed model, RMP Comp version 1.06, was used to calculate endpoint distances as reported in the plan.  The facility reports that the potential for offsite impact does exist.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevent"

The rules require the facility to construct, maintain, and operate the chemical facilities in accordance with OSHA, ASTM, ANSI, and ASME Standards.  These rules are intended to ensure safe operation of the facility.\n\nThe Govalle WWTP has established a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The prevention program is intended to assure that facility designs and procedures are reviewed and conform to safe design principles and practices.  The operations, maintenance, and training program elements assure that the processes are within the safe design and operating conditions.  Highly trained employees are on duty 24 hours per day to inspect, maintain, and operate the process chemical systems.  Operational, maintenance, and emergency response procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.  The facility has an established training program that consists of classroom, on-the-job, and demonstration training.  The facility has an established maintenance program that requires equipment identification, testing and inspections, preventative maintenance, training, and documentation.  This is accomplished with the assistance of Year 2000 compliant maintenance software.\n\nThe five-year history:\n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release of the regulated chemical (chlorine) in the past five years.  No documented offsite injuries or environmental impacts have occurred due to a chemical release in the 62 year history of the facility's operation.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nThe Govalle WWTP has established an emergency response program which involves training of employees and a partnership arrangement with the Austin Fire Department Hazardous Materials (AFD HazMat) Team.  The Utility has spent considerable time, money, and effort to train every employee at the facility to respond to a chemical release.  All"
