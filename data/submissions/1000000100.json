      "SummaryText": "The Bear Creek Water Treatment Plant (BCWTP), located at 4930 Gray Road, Douglasville, Georgia, has one independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage and process is located within two adjacent rooms comprising the chlorine process building.  The system has two (2) one-ton cylinders of chlorine on-line and two (2) one-ton cylinders of chlorine on stand-by at any one tme.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and stand-by chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\n\nThe facility has a chlorine gas detector to monitor for leaks in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  Chlorine sensors are located at twelve inches above floor level in both rooms.  In the event of a leak, the chlorine detector will alarm at the facility and in the main control room.  The alarm will also automatically activate a chlorine gas scrubber which will contain and neutralize the chlorine gas.  \n\nThe BCWTP normally stores a maximum of ten (10) full one-ton cylinders of chlorine at any one time.  Empty cylinders are also stored inside the building.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the delivery area, the doors are opened, and the cylinders are brought inside using a motorized crane.\n\nNormally, the chlorine storage and chlorinator room doors remain closed. If a chlorine leak is detected, the alarm will sound, the chlorine gas scrubber will activate, and the operator will notify the Plant Supervisor and appoint a stand-by operator.  The operator and stand-by operator will then don a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and the operator will investigate the cause for the alarm.  The stand-by operator wil remain outside in contact with the operator and ready to call for assistance if needed.  The operator and stand-by operator are trained in chlorine safety and emergency procedures.   If needed, the operator will shut off the chlorine cylinder.  If a leak can not be stopped by turning off the cylinde"
