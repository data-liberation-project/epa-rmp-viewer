The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying 26 acres. An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of wastewater before it is discharged to Aux Sable creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\n\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs approximately 122 people and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, primarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils. The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil. Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\n\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\n\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into organic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin.  The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further processing into soap and personal care products.\n\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where they are reacted with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form fatty nitrile. The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the continuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. The addition of acrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions are also be made in the batch hydrogenation units to form additional variations of secondary and tertiary amines.\n\nIn the quaternization unit tertiary amines are reacted with methyl chloride to form quaternary ammonium compounds.\n\nThe major products pr"

These intermediates and products are used as surfactants in agricultural products, personal care products, detergents and fabric softeners. They are also used as surfactants in a wide range of other industrial processes including food, chemical, highway paving, metal processing, mining, petroleum, paint, ink, paper, pharmaceutical, rubber and polymer processing industries.\n\n2.2\tRegulated Substances\n\nThe site has four substances that are covered by the Risk Management Plan regulations. These substances are raw materials and are acrylonitrile, ammonia, formaldehyde solutions and methyl chloride. A fifth raw material, hydrogen, is listed in the regulations but it is not covered by the regulation at the site because the maximum quantity at the site is below the minimum threshold quantity listed in the regulation.\n\n\n3.
