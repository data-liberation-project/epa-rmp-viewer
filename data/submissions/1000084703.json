The initial system maintains an inventory of approximately 12,800 pounds of ammonia with a maximum capacity of 13,000 pounds of ammonia, and the second refrigeration system is designed for a maximum inventory of 20,000 pounds of ammonia. \n\n\n\nEach refrigeration system utilizes a separate engine room in which most of the refrigeration equipment, including vessels, pumps, and compressors are housed. Condensers are mounted on the roof of each engine room and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n\n\n?    Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n\n\nSouth Refrigeration System Scenario Description: In reviewing the largest vessels and pipping (both indoors and outdoors), the vessel found to have the largest quantity in the South Refrigeration System is the Control Pressure Receiver (SCPR). The SCPR vessel is located in the South Mechanical Room and has a 66\" diameter x 15' overall height. At a liquid level of 80% by volume, the SCPR vessel (rated for 300 psig MAWP) will contain an ammonia charge of approximately 5,033.1 pounds. The enclosure of the ammonia engine room provides a passive mitigation that limits the release rate to the atmosphere. The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F visibility. The EPA's RMP*COMP software was used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions. This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.

Alternative Case Release Result Summary\n\n\n\nIn selecting the scenario modeled for this study, the facility's five year accident history was considered. No accidental releases were identified which resulted in a release of ammonia in great enough quantity as to cause a concentration off ammonia off-site above the toxic endpoint. An alternative, more likely, to occur scenario was selected. This Alternative-Case scenario was be applied to both the North Refrigeration System and the South Refrigeration System.\n\n\n\n    Scenario Description: An ammonia delivery truck is present at the facility to recharge the system. During the recharge process an ammonia transfer line breaks causing a release of liquid ammonia on the ground. Following the Bashas' Standard Operation Procedure - Ammonia Delivery Procedures (SOP-32), the ammonia delivery technician shuts down delivery and evacuates the area. The approximate duration of the release was six (6) minutes. The release was a liquid release, with liquid then boiling off into a vapor when exposed to atmosphere. Based on the flow rate of the delivery and the duration of release an estimated 500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released. The meteo"

Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of each system. For example, the Bashas' Distribution Center facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\n\n\nBashas' maintains an on-going contract with a professional refrigeration service firm. The refrigeration contractors make regular preventative maintenance visits to the facility, ensuring the refrigeration equipment is maintained in a good state of repair. Major repairs are competed on a priority basis; ensuring safety is a top priority.\n\n\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center facility including the ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems. These safety features in each system include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shutdown systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to protect the vessel's integrity during extreme pressure conditions. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrig"
