The primary purpose of this facility is to process live hogs into food products for distribution to retailers.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \r\n\r\nThe facility was built in 1982 and was expanded and updated in 1997 then again in 2017 which included replacing the high pressure ammonia receiver with a new vessel and associated piping system.  Additional improvements to the refrigeration process have been made since then such as the recent addition of evaporative condensers, new machinery room ventilation, vessels, evaporators, and piping. The most recent addition in 2022 included addition of air handling unit, and renovation of the bacon cooling system. Along with evaporators and piping. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 1994 under the PSM standard. The facility was designe"

This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \r\n\r\nThe Manager of Plant Engineering is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \r\nTraining Program: \r\nAn operator training program is designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  \r\nContractor Safety Program: \r\nContractors that are used to work on or adjacent to the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \r\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures: \r\nSee comments under Management of Change  \r\nMechanical Integrity Program: \r\nThe Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.
