Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Amnicola Highway Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Amnicola Highway Site uses 1,3 Butadiene and Anhydrous Ammonia. Ammonia is used for cooling purposes only. 1,3 Butadiene is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used in a variety of products including foams for pillows and mattresses, shoe inserts, general purpose adhesives and for asphalt modification to improve resiliency and extend the service life of streets and highways. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release(s) over the past five years, which meet the reporting criteria.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Facility HazMat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly. The BASF Chattanooga site is also the home of the Southeast Technical Resource and Chemical Emergency Response (TRACER)team which consists of Specialist Level Responders capable of responding to transportation incidents involving hazardous materials. These Specialist Responders have assisted local fire and emergency officials in managing non-BASF emergencies when called upon as well.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, i"

Upgrade the detection of anhydrous ammonia by providing toxic specific sensors for ammonia in all areas of the plant using ammonia. \n  Upgrade the vapor suppression system in the ammonia refrigeration unit by totally surrounding the unit with an emergency deluge system providing a curtain of water for vapor knock down. \n  Install a fixed deluge system directly over the ammonia pre-coolers in the finishing area for vapor suppression and knockdown.  \nA? Installing a fixed & dedicated emergency shortstop addition system to provide the capability of interupting any runaway polymerization event in any reactor. "
