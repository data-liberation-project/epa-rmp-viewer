Upgrade the detection of anhydrous ammonia by providing toxic specific sensors for ammonia in all areas of the plant using ammonia. \n  Upgrade the vapor suppression system in the ammonia refrigeration unit by totally surrounding the unit with an emergency deluge system providing a curtain of water for vapor knock down. \n  Install a fixed deluge system directly over the ammonia pre-coolers in the finishing area for vapor suppression and knockdown.  \nA? Installing a fixed & dedicated emergency shortstop addition system to provide the capability of interupting any runaway polymerization event in any reactor. "
