      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n \n\nFacility Background\n\n\n\nThe Weyerhaeuser NR Columbia Falls, Montana complex consists of a log yard and a medium density fiberboard (MDF) facility.\n\n\n\nIn the MDF process, sawdust and planer shavings are refined into fine cellulose fibers.  These fibers are then mixed with urea formaldehyde resin and dried to the proper moisture content.  The dried fibers are then formed into a mat and pressed into MDF panels.  These panels are sanded, cut to final size, and packaged for shipment.\n\n\n\nIn the MDF process ammonia is added to the MDF panels where the ammonia reacts with the free formaldehyde to bind the formaldehyde to prevent future formaldehyde off gassing.  Liquid ammonia is transferred from the ammonia storage tank through a pump to a vaporizer. In the vaporizer the ammonia is converted from a liquid to a gas. From the vaporizer the gaseous ammonia goes through a filter and flow control instrumentation to the vacuum treatment chamber where the ammonia is pulled through the MDF panels and reacts with the formaldehyde. Any residual, unreacted ammonia then goes through a baghouse filter to a vacuum pump, then is discharged to the atmosphere through a vent stack.   \n\n\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR management is committed to a zero injuries/illness approach to safety. All accidents, injuries, and occupational illnesses are considered to be preventable and the causes leading to them are manageable. Assurance of a safe and healthy environment is everyone's responsibility. Weyerhaeuser NR has comprehensive written safety, health, and environmental programs and procedures. Safety, health, and environmental professionals from the regional office are assigned to the facility.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances above a threshold amount to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm t"

The requirements of the plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe Weyerhaeuser NR AF Line ammonia system is subjected to the RMP requirements because ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.  There are 3 different RMP compliance programs. Because the facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, the facility's ammonia system process is subject to the most stringent of three RMP programs (Program 3).\n\n\n\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public. The hazard assessment includes a worst-case (low probability) and alternate release (more probable) scenario, and a 5-year history of accidental releases of ammonia. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serves as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require a submittal to the USEPA. This submittal includes an Executive Summary and is referred to as the RMP Submittal. \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment for RMP\n\n\n\nA Weyerhaeuser NR MDF facility AF Line ammonia system Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public.

In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of ammonia was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The Hazard Assessment considered two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" (low probability) and an \"alternative\" (more probable) case. \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have not been any accidents associated with the AF Line ammonia system for the past five years.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program for RMP/PSM Plans\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, makes up the RMP/PSM Plan. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.  These 12 elements are summarized below.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR supports and encourages employee participation in its safety program.  Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the employees and it allows the employee's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan. Employees are involved in the facility's incident investigation of near misses, as well as accident investigations, safety meetings, developing and/or revising operating procedures, and employees participating in the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below.  MDF facility employees and contractors receive hazard awareness training that instructs them on how hazards may impact their jobs. Those employees who operate and maintain the AF Line ammonia system are trained in how to safely maintain and operate these processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP program for the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system.

The information is supplied to contractors who work in the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system area as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information is being used by Weyerhaeuser NR staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHA that was performed for the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system.\n\n\n\nThe MDF facility AF Line ammonia system PHA was conducted in November 2015 by an interdisciplinary team of Weyerhaeuser NR employees familiar with the process operation and maintenance, and plant management. The PHA was done using a combination of  What-If and Checklist methods. Based on the results of the PHA, the facility will review the ammonia transfer procedures with the vendor and verify the existence of excess flow valves to assure that safe procedures are being followed.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures for the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system have been developed as part of the RMP/PSM. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing employees.\n\n\n\nThe detailed operating procedures include startup, shutdown and emergency operating procedures.

Employees involved in operating or maintaining the AF Line ammonia system must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards, and safe work practices.\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR MDF facility employees have received initial training on the operations and maintenance of the regulated processes, an overview of each of the RMP/PSM plan elements, and the procedures that must be followed to comply with the requirements of the RMP/PSM plan. In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, Weyerhaeuser NR MDF facility's employees have been trained to respond to an accidental release. Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. Refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR MDF facility must make contractors aware of the known hazards of the AF Line ammonia system process related to the contractors' work.

No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely. \n\n\n\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the Process Safety Management Plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-Startup Safety Review Form.

The employees that carryout maintenance are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM.\n\n\n\nHot Works Permits\n\n\n\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the AF Line ammonia system. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.  The process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace.

A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared, and changes recommended as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what equipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material leaked, reacted, or exploded. As part of the incident review, employee's actions that may have contributed to the incident will also be reviewed. A determination will be made as to whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees to prevent the incident from occurring in the future. On the incident investigation report form, the MDF Plant Manager identifies which of the recommended system changes are approved for implementation. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all employees who operate and maintain the AF Line ammonia system. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nThe MDF facility is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP/PSM program.
