Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Publix Super Market, Inc. (Publix) Jacksonville Warehouse Facility is located at 9800 West Beaver Street, Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Publix \u0012s corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Publix Jacksonville Warehouse Facility is located north of Interstate I-10 and south of West Beaver Street in the western portion of the city of Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.  The warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Publix Super Markets.\n\nThe Jacksonville Warehouse has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system\u0012s equipment is located in the perishable warehouse in the machine or compressor room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) or storage vessel is located inside this room.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system capable of holding approximately 25,086 lbs. of ammonia.  \n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of the HPR vessel, releasing 25,086 lbs. of ammonia gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions and considering passive mitigation, the ammonia gas could travel 1.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L) using the Am"

Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Jacksonville Warehouse refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Jacksonville Warehouse facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in an offsite consequence in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Jacksonville Warehouse Facility has Emergency React Procedures in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, and the Northeast Florida Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911."

Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration the passive mitigation of the HPR being enclosed, the ammonia gas could travel 0.30 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L) using the Ammonia Guidance results.\n \n4. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Jacksonville Warehouse refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Jacksonville Warehouse facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Jacksonville Warehouse has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in 1995 for the ammonia process.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Jacksonville Warehouse also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout"
