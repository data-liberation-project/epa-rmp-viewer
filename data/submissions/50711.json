      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Cytec Mt. Pleasant Site has been manufacturing chemicals safely for over 50 years.  The site originated as Victor Chemical in 1957.  The Site became part of Cytec Industries in August 2003.  The Mt. Pleasant Site has 140 full-time employees.  The chemicals manufactured at the Mt. Pleasant Site are used by industries to make products familiar to our daily lives - copier machines, paints, plastics, acrylics, rubber hoses, make-up, copper and swimming pools.  The Site consists of over 900 acres with approximately 100 acres used as manufacturing space.  \n\nUnderstanding and managing risks is a fundamental part of how we operate.  Cytec is committed to continuously improve its safety, health, and environmental performance.  We take safety very seriously and we have an excellent program in place to prevent accidental releases of all the chemicals we handle.  We use a variety of safety and operating procedures to prevent releases from occurring.  Our employees are committed to working safely with all the chemicals we handle as evidenced by excellent safety record.\n\n(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Mt. Pleasant Site has two chemicals that are covered by the RMP rule (chlorine and phosphorus trichloride).  Both of these chemicals are considered hazardous by the EPA.  These chemicals are used as raw materials in our manufacturing processes.\n\nA review of our past safety performance shows that we have have had no accidental chemical release in the past 10 years that has impacted the health and safety of the local community around our facility.  It is our policy to meet all the laws and regulations relevant to our industry at the local, state, and federal levels.  The properties that make these chemicals valuable as building blocks for our manufacturing processes also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions.
