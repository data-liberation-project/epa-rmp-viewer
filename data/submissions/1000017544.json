There are operations that occupy space on both east (9302) and west (9301) sides of Garfield Avenue.  \nThe primary business of the Lunday-Thagard Refinery is processing crude oils that produces finished asphalt and unfinished petroleum distillates.  The main operation is crude oil distillation.  The facility uses atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation as the mean to physically separate the crude oil into fractions.  The present rated capacity of the refinery is 9.5 KBPD of crude.\nThe facility has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP requirements (40 CFR Part 68).  Lunday-Thagard Refinery is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The Lunday-Thagard Refinery staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely distilling and storing the covered chemical, naphtha. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nLunday-Thagard Refinery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered processes.  Lunday-Thagard Refinery's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nLunday-Thagard Refinery processes crude oil and hence handles all the hydrocarbons that comprise crude oil.  Thus, there are hazardous substances that are utilized in or generated by the process. \nBased on the EPA definitions of flammable hydrocarbons, the quantities of the regulated flammable mixture in processing areas as well as at storage tanks at the facility consists of a TOTAL of 256,420 lbs "

They are as follows:\nNaphtha Overhead Process \nThe crude tower Naphtha Overhead process, consisting of Naphtha, includes approximately 18,000 lbs of inventory, and includes the crude tower overhead, a naphtha accumulator, a series of heat exchangers, and associated pumps and piping.\nNaphtha Storage\nTwo atmospheric Naphtha storage tanks, each with a 20,000 gallon capacity, include an administrative control limiting the maximum inventory to 22 of the 24 ft height of the tanks (approximately 91.7%), which provide the ability to store a maximum of 119,210 lbs of Naphtha in each tank, for a total maximum inventory of 238,420 lbs of Naphtha.\n \nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary for Toxics\nNot Applicable for EPA RMP. \nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary for Toxics\nNot Applicable for EPA RMP.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary for Flammables\nScenario Description: After a preliminary evaluation of the naphtha at several locations, one worst-case release scenario was modeled which included a release of the Naphtha Storage Tank.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment - Flammables documentation behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Submittal Binder located at the facility. \nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary for Flammables\nScenario Description: One realistic alternative release scenario was modeled which considered a pipe shear.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment - Flammables documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Submittal Binder located at the facility. \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough petroleum refining has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Lunday-Thagard Refinery has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.

The system undergoes periodic preventive maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by Lunday-Thagard Refinery to manage process safety issues associated with the covered processes.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  \n\nLunday-Thagard Refinery's EPA RMP Prevention Program 3 elements for the flammable substance, Naphtha, include:\nA?
