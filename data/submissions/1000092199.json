      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker safety, public safety, and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil modified its safety programs in 1991 by adopting a structured safety management system entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) which was adopted by the Olathe Grease Plant when it was acquired by ExxonMobil in 1996. Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001. After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, it concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard. It went on to say, We further believe ExxonMobil to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant, located in Olathe, Kansas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce lubricants and lubricating products.  The plant has two regulated toxic chemicals stored in quantities over the threshold values.  These are Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) and cyclohexylamine (CHA).  Toluene Diisocyanate (CAS # 26471-62-5) is made up of an isomer mixture of 60-80% 2,4-TDI (CAS #584-84-9)"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. \r\n\r\nFor the process areas that involve toxic chemicals, the plant has identified specific process parameters such as air control from the scrubber system, level, temperature, and air monitoring.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a permit and procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

These materials are received in bulk and drums. The site does not store any regulated flammables over a threshold quantity. \r\n  \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant. EPA's Program 2 prevention requirements were implemented. In addition, ExxonMobil Corporation has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at each of its operations worldwide that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program.\r\n\r\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of the RMPlan. Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing. To minimize rework, we selected June 17, 2019 as the date to begin collecting this information. Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling work procedures, job loss analysis forms, and performing loss prevention observations on maintenance and operations' job tasks.  Employees also participate as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safe"

The team has members from various areas of the plant, including manufacturing, packaging, maintenance, SSH&E (Safety, Security, Health, and Environment) coordinators, and plant management. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents include, but are not limited to batch procedures, chemical handling procedures, job loss analysis forms, alarm management documents, and Original Equipment Manufacturer manuals.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up to date process safety information.  \r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process areas that involve toxic chemicals, the plant has identified specific process parameters such as air control from the scrubber system, level, temperature, and air monitoring.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (alarm systems). \r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for operations and maintenance personnel, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skill, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information and therefore, is controlled by management of change (MOC).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Olathe Grease Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3) normal and (4) em"
