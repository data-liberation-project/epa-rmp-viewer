Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nKentucky Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Louisville facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents the facility has established a Facility safety Program.  The objectives of the program are to maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Facility Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Larry Slauenwhite, Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of these programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emerency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and environmental and property damage which may result from such occurrences.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on rules,procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Facility Safety Program the Kentucky Distribution Center follows these co"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a distribution center warehouse storing grocery items, perishable and frozen food products for distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for maintaining appropriate storage temperatures for produce and frozen food storage.  The amount of ammonia contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 lbs.  System maximum inventory is ~31,000 lbs.  Since an ammonia release from the system could cause adverse on and off site health and environmental effects the facility is subject to both OSHA Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) regulations.  The facility is subject to Program 3 level requirements of the EPA RMP regulations.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the Kentucky Distribtuion center involves the release of 12,000 lbs of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quntity represents the maximum capacity of the receiver.  Under worst case atmospheric conditions the ammonia could present a health hazard to the public to a distance of 1.2 miles.  This distance was determined using the methodology proscribed by the EPA RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst case scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nWorst case weather conditions are rare\nIndustry standards and good engineering practices were followed in the design and installation of the system\nThe receiver is located in a low traffic area within an Engine Room designed to industry standards\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessel is relatively new\nAmmonia "

Under the alternative weather conditions ammonia could pose a health risk to a distance of .10 miles.  This distance was determined using the methodology proscribed by the EPA RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is considered unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nIndustry standards and good engineering practices were followed in the design and installation of the system\nThe system is operated at a considerably lower pressure than the relief pressure\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service\nThe facility has a preventive maintenance and inspection program for maintenance and testing of the relief valves\nThe facility has a training program to ensure that Operators are qualified to maintain and operate the vessel and system\nFacility Emergency Response Procedures are designed to enable rapid response to and isolation of any release\n\nD.

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they are working safely.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:  Pre-startup Reviews are required for all new ammonia related equipment and systems to verify that all information is in place, that appropriate reviews have been conducted, that equipment is installed properly and that procedures and training are in place prior to start-up.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Maintenance and inspection procedures have been eveloped and put in action to ensure that equipment and systems operate properly and that they are inspected in an appropriate frequency and manner.

A releae of ~80 lbs of ammonia occurred on 6/30/2001 during a system expansion project which resulted in non-severe injuries to 5 employees.
