      "SummaryText": "CFS West Holdings, Inc. is a Kansas corporation having a food (mayonnaise, salad dressings, sauces, & similar items) manufacturing facility in New Century, Kansas. An integral part of the manufacturing process is the use of refrigeration to cool and/or \"crystallize\" the various products and to maintain the finished products at proper storage temperature prior to shipment. At CFS West Holdings, Inc. the refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in a non-contact closed loop refrigeration system. Ammonia exists as a gas at atmoshperic pressure, however, ammonia is found in both gaseous and liquid (liquified by pressure) forms within the ammonia refrigeration system, depending upon where it is located in the system. The ammonia refrigeration system is distributed throughout the production and storage areas of the facility.\n\n\n\nCFS West Holdings, Inc. is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.119) as well as similar state regulations. The various elements of the Process Safety Management Program at CFS West Holdings, Inc. form the core of the accidental release and emergency response efforts at the facility. CFS West's corporate policy requires compliance with these regulations in accordance with its written PSM/RMP programs.\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no reportable accidents since startup in 2001.\n\n\n\nCFS West Holdings, Inc. is committed to process safety and a such has endeavored to design and construct a facility which can be properly maintained and operated safely throughout its life.
