The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 20 CFR Part 1910.119.  The PSM program is based upon the plant's contract operators, Veolia Water North America Operating Services, existing program.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is CE's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements.  The chlorination process at the Edwardsville Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by USEPA and OSHA.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Edwardsville Water Treatment Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage,conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees,contractors, and visitors at the Edwardsville Water Treatment Plant and the immediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to anychlorine release that may occur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Edwardsville Water Treatment Plant provides treatment for up to 7.7 million gallons per day of raw well water.  The regulated substance handled at the Edwardsville Water Treatment Plant is chlorine. Chlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in ton containers.  The storage building maintains one full container at 2,000 pounds, a second container at or below 500 pounds for a total not to exceed 2,500 pounds of chlorine."

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate chlorine use.  From the chlorinators,chlorine gasis distributed under vacuum to injectors.  The injectors combinethe gaseous chlorine with water. The chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for disinfection at two locations, before and after filtration.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nVeolia Water North America Operating Services complies with USEPA and OSHA requirementsfor Prevention Programs for the PSM.  Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informedof chlorine hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area.  Standard operatingand maintenance procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nVeolia Water North America Operating Services has an emergency response program in\r\nconjunction with the CE's Fire Department.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storagearea for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and the CE's Fire Department are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the CE's Fire and Police Department's for notification of the public.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents on site in the last five years.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nVeolia Water North America Operating Services uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in CE's Prevention Program.  Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenance procedures, and additional preventative maintenance procedures.  Audits of the RMP and PSM programs are conducted every three years to verify the effectiveness of the program.\r\n  \r\nRMP Valid"
