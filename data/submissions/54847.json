(Purity Dairy) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at its Nashville, TN facility.  \n\nPurity's operations include storing frozen foods, dairy products, and distribution.  Purity has been in operation at this facility for over 40 years, providing quality dairy products and over 500 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIn this facility, we use Anhydrous Ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This chemical must be used to provide cooling for the process and surrounding areas.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions for handling these substances and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health, as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, as well as the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nPurity Dairy is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore, it is Purity Dairy?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nPurity Dairy  is subject to 112(r) because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.

Purity Dairy uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the process and facility within the required range of operating temperatures. Purity?s refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in two systems contains a maximum amount of 44,719 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The larger of the two systems contains 28,502 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as of Nov. 2007.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Purity has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\nPurity has implemented OSHA?s PSM program and as such, has evaluated and engineered against anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are: process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Nashville Fire Department HazMat team responds to any ammonia release at the facility.  Seven (7) Purity personnel are trained to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat).\n\nPurity has developed standard operating procedures, which incorporate safety measures into the procedures, for all employees and contractors who have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety procedures were developed by Piedmont Corporation and are reviewed on an annual basis.  Purity encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters and train"

Any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees by following written management of change procedures established by Purity.\n\nPurity understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore, Purity has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using computer maintenance management and manual checklists with the MP2 Manager (currently Richard Dutton) to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system\n\nTo ensure that Purity's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Purity conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporate review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures. \n\nIn addition, Purity is audited by the AIB on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Purity has not experienced an accidental off-site release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system\n\n    Emergency Response Program \n    \n    Purity has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled PURITY DAIRIES EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN, to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the SOP are measures to be taken internally by Purity.\n    \n    Purity has trained 17 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.

These personnel received initial training and an annual update training thereafter.  As an additional training exercise, simulations of an emergency release with off-site effects are conducted regularly with the entire emergency response system. This simulation will be critiqued and changes made to the SOP as appropriate.  Purity intends to do another simulation in the near future. \n    \n    To plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Purity?s SOP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n    \n    In addition to the above local response agencies, Purity has available emergency response assistance from local clean-up contractors. In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n?    Sirens\n?    Broadcast message local radio stations.                  \n?    Police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems, and\n?

An additional PHA on the new equipment was conducted.  No additional possible hazards were identified.  \n\nBelow are the original audit results.  All suggestions have been implemented:\n\nAs a result of Purity?s initial process hazard ana"
