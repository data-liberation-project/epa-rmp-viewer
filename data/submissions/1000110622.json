Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSun Valley Packing has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sun Valley Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun Valley Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun Valley Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nSun Valley Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Valley Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Sun Valley Packing"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nSun Valley Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Valley Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nSun Valley Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nSun Valley Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- Federal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \n- California Hazardous Waste Operat"
