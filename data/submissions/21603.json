      "SummaryText": "Joule-Thomson (J-T) Process, Pressurized Liquids Tank - Reliant Energy Field Services (REFS) plans to install a J-T process unit at the proposed West Center Compressor Station near Center, Shelby County, Texas.  The station's purpose is to compress natural gas for pipeline transmission; the J-T unit will be used to remove liquids from the gas.  The unit cools the gas to 0o to 10o F, and excess liquids condense from the gas stream and are sent to a pressurized 6' x 70' tank.  The liquids will consist mostly of hexane and heptane, which are not 112(r) regulated substances, but n-propane, n-butane, i-butane, n-pentane, and i-pentane will also be present in the tank.  For the worst-case scenario, an analysis for a similar operation is used to estimate the maximum quantities of each regulated substance that can ever be expected to be present in the tank at one time.  This quantity is conservatively assumed to be 20,000 lb for each regulated substance. The endpoint given by RMP*Comp for this scenario is 0.4 miles.  There are no receptors within this endpoint.\n\nWithin the last five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP."
