As a result,accidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted which include:operating and maintenance procedures,training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine,notification of trained personnel,an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that local emergency response is needed.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of a one-ton liquid chlorine container in ten minutes,or 200 lb/min. For the worst case release scenario,a wind speed of 1.5meters/sec. And an atmospheric stability class F was used. Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 3.3 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario as described is this program was based on a chlorine container isolation valve stem failure. A release rate of 0.16 lb/min.,a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., and an atmospheric stability class D was used. This data when modeled, produced no off-site impacts.\n\nThe dispersion modeling for both scenarios was conducted using the SLABVIEW program,version 1.15 and site specific information.\n\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporated operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves,leak detection systems and alarms.\n\nNo accidents have occurred at the site in the last five years. Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program,including an evacuation plan,assembly areas,and other safety information has been developed. This program has been coordinated with the City of Baltimore's Emergency Response Program-SARA title lll off-site response plan.  The o"
