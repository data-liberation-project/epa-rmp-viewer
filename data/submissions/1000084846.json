We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable  federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThis facility is designed to comply with ANSI K-61.1 and programs and procedures are in place to comply with OSHA 1910.111 requirements of anhydrous ammonia storage. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency. \n\n\n\nA description of your facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage. We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck and store it as a liquid in a pressurized vessels. Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the facility is 24,000 gallons (water capacity).\n\n\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 12,000 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60F), resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 2.6 miles based on RMP Comp. This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 516 residents, commercial/industrial areas and churches within the distance to endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to a cracked hose or failed fitting. The operator observe the leak and isolates the hose by cutting o"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI K-61.1, OSHA 1910.111 and state law.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Review:\n\nWe conduct comprehensive reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. These activities are undertaken by qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nWe  maintain written procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia storage facility. These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is readily accessible to operators.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nWe have a training program in place to ensure employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as required.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits :\n\nWe conduct compliance audits on regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are performed at least every three years and any cor"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nDue to our  comprehensive safety program, this facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, serious injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency , it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe will continue to implement our safety program to guarantee that our facility is operated in a safe and reliable manner and to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community."
