There have been no off-site accidents within this time period.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Cascade System Gas Processing Plant has an emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment."

When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Cascade Systems gas plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cascade System Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Toole County  Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Cascade System Gas Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."

The basic aspects of this program include:\n\n(1) conducting training,\n(2) developing procedures,\n(3) performing inspections and tests,\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and\n(5) applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel sometime receive training on:\n\n(1) an overview of the process,\n(2) safety and health hazards,\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures,\n(4) emergency response plans, and\n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nThese procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

The Cascade System Gas Processing Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Cascade Systems gas plant has standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:\n\n(1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\n(2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing             maintenance,\n(3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened,\n(4) a procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and\n(5) a procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Cascade System Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Cascade System Gas Processing Plant have hazards that are  managed to ensure continued safe operation.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention And Response Policies\n\nThe NRC Pipeline, LLC Cascade System Gas Production Plant has a standing commitment to worker protection and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Cascade System Gas Processing Plant, located near Oilmont, Montana operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g.  natural gas, propane and condensate) from natural gas.  The Cascade System Gas Processing Plant produces and stores propane, a regulated flammable substance.  There are no regulated toxic substances at the Cascade System facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the facility consists of a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing 16,800 gallons (71,232 pounds) of natural gas liquid propane.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 90% of the maximum tank capacity; therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.3 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe hazard assessment results for the flammable WCS event is graphically presented as Figure 1.\n\nCon"
