The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nTri-Marine Fish Company maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Tri-Marine Fish Company facility is located at 220 Cannery Street, San Pedro, California 90731.  The plant is located about 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles) south of Vincent Thomas Bridge in Terminal Island.  The immediate area is primarily industrial with commercial and residential areas to the west across Los Angeles Main Channel.\n\nThe facility uses approximately 20,000 pounds (3,600 gallons) of ammonia as a refrigerant within closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSY-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HP-1).  High pressure liquid ammonia is tran"

Ammonia is returned from CH-1 to IC-1.  IC-1 supplies liquid ammonia to the Liquid Recirculator #1 (RC-1).  IC-1 also transfers liquid back to HP-1 through the use of a Liquid Transfer System (LR-2).  RC-1 supplies liquid ammonia to five Blast Freezers Evaporators (PC1 - PC5) and a mixture of partially vaporized ammonia is sent back to RC-1.  RC-1 also transfers ammonia back to HP-1 through the use of a Liquid Transfer System (LR-1).  Liquid ammonia is supplied to the Liquid Recirculator #2 (RC-2) from C5's liquid subcooler.  RC-2 supplies liquid ammonia to Freezer #1 Evaporators (PC6 - PC9) and Freezer #2 Evaporators (PC-10 - PC12) .  A partially vaporized mixture is then sent back to RC-2. Hot gas from the compressors is used as a defrost for all evaporators (PC1 - PC12).\n\nVapor is pulled from the recirculators, RC-1 and RC-2 to the five compressors.  Discharge from two Booster compressors (C3 and C4) is returned to IC-1, whereas, the discharge from the High Stage and Single Stage compressors (C1, C2, and C5 respectively) is sent to the two Condensers (EC-1 and EC-2).  A thermosyphon supply and return from TSY-1 is sent to the compressors for oil cooling.  High discharge vapor is condensed to a high pressure liquid through EC-1 and EC-2 and returned to TSY-1.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The system also has a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that is stored in the largest vessel - 15,856 pounds in 10 minutes.  The largest vessel, high pressure receiver, is located inside the engine room, therefore, passive mitigation measures were used to cal"

The reference table 4-4 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, Nov 1998 was used to find the distance for the worst case release scenario to 200 ppm.  This potential scenario reaches off-site and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  Exhibit 4-5 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for urban topography.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Tri-Marine Fish Company facility including the  ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include  ammonia sensors and automatic shut down buttons both located throughout the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe refrigeration system at the facility is new as of September 1999; therefore there is no accident to report.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tri-Marine Fish Company has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.
