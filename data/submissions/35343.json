In accordance with U.S. EPA \r\nregulation 40 CFR 68, the U.S. EPA has identified quantities for 140 toxic or flammable \r\nsubstances that require a facility to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule when \r\nunit inventories exceed threshold quantities.  The RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit \r\ninventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA \r\napproved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP \r\ncovered facilities to update its Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) every five (5) years or six (6) \r\nmonths after an RMP reportable incident.  Union Carbide Texas City Operations initially \r\nsubmitted its RMPlan in June 1999.  In compliance with 40 CFR 68, Union Carbide Texas City \r\nOperations is submitting the five (5) year update to its initial RMPlan submittal.\r\nSince Union Carbide Texas City Operation's initial submittal in June 1999, Units 81 (OXO) and 82 \r\n(FARM) have reduced RMP chemical inventories to below threshold quantities.  As a result, these \r\nunits have been removed from the current RMPlan.  In addition, Unit 85 (#3 Olefins) has been \r\ndecommissioned and the majority of chemical inventories have been reduced below the \r\nthresholds, resulting in the removal of those inventories from the RMPlan.\r\n\r\nUnion Carbide Texas City Operations currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances \r\nabove threshold quantities:\r\n\r\nEthyl ether - CAS No. 60-29-7\t\r\n2-Methylpropene - CAS No. 115-11-7\r\nIsopropyl chloroformate - CAS N"
