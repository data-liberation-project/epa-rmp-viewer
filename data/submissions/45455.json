This program will help prevent the ocurrence of, the consequence of, catastopic release by stating our ploicies and procedures for the management of process hazard in the start-up, operation, maintenance and other matter addressed in the Federal Standards. Our program calls for maximum employees participaton and includes all elements of the employee participation provision of the standards. We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with the employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their represntatives acess to the process hazard review and all other information requiredto developed under that standard. At the Havana Water Treatment Plant we use Chlorine as a disinfection; killing numerous waterborne pathogens that potentially resent in the raw water supply. It is our responsibility to protect the public from any type of waterborne pathogens, at the same time to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposeure and reduce the threat to our employees as well as to our surrounding customers. Our policy is to apply by the Federal and State Rules and Regulations. Safety awarness and training is our primary action to protect our employees, while working around chlorine cylinders full or empty and connecting them."
