Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAgrium U.S. Inc., Sacramento Nitrogen Operations handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous material and is a regulated substance under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of anhydrous ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  The prevention of accidental releases  depends on adherence to the safe procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAgrium U.S. Inc. Sacramento Nitrogen Operations is situated on the eastern central edge of Yolo County, southwest of the main portion of the City of West Sacramento in the Port of Sacramento Industrial Park, on the Sacramento River Deep-Water Ship Channel.  The facility functions as a chemical distribution center and a chemical manufacturing facility.  The facility is a distribution center for anhydrous ammonia throughout California.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site by ship and rail-car and distributed from the site by truck and rail-car.  The facility manufactures two fertilizers; urea-ammonium nitrate solution (UAN-32) and ammonium nitrate solution (AN-20).  The process operations at the facility that use anhydrous ammonia are:\r\n\r\n1)     Anhydrous ammonia is received by ship and rail-car for storage and distribution by rail-car and truck.\r\n\r\n2)     Anhydrous ammonia is used to refrigerate the anhydrous ammonia in the atmospheric storage tanks.\r\n\r\n3)     Anhydrous ammonia and air are used to produce nitri"

Administrative & Engineering Controls\r\n\r\nAdministrative and engineering controls are in place to prevent accidental releases. Additional controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia if an accidental release were to occur.  These controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the equipment, processes and systems that use anhydrous ammonia and the training provided to the operators of these processes and systems.\r\n\r\n3b.  Mitigation Measures\r\n\r\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of anhydrous ammonia released to a minimum if a release were to occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the processes and systems that use anhydrous ammonia and their related equipment and components.\r\n\r\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program is one part of a comprehensive loss control program implemented at the facility for the anhydrous ammonia processes and systems. The implementation of PSM, safety related administrative procedures (Manufacturing Management System / Environment, Health, Safety & Security Excellence Management System) and Safe Work Practices represent the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n5.

The equipment, process, and training modifications made to the plant to ensure the June 2nd, 2010 event does not occur again are complete. These are described in sub-section 7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety below.   \r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe details of the Emergency Response Program for the anhydrous ammonia processes at the plant are contained within the West Sacramento Emergency Manual which contains all of the emergency response program elements.  It is intended to be a compliance, reference, training guide, and field guide for emergency response actions based on the chemical involved.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates procedures for alerting personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of West Sacramento Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location, if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Yolo County - Office of Emergency Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee. The program also includes procedures for notification of outside emergency responders, appropriate agencies and immediate neighbors in the event of a release. The plant has an emergency response team on site at all times, trained in accordance with the HAZWOPER regulation, 29 CFR 120. The plant conducts emergency internal drills and joint drills with the Fire Department.\r\n\r\n7.

      "SummaryText": "stem captures ammonia vapor: \r\n        o   sniffer (concentration), \r\n        o   absolute pressure, and \r\n        o   differential pressure.\r\n   \u00bf\tPilot valve vapor sensing line car-sealed open (this alone mitigates the risk of an incident of the kind that\r\n        occurred on 6/2/2010).\r\n   \u00bf\tNon-Pilot-operated valves are car-sealed shut and used only during maintenance on the Pilot-operated PSV's.\r\n   \u00bf\tImproved sensor reliability in Plant: more sensors, increased Planned Maintenance\r\n   \u00bf\tNew neighborhood siren \r\n   \u00bf\tNew email/text/phone alert system\r\n   \u00bf\tCreated shelter-in-place training video and distributed to neighbors\r\n   \u00bf\tEnsure MOC process strictly followed; conducted MOC audit and annual MOC refresher training. \r\n   \u00bf\tUpdated procedures and enhanced training. \r\n   \u00bf\tImproved response drills and equipment.  \r\n\r\nOther changes since the previous RMP submission:\r\n   \u00bf\tInstallation of ammonia sensors at truck and rail loading areas. \r\n   \u00bf\tAutomated water deluge at loading areas.\r\n   \u00bf\tLoading pressure-dependent shut-down valves.\r\n   \u00bf\tDuplicate flow meters (truck-loading).\r\n   \u00bf\tSmart-Hoses (with breakaway EFV's).\r\n   \u00bf\tRefinement of administrative programs; Manufacturing Management System / Environment, Health, Safety & Security\r\n        Excellence Management System.\r\n   \u00bf\tAdditionally, Agrium is continually evaluating and applying existing systems as a commitment to on-going safety\r\n        enhancements."
