Its emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to its facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68 Prevention Program procedures and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program.\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of 10,583 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to the air from a high-pressure receiver. \n\nThe worst-case anhydrous ammonia release rate estimated at 1,058.3 pounds per minute.\nThe modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of anhydrous ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14 ppm), because of a 10-minute release of 10,583.3 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, is 0.9 miles. \n\nClean Air Act regulations require that the alternative release scenario selection is more probable than the worst-case scenario. The scenario selected involves a refrigeration seal failure or a vessel puncture. This could be the result of a"

This failure results in the release of the entire containerA?s contents over a period of 30 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 114 pounds of ammonia per minute inside the building and 5.7 pounds of ammonia per minute to the outside air.\n\nThe modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of anhydrous ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14 ppm), because of a 30-minute release of 3,420 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, is 0.1 miles. \n\nTexas Pack, Inc. must prepare a five-year accident history in its RMP. This will help in the prevention of future accidents. There have been no reportable accidents at the Texas Pack, Inc. facility in the last five years.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program 3 requirements and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBA) that operators wear during connection/disconnection of ammonia, and staff awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of ammonia.\n\nTexas Pack, Inc. maintains safety information on its equipment used in the ammonia refrigeration process. This written information allows Texas Pack, Inc. and its employees to accurately conduct a process hazard analysis.\n\nTexas Pack, Inc. established a Process Hazard team to identify equipment, operating procedures, and conditions where the potential exists for employee exposure and environmental hazards associated with ammonia refrigeration.\n\nTexas Pack, Inc. has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities associated with the ammonia process.
