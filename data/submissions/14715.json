Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this facility, we handle chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide which are considered hazardous by EPA.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these hazardous chemicals combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use in the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce and bleach pulp.\n\n7 Chlorine is received in liquid form by underground pipeline from a large off-site storage facility, owned and operated by Occidental Chemical                                                                                                                 \n7 Sulfur Dioxide is received and stored in liquid form.  It is received by rail car. \n7 Chlorine Dioxide is stored in a solution of water.  The large dilution factor of the chemical reduces its potential to harm personnel in relation to the other chemicals which are in gaseous forms.  The system is in a localized area which minimizes the potential to effect as large a number of people in relations to the two preceding chemicals.\n\n3.
