This plant is one of two sites that Clean Harbors operates in the Deer Park Area.  Clean Harbors has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to TSD plant.  Only the 2027 Independence Parkway South Plant operations and policies are presented in this RMP *eSubmit Plan.\n\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\nThe Clean Harbors Deer Park Plant accidental release prevention policies involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, equipment, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Act's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program, (PSM) 29 CFR-1910-119, of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The OSHA program is similar to the EPA's RMP prevention program and EPA emergency response program.\nClean Harbors provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and RMP safety and prevention programs as outlined in our Employee Participation policy and procedure.  Clean Harbors also provides a variety of technical documents beyond the RMP and PSM-required policies and procedures.   The documents are used to maintain safe operation of the processes and include chemical handling instructions. \n1.1.\tPREDICTIVE FILING (A) (1)\nThe plant is a treatment storage and disposal site that uses incineration for treatment (destruction) of the hazardous waste streams we are permitted to treat.  Because of the nature of this operation we use predictive filing since there is a potential for"

      "SummaryText": "the chemicals described below to be present at the plant. \nThese chemicals will occasionally be stored at the facility in quantities exceeding the threshold planning quantities. \nAll potential HHCs and their RMP maximum intended inventory are listed below in Section #2.  An evaluation of all the PSM and RMP chemicals on site is determined on a daily basis. The daily evaluation is a conservative estimate of the quantity of each chemical.  It's based on the maximum amount of that chemical in each waste stream.  Cooperating local response agencies are informed of the complete predictive RMP list and upon request, the actual facility inventories are provided.  \n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nClean Harbors has a management system in place which is led by the plant General Manager.  The Clean Harbors Safety Manager and Compliance Manager oversee the execution and on-going implementation of the RMP as well as the like PSM elements.  This program, along with other plant-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information and a copy is attached to this RMP*eSubmital.\n1.3.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nClean Harbors maintains policies, procedures, systems and staff that are an integral part of our prevention program.  These are applied to each process in our plant operations.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained by the Clean Harbors Treatment Plant Document Management System (DMS).\n\n2.\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED (B)  \nClean Harbors operates a treatment storage and disposal hazardous waste incinerator system for the destruction of liquid and solid waste products.  \n2.1.\tSITE DESCRIPTION (B)"

The location of one of the tank truck chemical off-loading operations within the plant is Lat 29.731303, Long -95.095424 and our EPA ID number is: 100000059107.\nThe boundaries of the highly hazardous chemical system subject to the RMP regulation include the bulk rail car off-loading area, the tank truck off-loading area, both are adjacent to the tank farm used to store these chemicals.  There is also a bulk direct burn area that can handle several tank truck trailers at a time as well as three Glove Box areas use to direct burn drums, cylinders, and tote bins of various hazardous chemicals.  The plant also has a large warehouse area for storage of containerized hazardous chemicals.  Standard containers vary from lab pack items, one, five, 30, 55 gallon drums and tote bins up to 320 gallon in .  The final boundary of the RMP process is when the material is oxidized in the various combustion chambers of or incineration systems.  All of the systems are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP PSI files.  Feeding of the kiln is directed by the operations group from a central control room located between the bulk liquid storage area and the kiln feed areas. \n2.1.1.\tRegulated substance (b) (2)\nHighly hazardous chemicals including both flammable and toxics may be on site that exceed the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule's threshold quantities.  The TSD operates under permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  Hazardous waste streams include highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) that are received, stored and disposed of by incineration in Clean Harbors kiln treatment process systems. \nHighly hazardous chemicals are EPA-listed toxic or flammable chemicals.

Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the Clean Harbors plant.  All employees who work with hazardous waste receive initial and annual HazWoper training as well as all required RMP training.\nThe Contingency Plan/Emergency Response Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to highly hazardous chemical spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all faclity operators and maintenance staff.  The primary response team includes our trained certified employees, the Harris County, Deer Park Harris County Fire and Rescue, and county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to any severe highly hazardous chemical leak situation.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.

Other recommended actions have recently been completed based on the 2009 PHA and compliance audit as directed by the RMP program to meet requirements and make the plant safer.  The 2010 PHA recommended actions include 28 action items.  These have now been evaluated and are in the process of being resolved as required.  An internal compliance audit was conducted in 2009 of the PSM and RMP program.  Key safety action items were completed.  See \"Update\" Section 6 of the Audit Report.  \nClean Harbors continually develops new and reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the Clean Harbors plant management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the hazardous waste chemical operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of any hazardous chemicals including all RMP HHCs.\n  \n7.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n(Note:  This section is not required.
