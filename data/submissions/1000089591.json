The regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration system that provides cooling of cold storage of food products.\r\nThe maximum intended inventory at the facility is approximately 22,304 pounds of ammonia used as a refrigerant within a closed system. The system, consists of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and freezer storage and dock operations.\r\nAs part of this analysis, the emergency response planning guidelines concentration level 2 (ERPG-2) was used as a toxic endpoint to quantify off-site impact for the facility. The ERPG-2 was developed to provide estimates of concentration ranges within which adverse health effects can be observed. Table 1-1 summarizes the maximum downwind distances at the ERPG-2 and the estimated populations that are at risk to being exposed to the ERPG-2 concentration for each release. The at risk population numbers are the estimated number of people within the radius of the maximum downwind distance reached by the plume in all wind directions.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFor\r\n\r\nLlano Logistics, L.P.\r\n200 Freedom Drive\r\nRoanoke, TX 76262\r\n\r\nPrepared By:\r\n\r\nINNOVATIVE REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS, INC.\r\n373 Mt.

The ammonia refrigeration cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization for cooling.  The refrigeration system utilizes these phenomenons to remove heat from a desired area, and then to discard that heat, through condensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\r\n\r\nThe Llano Logistics, L.P. facility utilizes ammonia refrigeration to cool various storage areas.  The refrigeration system contains the following equipment:  one high pressure thermosyphon receiver, one high temperature recirculator, one low temperature recirculator, four screw compressors, one evaporative condenser, and thirteen evaporators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n Every section of the PSM/RMP program must allow for employee participation in its development and implementation.
