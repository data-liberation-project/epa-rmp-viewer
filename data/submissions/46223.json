If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Elbow Lake Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery to the farm for application.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 345,050 lbs. in one 26,000 and one 18,000 gallon tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 114,000 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank?s capacity, as limited by design standards.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be 1.14 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1.  We also use OSHS ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia? standards for training.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nElbow Lake Coop Grain has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA 29CFR1910.111.  This is coordinated with the local authorities."
