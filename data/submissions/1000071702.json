Corporate Commitment\n\n\n\nGemstone Ventures Florence, LLC (GVF) is committed to responsible environmental stewardship, protection of the community, employee health and safety, and product safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, and acceptance of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes.\n\n\n\nGVF's corporate commitment to safety extends to processes covered by the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP).  GVF's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Accordingly, GVF's Florence facility has developed management systems to prevent the release of regulated substances, especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  The management systems were developed taking into consideration the applicable governmental regulations as well as the systematic evaluation of the facility's process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\n\n\n2.     Background Data \n\n\n\nGVF processes poultry by deboning, sizing, marinating, and freezing poultry parts and pieces.  This facility provides more than 300 jobs to the local community.  GVF is submitting this RMP in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) as promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nGVF is committed to complying with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\n\nIf a release occurs, GVF's personnel will assist local emergency responders to mitigate the consequ"

Management systems at the Florence facility have been developed in such a way that hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\n4.    Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nAdequate refrigeration is mandated for the food processing areas of the plant by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Anhydrous ammonia, an industry standard refrigerant for poultry processing plants, is utilized as a refrigerant to maintain the facility's food processing areas within the required range of operating temperatures.  The facility's plantwide refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping.  The system stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Accordingly, the facility's plantwide refrigeration system is a Program 3 process as defined by the risk management program rule (40 CFR Part 68). \n\n\n\n5.    Release Scenario\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, GVF evaluated the offsite consequences of the release of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst-case scenario and an alternate case scenario were developed.\n\n\n\n6.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, GVF has implemented precautionary measures.  These precautionary measures comply with OSHA's PSM regulations and were evaluated and engineered to prevent and mitigate potential anhydrous ammonia releases.  Example of some of the controls installed to prevent a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia are vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, manual and automatic shutoffs, ammonia leak detection systems, and electrical distribution system grounding.  In addition, GVF has trained employees to operate, identify, and respond in the event of a release.  These employees are part of the Process Safety Team (PST).\n\n\n\nGVF has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigerat"

Safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and will be reviewed annually by a SOP review team.\n\n\n\nGVF encourages employee participation in the development of control measures used at the facility through regularly scheduled PST meetings.  Any changes to existing procedures will be communicated to affected employees following written Management of Change (MoC) procedures.  GVF understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  Therefore, GVF has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is managed and documented to ensue that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  Additionally, testing on pipe headers and vessels will be conducted to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that GVF's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the facility, regularly scheduled audits will be performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) program, GVF will conduct detailed PSM compliance audits in accordance with state and federal Law.\n\n\n\nThe following audits will be conducted by outside agencies:\n\n \n\nLocal Fire Department Audits - Annually\n\nUSDA Audits - Randomly\n\nFacility Insurance Carrier - Randomly\n\n\n\n7.    Five Year History  \n\n\n\nThe facility was previously operated by Hillshire Brands Company, Florence Facility (RMP1000035537).  The facility was closed by Hillshire and was idle for more than three (3) years; therefore, GVF is filing this RMP as a new facility.\n\n\n\n8.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation and response as well as for n"

In addition, the facility has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection, and testing of systems, as well as instructions and training.\n\n \n\n\n\n9.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is a mature industry employing known technology.  GVF employees remain abreast of current innovations that improve safety.  GVF is a member of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and relies upon other sources, such as the Garden City Ammonia Training Program, to provide professional input.  This involvement enables GVF's employees to learn and implement modern safety system improvements as they emerge within the ammonia refrigeration industry.\n\n"
