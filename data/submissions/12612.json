      "SummaryText": "LONE CAMP RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\nand contain the release.\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant, located 3 miles west of Lone Camp on Highway 3137 (across from the\npower plant on Lake Palo Pinto) in Palo Pinto County, Texas, produces natural gas liquids from\nnatural gas. These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of ethane, propane and butane. The\nplant also treats natural gas liquids to remove CO2. Some of the chemicals produced or used\ninclude methane, ethane, propane, butane, ethylene glycol and diethanolamine.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Lone Camp gas plant above the EPA Threshold\nQuantity. The threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical\nwhich if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program\nregulations. Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold\nquantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane and butane.\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 30,000 gallon storage tank containing natural\ngas liquids. Assuming the material in the tank is primarily propane, the distance away from the\nplant affected in this worst-case sce"

      "SummaryText": "nario would be approximately 0.42 miles, based on EPA\nanalysis. \n\nA more probable release scenario would involve the release of natural gas condensate from a\ntransfer line during unloading. Based on the pump capacity of approximately 150 gallons/minutes\n(9000 gallons in one hour), we would release approximately 1500 gallons in 10 minutes, at which\ntime our operators or the truck driver would detect and isolate the leak. The affected distance\nbased on EPA guidance is approximately 0.15 miles, or approximately 780 feet. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based\non the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain\nsafe operation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all\nchemicals on-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all\nvessels and equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with\nwritten procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure\nthat safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated\nwith the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined\nto identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\nwhat-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are\nconducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.\nThis team identifies and evaluates haz"

All approved recommendations from the\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\nappropriate, the Lone Camp gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis\nresults. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations. These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\nas current and accurate.\n\n\nTraining\n\nOur employees at the Lone Camp plant have an average experience of over 10 years. This level of\nexperience provides a great level of expertise throughout the facility. Ongoing training is\naccomplished through routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new processes and refresher\ntraining on operating procedures. \n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of\nincreased maintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety\nand health hazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their\nbeginning work. In addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance\nduring the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor\nperformance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our\nequipment in a safe opera"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the\nequipment back in service or they will determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe\noperation of the equipment.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has long-standing safe work practices to help ensure worker and\nprocess safety. Examples of these include lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for\nequipment that is being worked on, a permit and procedure for hot work and a permit and\nprocedure for confined space entry. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected\npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed\nsafely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered\nprocesses. This system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals,\ntechnology (including operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly\nreviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate\ncontrols are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been\ncompromised by the change.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to\nprevention of accidental releases of specific regulated substances in the facility.\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n(2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of\nsafety features are used in the covered process\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.    Hydrocarbon detection sensors around the facility perimeter.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.    Process relief valves to prevent vessel overpressure.\n2.    Valves (both manual and automatic) to permit isolation of the process.\n3.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (such as high pressure or\n      high level in a vessel).\n4.    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.    Fire extinguishing systems. We have numerous fire extinguishers of several sizes\n      throughout the facility. In gas plants, the control of fire is more dependent on restricting\n      sources of fuel than on putting out the fire.\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Lone Camp plant has not had an incident over the past five years which has impacted off-site\npeople or structures.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to\nprotect worker and public safety. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release,\nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. \n\nIn addition, the Lone Camp gas plant"

The facility recently had a simulated emergency drill with the local\nemergency planning coordinator of Palo Pinto County and local emergency response agencies.\nNot only did we learn more about their capability, but they became more familiar with our\noperations and how to respond in case of an incident.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility\ncontinually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. Our\ncompany is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies\nand our facility personnel. Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency\nresponders is an integral part of our operations."
