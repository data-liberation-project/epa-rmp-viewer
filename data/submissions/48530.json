Box 399\nLockport, LA 70374\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n2004 Update\n\n\nExecutive Summary:  South Treatment Plant\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your site\n\nDue to new regulations under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the District has developed a Risk Management Plan for chlorine gas.  The requirements involve instituting a prevention plan to avoid unnecessary chlorine leaks in addition to revising its existing emergency response procedure.  The expectations of the above mentioned requirements are to allow minimal injury and damage to occur, as well as to provide aid and guidance for other responders in the event of an accident.\n\nThe prevention plan, developed by the District, has been designed to ensure that all precautions are taken so as to prevent and mitigate any possible chlorine release.  One element of this plan is to assess the chlorine process for potential hazards that could contribute to a leak then correct the problems immediately.  Another essential component is written operating procedures for all duties associated with chlorine, while another is to provide proper training to employees involved in those duties.  From now on, all training and inspection information will be documented for future reference.\n\nThe revised emergency response plan has been implemented with the intention that plant personnel will respond, contain and repair all chlorine leaks.  One reason for this is because we feel our employees are properly trained and experienced enough to resolve the problem in a timely manner.  Another reason is because plant policy allows chlorine cylinders to be handled only during normal working hours. Consequently most releases will occur at this time while enough qualified people are present to initiate a response.  Nonetheless, it is possible to have a release after hours, but because two people are on site at all times they will be able mitigate the situation. \n\n\n"

South Treatment Plant is located on LA Highway 308 just north of Lockport.  The physical address is 5753 Highway 308, Lockport. \n\n2.    Background Information:    \nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1 ? South Treatment Plant is a potable drinking water production facility.  The District purifies water taken from Bayou Lafourche and distributes the water to customers throughout Lafourche Parish.\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process and is fed continuously.  The District has one (1) ton chlorine cylinders on site.  Plant personnel remove the one (1) ton cylinders when empty and replace them with full cylinders.  This involves transporting cylinders with a forklift, lifting the cylinders with a hoist, and mounting a regulator onto the cylinder valve.  These chlorine cylinders are only replaced during normal working hours due to safety concerns.      \nDistrict personnel can deal with most emergency response and repair situations; nonetheless, outside assistance may be necessary depending on the severity of the leak.  ?A? and ?B? repair kits, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and extra air bottles are stored in an emergency response and repair cart, which is available for quick response.  Containment suits and gloves can also be found in the cart.   \nSugarcane and pastureland surround the plant on three sides with LA Highway 308 on the other.  The closest residence is located across Bayou Lafourche approximately 900 feet west of the plant.\n\n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n1.    General:\nThe following information represents general prevention program policies to prohibit unnecessary chlorine leaks.\n1)    Safety information documented and distributed to employees\n2)    Properly designed chlorination equipment\n3)    Hazard review conducted\n4)    Written operating procedures\n5)    Per"

We feel this is due to having employees who are well trained and very competent in the duties in which they are involved.\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned, the goal of our emergency response program is to effectively respond to chlorine leaks allowing minimal injury or damage to occur.  It will also aid other emergency response personnel by providing guidance in the event of an accident.  Some of the elements of this plan are referenced below.\n\nAlarm:\nA chlorine leak detector sounds an alarm when elevated chlorine concentrations are found.

The details of both are provided in the ?Chlorine - Emergency Response? SOP (attachment 6.74).  As stated in the previous section, the ranking supervisor will initiate the Code Response.  \nThe code yellow response will normally be initiated for small leaks (less than 10 pounds) and unknown leaks.  This situation may or may not require the emergency response cart, but it will be prepared for use regardless.  The purpose of the Code Yellow response is to attempt to diagnose the problem and/or rectify the situation by closing valves.\nThe code red response will be utilized when a leak is known to be greater than 10 pounds and/or the repair kit is needed to correct the situation.\nA personal protective equipment SOP is provided in RMP.  \n    \n\nAfter Hours:\nPurification department day workers normal working hours are 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday; otherwise, there are two people operating the plant at all times.  Plant policy allows handling of chlorine cylinders only during normal working hours in order that sufficient workers are present in case an emergency response is initiated.  If an emergency situation arises after hours, the man on standby and any other supervisor available shall be contacted and notified of the situation.  These supervisors shall report to the plant immediately to assist in the Emergency Response.  The ranking supervisor will use discretion when calling on outside assistance, although he is required to notify specific agencies if a chlorine leak threatens to have offsite impact or exceeds a ten- (10) pound release. \n\n\nOutside Assistance:  (Offsite Impact or 10 pound chlorine leak)\nWhen a chlorine leak threatens to have an offsite impact or is known to be greater than 10 pounds, the ranking supervisor is required to contact the following agencies:\nLaf.

Generally, a major chlorine release will last at most 30-40 minutes, therefore, shelter in place will more than likely be used in an emergency situation.  If shelter-in-place is initiated, all air conditioning must be shut off, and all vents, windows, and doors closed.  In addition, office personnel shall keep customers from leaving during this time.  Office personnel should listen for further advisories.\nOffice personnel will be prepared to evacuate the premises on short notice.  Evacuation will be utilized if there is a massive quantity of chlorine released or if the wind direction threatens the assembly area. \n\n\nPublic Notification:\nIf outside assistance is required, the Sheriffs Office, State Police, and the Fire Department will be notified. Evacuation or shelter-in-place of residences will be at the discretion of the Law Enforcement Agencies. These agencies may choose to shelter residences within ? mile of the plant.  If so, residences should be instructed to shut windows, close any ventilation system, and listen for further advisories.\n\n\nPhone Answering:      \nDuring normal working hours, the front office will answer telephone calls, whereas, after hours, any available personnel will do so.\n\n\nMedia Inquiry:\nThe media will be updated by one person who is authorized to do so at the appropriate time.
