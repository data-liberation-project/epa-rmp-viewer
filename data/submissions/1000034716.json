      "SummaryText": "Axiall, LLC Aberdeen PVC plant has a long history of safe operation in the Aberdeen community.  Our employees work hard every hour, every day to provide a safe workplace for themselves while protecting the environment inside and outside our fences.      \n\n\n\nPLANT INFORMATION\n\nThe Aberdeen plant produces polyvinyl chlorine (PVC or vinyl) resins and compounds.  These materials are used in downstream operations to produce wire and cable insulation, vinyl siding, pipe, packaging, and numerous other similar products .  The resins and compounds are produced by the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  After the polymerization, the resin is dried and stored for shipping.  Most of the VCM used in the process is shipped by rail from Georgia Gulf's Louisiana operations.  The VCM is a gas at normal conditions, but is kept under pressure and handled as a liquid, in a similar manner to propane.  At certain concentrations the VCM is flammable, therefore the plant has many safety systems in place.  Both the Flammable Chemical Vinyl Chlorine Monomer and the Toxic Chemical Chlorine, which isused as a water treatment additive, have been addressed in the RMP Plan preparation.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nIn calculating the \"worst-case\" scenario for flammable chemicals, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requires the following assumptions be made:\n\nCatastrophic (complete) failure of the largest storage vessel\n\nComplete loss of the contents of the vessel and vaporization of the liquid in ten minutes\n\nMixing of sufficient air with the vapors to generate an explosion with a 10 percent yield-the worst seen for mixture of flammable vapors with air\n\nNone of the plant's procedures or emergency systems work\n\nIgnition of the vapor cloud as soon as all the material vaporizes\n\n\n\nThe impact of these \"worst-case\" events decreases as you move away from the facility.  It is important to understand the standard measure of impact for determining the impacted zones.  These limits are devel"

For flammable releases, the company is required to define the impacted areas within which one would see a shock wave of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure, or in other words a wave significant enough to cause damage such as shattering of windows and partial demolition of houses.\n\n\n\nThe likelihood of a \"worst-case\" scenario is extremely remote and is of limited value for planning purposes.  This scenario defines the largest possible impacted zone.\n\n\n\nVCM is unloaded from railcars and is stored in a spherical tank.  The capacity of this vessel is 6 million pounds of VCM.  If the vessel was completely full, ruptured, none of the safety systems functioned properly, it was a hot day and all the liquid vaporized in ten minutes, the atmospheric conditions provided sufficient oxygen without dispersing the vapor cloud, a spark set off an explosion, and the maximum explosive yield was generated, the off-site area impacted would consist of circle, centered in the processing unit, with a radius of 1.1 miles.\n\n\n\nIn calculating the \"worst-case\" scenario for toxic gases, the EPA requires the assumption that the total quantity in the single largest vessel or process line (passive mitigation measures may be taken into account) is released as a gas over a period of ten minutes.  In the \"worst-case\" scenario for the toxic chemical chlorine, a scenario in which the entire contents of a  one-ton cylinder was released.  Assuming the length of the release is 10 minutes, the off-site area impacted would consist of a circle, centered at the utlities area, with a radius of 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOther release scenarios are also required to be considered.  The \"alternate-case\" scenarios generally involve smaller releases and take into account the mitigating ability of safety systems in determining the extent of impact.  The Aberdeen Plant's \"alternate-case\" VCM scenario assumes that an 8-inch pipe"

To accomplish this goal, our emergency preparedness efforts focus on four areas:\n\n\n\nPersonnel - The most important part of any response plan is well trainined, qualified people such as Axiall's Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The team consists of employees from various departments within the plant.  They train annually at places such as the Mississippi State Fire Academy.  On-site training is conducted regularly to test and refine the skills acquired at those facilities.  The ERT members have specialized training in fire fighting, hazardous materials handling, confined-space rescue and medical training.\n\n\n\nResources - The proper equipment is a necessary requirement for any job.  In the field of emergency response, it is necessary that equipment, materials, and labor be available immediately as needed.  The Aberdeen facility is equipped with such items as chemical transportation response equipment, automatically activated fire water systems, portable fire water monitors, fire fighting gear, fire extinguishers and other necessary equipment.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is hoped they will never be necessary, Axiall, LLC has provided sirens to alert the community to off-site emergencies.
