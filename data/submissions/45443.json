To that end we are committed to RMP as a means to support this mission and continue to improve ourselves. Our program focuses upon operating procedures as the core of safe operation. These procedures are the result of  hazard assessments and process hazard analysis. The plant to manufacture our products is underpinned by a mechanical integrity program to ensure our equipment is maintained and operated consistent with industry guidelines.\n\nThose who operate the equipment for epichlorohydrin undergo a rigorous in-house training and certification program. Our engineers, chemists and operators have over 40 years of combined experience with this material.\n\nProcess changes or modifications undergo a specific management of change program and start up reviews. All incidents, of which we have never had one, are subject to our investigation process. We utilize a contractor screening process and use hotwork permits to ensure safety and quality of work.\n\nWe have coordinated our emergency response activity with local responding agencies and have retained a Hazmat emergency response organization to support us as a contingency to our emergency response program."
