THE BUHLER FACILITY HAS 2 TANKS (ONE 30,000 GALLON AND ONE 12,000 GALLON) WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 184,000 POUNDS.  THE TANKS ARE DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR TANKS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUESTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 132,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.50 MILES AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 1536 AREA CITIZENS. \n\n THIS COMPANY'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRAIN ITS EMPLOYEES IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON A REGULAR BASIS.   THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF THE TYPICAL FACILITY.  THE EMPLOYEEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  ABOVE ALL, THEY MAKE SURE TO HAVE CLEAN SAFETY WATER ON HAND DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.   OUR SAFETY RECORD ALLOWS US TO PROUDLY REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURY ACCIDENTS AT THIS PLANT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WILL BE OUR FIRST RESPONDER AND HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICE TO THIS COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
