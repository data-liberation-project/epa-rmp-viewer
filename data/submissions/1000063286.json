              "Description": "CHAPTER 2\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1    EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP employees were actively involved in the development of the PSM.  The starting point for the PSM is an in-depth look at the current chemical storage and delivery systems used.  This study is required by OSHA, and is called a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  A PHA was performed for the facility in July 2014. The PHA report (and all other safety information) is available for review by employees at the facility.  The full PHA report is included in Appendix A.    \n\n\n\nThe safety committee at the plant includes all operators, and holds an annual training meeting to review safety information including the PHA, RMP, and PSM.  Any new PHAs performed will include plant employees in the process.  The PSM, RMP, and PHA documents are maintained at the plant, and are available for employees to review.\n\n\n\n2.2    PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nA.    Chemical Information.  \n\n\n\n1.    Chlorine (CAS #7782-50-5).  The JRSB WWTP uses one-ton and 150-lb. cylinders to store chlorine as a liquefied gas.  A contractor delivers chlorine to the site in either the one-ton or 150-lbs. cylinders.  Liquefied chlorine presents a health risk if the container or the lines delivering chlorine develop leaks or rupture. Unloading truck shipments, moving from storage to on-line positions and opening or closing valves are operations that increase the risk of a chlorine release.  \n\n\n\nA liquid chlorine spill will quickly become a gas cloud and diffuse to the surrounding area. Because chlorine is heavier than air, it may collect in still, low-lying areas. The quantity released, the release rate, weather conditions, and the topography determine the speed and direction of spread of the chlorine. \n\n\n\n2.    Hazards of Chlorine.  Chlorine is a toxic gas at low air concentrations.  OSHA has established a ceiling concentration, the value never to be exceeded, of 1 part per million (ppm) in air.  The primary health risks from chlorine are respiratory and eye irritation and lung damage.  The OSHA Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) of 1 ppm has been set to reduce irritation of the nose, throat, and eyes of exposed workers.  Also, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has established a Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 0.5 ppm.  Individuals can begin to smell chlorine at about 0.3 ppm.  The level that is Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) is 25 ppm.\n\n\n\na.    Toxicity.  Toxic gas.\n\n\n\nb.    PEL.  1-ppm (3 mg/m3) ceiling.\n\n\n\nc.    Physical Data.  Yellow-green gas.  Stored as liquid under pressure.  Boils at  34A?C.  Vapor Pressure of 4800 mm Hg at 20A?C.  Evaporates rapidly to form a gas cloud.  Forms a white precipitate in the presence of ammonia.\n\n\n\nd.    Reactivity.  Reacts with aluminum to release hydrogen gas.  Oxidizes organic materials and most metals.\n\n\n\ne.    Corrosivity.  Causes burns to skin and eyes. \n\n\n\nf.    Thermal and Chemical Stability.  Indefinite shelf life.  Do not store with alkalies, reducing agents, or organic materials.\n\n\n\ng.    Mixing Hazards. Explodes on contact with acetylene in the presence of heat.  Forms heat and a white precipitate on contact with ammonia.  May ignite on contact with metals.  Violently reacts with alcohols.\n\n\n\nB.    Process Description.\n\n\n\n1.    Block Flow Diagram.  See Figure 2-1. \n\n\n\n2.    Process Chemistry and Equipment.  Gaseous chlorine flows from the 1-ton steel cylinders in the Chlorine Building to the injector.  The gas is drawn out by venture action (vacuum suction) of flowing water, placing the chlorine gas directly in solution.  The resulting chlorinated water is added to the wastewater for disinfection.\n\n\n\nGaseous chlorine from the 150-lb, cylinders in the Sludge Treatment Building flows to an injector, which is also drawn out via venture action (vacuum suction), placing the chlorine gas in direct contact with the sludge.  This is done to control and neutralize gaseous odors from the sludge.\n\n\n\n3.    Maximum Intended Inventory. Chlorine is delivered in 2,000-lb. cylinders in the Chlorine Building and 150-lb. cylinders in the Sludge Treatment Building.  Up to eight 2,000-lb. cylinders may be stored in the Chlorine Building and ten 150-lb. cylinders at the Sludge Treatment Building. The maximum inventory at the site is 17,500 lbs. Chlorine is primarily consumed based on water flow.  \n\n\n\n4.    Safe Operating Limits.  The system is driven by the flowing action of the process water, and no over-pressurization of the chlorine system is possible due to the mechanical action of pumps.  The steel cylinders and chlorine delivery process piping will operate safely from a low temperature of 0oF to an upper temperature of 140oF.  The chemical storage and process rooms at the Chlorine and Sludge Treatment Buildings is ventilated and must not exceed 140oF.  \n\n\n\n5.    Consequences of Deviation.  Excess chlorine in the water leads to taste and odor complaints.  A rupture or leak in the supply lines will release chlorine gas in the plant.  Employees and residents downwind of the chlorine gas release have the potential for exposure. The PHA considers many different scenarios.  A complete copy of the PHA is included later in this report.\n\n\n\nC.    Process Equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.    Materials of Construction.  Both the 2,00-lb. and 150-lb. cylinders are made of steel.  Flexible alloy connectors, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping, or black iron pipes are used to transfer chlorine gas from the ton cylinders to the chorinators.  The chlorinators and ejectors are made from materials that do not corrode with chlorine exposure.  \n\n\n\n2.    Electrical Classification.  Chlorine is non-conductive and not explosive.  Electrical hazards have not been considered as applicable.  The loss of electrical power to the site does not increase the risk of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\n3.    Pressure Relief System.  The small diameter lines from the steel cylinders lead to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are equipped with a pressure relief valve that vents to the chlorine room.\n\n\n\n    4.    Ventilation System. A chlorine gas sensor in the chlorine room starts an alarm.  The exhaust ventilation system is started manually by a manual switch located outside the Chlorine Building door. When started, the exhaust system is designed to discharge chlorine away from the building. \n\n\n\n    5.    Codes and Standards Employed.  The facilities were designed to meet recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices at the time of construction.  \n\n\n\n    6.    Material and Energy Balance. All of the chlorine is consumed by either the water or sludge to form a chlorinated solution/mixture.  \n\n\n\n    7.    Safety Systems. An electronic chlorine gas detector is used to identify any leaks in the chlorine room.  The detector is set to respond when the chlorine concentration exceeds 0.5 ppm.  The sensor is connected to the chlorine gas detector, which is mounted on the wall in the non-potable room within the Chlorine Building.  If the sensor detects the presence of chlorine, an alarm sounds in the control room, and indicator lights go on at the chlorine gas detector in the non-potable room.\n\n\n\n    8.    A release of chlorine gas can be recognized in several ways:\n\n\n\nA?    a leak from a storage container makes a hissing sound\n\nA?    a greenish-yellow cloud can be seen\n\nA?    an odor can be sensed\n\nA?    an alarm from an air monitor can be heard\n\n\n\n    9.    When valves and connectors are examined using ammonia, a chlorine leak is detected by the appearance of a white vapor.  Receiving, moving and connecting chlorine cylinders are activities that present the greatest accidental release potential.\n\n\n\n2.3    PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe most current PHA was conducted in July 2014 and is contained as Appendix A of this plan.\n\n\n\n2.4    OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP maintains appropriate procedures for use to assure safe operation of the chemical delivery systems.\n\n\n\nA.    Operating Phases.  The different operating phases include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Initial Startup Procedures. The system is in use, so no written procedure for this phase is maintained.  If new equipment is added, a startup operating procedure will be developed.\n\n\n\n2.    Normal Operations Procedures.  A written procedure exists.\n\n\n\n3.    Temporary Operations Procedures. The system has redundant features and equipment, so no temporary operations with other equipment are necessary. If temporary equipment is added, a temporary operating procedure will be developed.\n\n\n\n4.    Emergency Shutdown Conditions. A written procedure exists.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Operations. The processes are not operated in an emergency.  After an emergency shutdown, off-site responders are called in to contain the problem.   After the site is safe, the system is placed back in normal operation.\n\n\n\n6.    Normal Shutdown Procedures. A written procedure exists.\n\n\n\n7.    Startup Procedures Following a Shutdown. A written procedure exists.\n\n\n\nIf new process equipment is installed at any facility, the operating procedures will be reviewed and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nB.    Information Contained.  The operating procedures include the following information:\n\n\n\nA?    operating limits\n\nA?    health and safety considerations\n\nA?    safety systems\n\nC.    Operating Procedure Accessibility.  The operating procedures for the processes are maintained at the appropriate facility.  These documents are accessible to employees.\n\n\n\nD.    Operating Procedure Review and Update.  When a change to the operating process, process chemicals, technology, equipment, or facilities occurs, the operating procedures will be reviewed to reflect current operating practice. The operating procedures are reviewed annually by the JRSB WWTP Executive Director.\n\n\n\nE.    Safe Work Practices.  Safe work practices concerning lockout/tagout, confined space entry, and plant operation are administered by the JRSB WWTP Executive Director.  These practices will provide for the control of hazards during normal operations.  \n\n\n\n2.5    TRAINING\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP has a training program which consists of initial training of new employees, and refresher training for all active employees. Training records for employees are kept at the JRSB WWTP.\n\n\n\nA.    Initial Training.  Initial training is required for all employees upon hire.  Each employee is trained before the first work assignment.  The training includes an overview of the process and operation procedures, and emphasizes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  A record of the training is kept at the facility.  \n\n\n\nB.    Refresher Training.  Refresher training is conducted at least once every three years for all current employees in order to ensure that the employee fully understands the current operation procedures for the specific process. \n\n\n\nC.    Training Documentation. The JRSB WWTP maintains a training record on site that identifies the employee, the date of training, and verification that the employee understood the training. \n\n\n\n2.6    CONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThis section applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to the chlorination process.  To help ensure that the employees and contractors are fully aware of the potential dangers involved, the responsibilities of both the employer and contractor are discussed below.\n\n\n\nA form used to help ensure compliance with this requirement is included in Appendix C.\n\n\n\nA.    JRSB WWTP Responsibilities.  The employer will take the following actions for any contractor:\n\n\n\n1.    Check the past safety performance and programs of the contractor.\n\n\n\n2.    Provide safety and hazard information on the process.\n\n\n\n3.    Ensure safe practices for controlling the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to the covered process area.\n\n\n\n4.    Verify that the contractor acts responsibly.\n\n\n\n5.    Perform a periodic evaluation of the performance of the contract employers in fulfilling their obligation.\n\n\n\n6.    Maintain a contract employee injury and illness log.\n\n\n\nB.    ContractorA?s Responsibilities.  The contractor will be responsible for the following:\n\n \n\n1.    Adequate training of employees in safety procedures.\n\n\n\n2.    Ensuring that contract employees know process hazards and applicable emergency actions.\n\n\n\n3.    Documentation of training, which shall include the name of the employee, the date of training, and verification that the employee understood the material presented.\n\n\n\n4.    Ensuring his employees follow facility safety procedures.\n\n\n\n5.    Informing the facility of any special safety hazards presented by the work they will perform.\n\n\n\n6.    Informing the facility of any special safety hazards they encounter during the work\n\n\n\n2.7    PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\n\n\nThis regulation applies only to new and modified facilities, and thus does not apply to the JRSB WWTP.  If significant changes are made to the chlorine system at any point in the future than a Pre-Startup Safety Review will be conducted by the JRSB WWTP Executive Director.  \n\n\n\n2.8    MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity of the chemical delivery equipment must be maintained in order to ensure it operates properly.  This is accomplished using a program of equipment inspection and employee training.\n\n\n\nA.    Equipment Inspection and Testing.  All equipment in the chemical delivery system is inspected and tested on a periodic basis.  Each inspection and test is documented.  This record identifies the date of the inspection or test, the name of the inspector, the identification number of the equipment, a description of the inspection method, and the results of the inspection.  Inspection results are maintained in the control room at the facility.  The form used to inspect the chlorine delivery system is shown in Appendix C.\n\n\n\nB.    Equipment Deficiencies and Replacement. The JRSB WWTP will correct deficiencies that pose a threat to the health and safety of the employees.  These corrections will be performed in a safe and timely manner and before further use of the equipment.  If the deficiency poses a life threatening risk, the JRSB WWTP will shut down the process until the necessary repairs have been completed.\n\n\n\nC.    Quality Assurance.  In maintenance of existing equipment, exact replacement parts will be used wherever possible.  Any part other than exact replacements will be governed by the Management of Change guidelines presented below.\n\n\n\n2.9    HOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nAny hot work performed on or near the covered process will be controlled by the use of a Hot Work Permit.  Hot work is defined as welding, brazing, soldering, cutting with a saw or torch, or grinding.\n\n\n\nThe permit shall be kept on file at the plant until the completion of the hot work operations.  A copy of the permit is contained in Appendix C.

      "SummaryText": "CHAPTER 1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1    BACKGROUND\n\n\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, in order to prevent or minimize the consequence of a catastrophic release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. The regulation requires a written plan to effectively communicate the hazards posed by processes involving hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe PSM regulations apply to any chemicals held in larger quantities than the \"threshold\" quantities identified in the regulations. The Joint Regional Sewerage Board Wastewater Treatment Plant ( JRSB WWTP) currently uses only one chemical in larger than the threshold quantity: chlorine (threshold quantity 1,500 pounds). A Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan addressing certain issues is required under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM plan must include the following topics: employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.\n\n\n\nThe OSHA PSM plan is directed at protecting the health and safety of the employees working around the covered chemical process.  The different parts of the PSM plan do not consider the possible off-site consequences of a problem with a covered chemical process.  An additional program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) addresses the off-site consequences of problems at facilities with a covered chemical process. This additional program is called the Risk Management Program (RMP) and is described in 40 CFR 68.  The information required for the RMP program is nearly identical to the information in the PSM, with one exception.  The RMP includes sections regarding the off-site consequences of a chemical release at a facility. \n\n\n\nThe JRSB"

      "SummaryText": " WWTP maintains this combined PSM/RMP plan to address the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the USEPA RMP program. \n\n\n\n1.2    APPLICABILITY\n\n\n\nAn obligation to comply with the PSM and the RMP regulations is incurred if a facility uses more than a threshold quantity of a covered chemical.  Each regulation contains a list of covered chemicals, and each chemical has a threshold quantity.  If a facility holds a listed chemical in a larger quantity than the threshold quantity, then the facility must have a PSM and RMP in place.  The list of chemicals covered, and threshold quantities, is very similar from the PSM to the RMP programs.   A significant difference between the programs involves the threshold quantity for chlorine.  \n\n\n\nPSM Threshold Quantity = 1,500 pounds (29 CFR 1910.119, Appendix A)\n\nRMP Threshold Quantity = 2,500 pounds (40 CFR 68.130, Table 1)\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP uses chlorine in quantities much larger than either threshold quantity shown above, so both PSM and RMP regulations apply.  This document includes all of the information required to describe both the PSM and RMP programs at the JRSB WWTP. All information required for the OSHA PSM program is listed first, in Chapter 2; the additional information for the USEPA RMP program follows in Chapter 3.  Recordkeeping requirements for each program are shown in a separate section near the end of the report.\n\n\n\n1.3    SITE DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP is located on Ecology Lane in West Haverstraw, New York.  The fenced facility uses chlorine to disinfect wastewater seasonally (May 15th through October 15th).  The chlorine is stored in steel cylinders, each holding either 2,000 pounds (1 ton) or 150 pounds (lbs.) of the liquefied gaseous chemical. The maximum inventory capacity at the site is nine 2,000-lb. cylinders in the Chlorine Building, but generally the JRSB WWTP keeps an operational inventory of no more than eight cylinders on site.  This equates to a maximum operational inventory of 17,500 lbs.\n\n\n\n"
