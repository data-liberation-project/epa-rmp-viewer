Hualapai Drive, maintains approximately 40,000-70,000 lbs of Chlorine on its premises at all times for the purposes of Wastewater Treatment.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant is staffed and monitored 24-hours/day, 7 days/week.\n  \nThe goal of the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) is to reduce the risk of accidental chemical releases that may result in injuries and/or incidents to the employees, public, environment and facilities/property.  The organization's management is committed to achieving and sustaining this goal.  The program complies with EPA Federal Regulation Part 68.150 through 68.190 (RMP) and the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM).\n\nSince the facility start-up (~10 years), there's been one accidental release of chlorine (within the past 6 months), resulting in two injuries.   The release did not require an evacuation and during the event, there was no risk to the public, environment or facility equipment.  Subsequent incident investigation activities occurred to address root cause/causal factors.  Incident learning\u00bfs are being shared, with intent to standardize across similar processes within the City of Scottsdale in an effort to continuously improve our Prevention Program. \n\nBelow is an overview of the Treatment Plant PSM/RMP Program components.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n1.1 Specific means of promoting employee participation and actively consulting with employees on matters of process safety are as follows: \n1.1.1 Process Hazard Analysis - All hazard analyses will include a representative from affected personnel and associated organizations throughout the City of Scottsdale (Fire, etc).  The basis for selecting employees will be determined by their involvement with the covered process.  \n1.1.2 Operating Procedures- The development of new operating procedures and the revision of existing procedures will involve th"
