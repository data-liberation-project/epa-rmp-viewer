Hualapai Drive, maintains approximately 40,000-70,000 lbs of Chlorine on its premises at all times for the purposes of Wastewater Treatment.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant is staffed and monitored 24-hours/day, 7 days/week.\n  \nThe goal of the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) is to reduce the risk of accidental chemical releases that may result in injuries and/or incidents to the employees, public, environment and facilities/property.  The organization's management is committed to achieving and sustaining this goal.  The program complies with EPA Federal Regulation Part 68.150 through 68.190 (RMP) and the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM).\n\nSince the facility start-up (~10 years), there's been one accidental release of chlorine (within the past 6 months), resulting in two injuries.   The release did not require an evacuation and during the event, there was no risk to the public, environment or facility equipment.  Subsequent incident investigation activities occurred to address root cause/causal factors.  Incident learning?s are being shared, with intent to standardize across similar processes within the City of Scottsdale in an effort to continuously improve our Prevention Program. \n\nBelow is an overview of the Treatment Plant PSM/RMP Program components.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n1.1 Specific means of promoting employee participation and actively consulting with employees on matters of process safety are as follows: \n1.1.1 Process Hazard Analysis - All hazard analyses will include a representative from affected personnel and associated organizations throughout the City of Scottsdale (Fire, etc).  The basis for selecting employees will be determined by their involvement with the covered process.  \n1.1.2 Operating Procedures- The development of new operating procedures and the revision of existing procedures will involve th"

All employees will be given the opportunity to comment on the training program through direct comments or written course evaluations.   \n1.1.4 Pre-Startup Safety Review - The pre-startup safety review team will consist of representatives from the technical operations disciplines, Safety, the contractors, and the construction organization, including at least one employee familiar with the covered process.  \n1.1.5 Mechanical Integrity - The development of new operating procedures and the revision of existing procedures will involve the employees operating or maintaining the covered process.  Any concerns or deficiencies raised by employees will be investigated and, when applicable, written changes will be made to the mechanical integrity program.   \n1.1.6 Management of Change - The management of change procedure pertains to the review of all proposed revisions to the site?s process systems, equipment, or operating procedures in order that these do not lead to an increased level of risk.  All levels of employees are involved in the change process, as it applies to the change. \n1.1.7 Incident Investigation ? All levels of employees will participate on teams investigating incidents related to the covered process.  The results of these investigations will be shared with all employees, when applicable/available.  \n1.1.8 Emergency Response - All employees involved in the covered process shall be made aware of the requirements of the Emergency Processes and Response Requirements.  \n1.1.9 Compliance Audit - During compliance audits, affected personnel will be interviewed to get feedback of their involvement and participation in the implementation of the PSM/RMP program and their accessibility to the documentation.  \n1.1.10 Employee Access to Information - All employees will be gi"
