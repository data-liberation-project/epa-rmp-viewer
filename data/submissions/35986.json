Headquartered in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, DOT is a family owned business that has grown from a single station wagon driven by the founder, Robert Tracy, to a fleet of over 400 multi-temp tractor trailers. This growth is in large part due to the customer driven attitude that is exhibited by all the members of the Dot team.  As stated on their website,  Dot Foods will continue to be driven by the values of integrity, growth, profit, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on innovation and employee welfare.\n\nDOT Foods' senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  DOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system has been in operation since 1991.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at Highway 99 South, Mount Sterling, Illinois 62353. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 28,600 pounds of ammonia for"

The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof, the water tank is located in the existing machine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the new and existing engine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.    In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condensers).  Ammonia sensors are located throughout the facility as follows:\nNew Engine Room (1), Existing Engine Room (1), Penthouses (4), Dock Area (10), Relief Header (1), Freezer Area (12), and Cooler Area(2).\n\nIn the event a sensor detects ammonia in the engine rooms, the detection system will alarm as follows:\nWarning: 35 ppm; Autodialer activates alarm light at control panel and office.\nAlarm: 150 ppm; Exhaust fans start.\nShutdown: 299 ppm; Compressor shutdown, King Valve closed, complete refrigeration shutdown, and audible alarm sounded throughout facility.\n\nIn the event a sensor detects ammonia in the freezer, cooler or dock areas, low alarm occurs at 10 ppm, medium alarm at 15 ppm, and high alarm at 25 ppm.  At high alarm, an audible alarm is sounded throughout the facility and all ammonia supply to affected areas is stopped.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Star"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.  \n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the DOT Foods Freezer Maintenance Operator (if he/she is present).  He/she will then use a portable radio to inform the Incident Commander (Facility Manager) and the other managers and contractors of the situation.\nThe DOT Foods on-duty engineer (Refrigeration Engineer if present) will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  The following agencies will be notified:\n\n1. Mt. Sterling Fire Department, Police Departments, and Illinois Highway Patrol; or call the Mt. Sterling Fire Department directly at 217-773-2341.\n\n2.  If an ammonia release exceeds 100 pounds (Federal Reportable Quantity CERCLA), call the National Response Center 1-800-424-8802 and the Illinois Emergency Agency at 800-782-7860.  The Brown County Emergency and Disaster can be contacted at 217-773-2886.\n\n3.  If additional help is required for an amm"

If an employee ingests ammonia, the Poison Control Center can be reached 24 hours per day at 800-342-9293.\n\n5.  If an ammonia release spills into the sewer system, storm drain or any type of water way, contact the Brown County Emergency and Disaster at  217-773-2113.\n\n6.  If an ammonia release is significant enough to potentially cause odor complaints from neighboring facilities, contact the Brown County Health Dept. at 217-773-2714 or the Springfield EPA at 217-782-3637.\n\n7.   If there is an accident that involves a fatality or if three or more people are hospitalized for injuries, call the local Peoria OSHA Office at 309-671-7033.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in July 2002, which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the DOT Foods facility located at Highway 99 South, Mount Sterling, Illinois.  DOT Foods' safety committee has completed all recommended items, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
