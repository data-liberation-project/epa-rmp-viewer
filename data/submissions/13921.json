Approximately 300 employees operate this 24 hour per day, 7 day a week facility, which processes natural fats and oils into intermediates for consumer products and industrial process use.  Our ingredients are used in hundreds of consumer products, including shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions, sun screens, fabric softeners, and household cleaners, as well as in many industrial processes as lubricants paper debonders, textile finishes, mining flotation reagents, asphalt emulsifiers, adhesives, curing agents, biocides, and blowing agents. \n\nWe also manufacture a product line of Metal Organic materials that are used in the manufacture of plastics.  The main products manufactured in the Metal Organics Plant are aluminum alkyls.  These products are pyrophoric in nature and require specialized equipment and procedures for safe handling.\n\nDISCUSSION:\n\nSeveral years ago, the plant constructed a 100-year flood protection dike to protect the plant property from serious floods.\n\nOn May 20, 1999, our plant joined with our neighboring facility al group lonza to present both plants Risk Management Plan to the Mapleton Community.  There were about 20 members from our plants present, 10 Mapleton Town Board members present and about 10 members from the Mapleton Community.  The plan was received well.  The event was covered by"

      "SummaryText": " the news media with a small article that appeared in the local paper the next day.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of our manufacturing processes that utilize those chemicals that fall under the EPA's RMP regulations.  The Mapleton production facilities fall under the Level 3 Processes.  The Mapleton Facility uses four Toxic Chemicals and two flammable chemicals that fall into this program.  The Toxic Chemicals are: Acrylonitrile, Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, and Methyl Chloride.  Our Flammable materials are Ethylene and Ethyl Chloride.\n\nThe values shown in the following scenarios were obtained using computer based modeling with EPA's RMP-Comp,Ver.1.06.  The community population numbers were obtained using Landview III, from the Census Bureau.  There are many more complicated programs available that should be used for emergency planning but RMP-Comp can be used for the planning for this document.\n\nWorst Case Scenario / TOXIC:\nThe Worst Case Scenario involves the potential release of 44,950 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes.  This chemical is released onto concrete.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Potential public receptors include the Village of Mapleton residents, Mapleton School employees and students, Mapleton Christian School employees and students, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Kingston Mines residents, Commonwealth Edison Powerton employees, algroup Lonza employees, Caterpillar employees, MG Industries employees, CF Industries employees, and Superior Consolidated Industries employees.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.14mg/l) is 3.6 miles.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios / TOXIC:\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Acrylonitrile involves the release of 1,000 pounds of acrylonitrile from the Adduct Reactor / Blow Tank due to a failure in the control logic for the valve in the acrylonitrile addition line.  The Toxic end point (0.076 mg/l) is 0.2 mile.  The release duration "

      "SummaryText": "is 30 minutes.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia is 88.1 pounds per minute leaking from a broken pipe on the ammonia transfer pump.  The line leaks for 30 minutes until the Emergency Response Team arrives and establishes a water spray onto the pump.  The toxic end point (0.14 mg/l) is 0.2 mile.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Formaldehyde is a 3/8-inch line leaking at the transfer pump at the formaldehyde storage tank.  The material leaks into a diked area for 30 minutes until the Emergency Response Team arrives, suits up, and stops the leak.  The toxic end point (0.012 mg/l) is 0.1 mile.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Methyl Chloride is due to an automatic valve opening due to a computer malfunction causing the release of 1,200 pounds of Methyl Chloride over a 30 minute period. The material leaks into a tank vent discharging onto the building roof.  The toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) is 0.1 mile.\n\nWorst Case Scenario / FLAMMABLE:\nThe first Worst Case Scenario for Flammable involves Ethylene.  The Ethylene storage tank ruptures allowing the release of 49,000 pounds of ethylene over a 10 minute time period.  The 1-PSI Blast radius is 1,571 feet or 0.3 Mile.\n\nWorst Case Scenario / FLAMMABLE:\nThe second Worst Case Scenario for Flammable involves Ethyl Chloride.  The Ethyl Chloride storage tank ruptures allowing the release of 135,000 pounds of Ethyl Chloride over a 10 minute time period.  The 1-PSI Blast radius is 1,571 feet or 0.3 Mile.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios / FLAMMABLE:\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Ethylene involves the release of 88 pounds of Ethylene for 30 minutes from a broken section of 3/8-inch stainless tubing.  The 1-PSI distance is 528 feet or 0.1 Mile.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Ethyl Chloride involves release of 88 pounds of Ethyl Chloride for 30 minutes from a broken section of 3/8-inch stainless tubing.  The 1-PSI distance is 528 feet or 0.1 Mile.\n\nBoth of these flammable gases are piped to an in plant flar"

We also participate in CMA's Responsible Care program.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n7 Process Safety Information\n7 Process Hazard Analysis\n7 Training\n7 Mechanical Integrity\n7 Management of Change\n7 Pre-Startup Reviews\n7 Compliance Audits\n7 Incident Investigations\n7 Employee Participation\n7 Hot Work Permits\n7 Contractor Safety\n\nWitco Corporation has \"Layers of Protection\" to help ensure that an emergency situation with off-site implications will not arise and have put several layers of safety and environmental protection into place.  This includes the following elements:\n7 Employees are well trained and are our most important resource in operating our facility and in protecting our community.\n7 Mechanical Integrity testing for major pieces of process equipment like metal fatigue and thickness testing.\n7 Comprehensive Technical Hazard Reviews conducted at least every 5 years on processes using these RMP regulated chemicals and on design changes for production units before the changes are made.  An excellent record keeping software program allows similar situations to be compared.\n7 Distributed Control Systems are used throughout the plant.  They are interconnected which allows control to be shifted to another control station in the event of a computer system failure until full capability is restored.\n7 We have highly sensitive monitoring instrumentation available that will detect very low concentrations of these materials.\n7 The key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the location qui"

All well trained and experienced with our materials.\n7 We have in-plant notification systems that can be used to summon our in-plant emergency responders.  Working through the Peoria County LEPC and the County Sheriff's Department, we are able to summon necessary responders from the Timber-Hollis Volunteer Fire Department and the Pekin Area Fire Departments.  The Emergency Notification system can also be used to notify local residents of the need to \"Shelter-in-Place\" when conditions warrant it.\n7 We have an extensive Community Emergency Exercise history involving the above mentioned agencies.  We have another exercise planned for this coming fall.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nWe keep accurate records for all accidental releases involving all chemicals from our facility.  Witco Corporation Mapleton Plant believes there have been NO accidents or incidents according to the RMP Rule definition for releases or incidents involving covered chemicals during the past five years that has resulted in injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan addresses all reasonable contingency cases."
