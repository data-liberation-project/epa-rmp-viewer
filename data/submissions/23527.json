The facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  The management at Deans is planning to continue with this program as follows:\n\n1.  Continued maintenance program for ammonia refrigeration equipment to ensure ongoing integrity of the equipment.\n\n2.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the On-Site Emergency Response Plan.\n\n3.   Continue to have employee involvement in safety development.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nDean's Services maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Dean's Services facility is located at 1600 Donner Avenue in San Francisco, CA.  This facility provides refrigeration for food products.  The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 7 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side.  \n\n\u00bf Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\u00bf The total ammonia inventory is 18,000 pounds. \n\nHA"

      "SummaryText": "ZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary:\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel.  The High Pressure Receiver (located in the Engine Room) is the largest vessel in the system (with a capacity greater than 18,000 pounds of ammonia) and is assumed to contain the total charge of the system for the worst case scenario.  Since the Receiver is enclosed by the facility, passive mitigation effects were taken into consideration when determining the release rate of ammonia to the outside atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 7560 pounds.  This release could occur due to a gasket rupture, pinhole leak, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc. In addition, this release could occur outside; therefore passive mitigation measures were not utilized. The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability. This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No"

The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  There are three Operations Level trained employees at the facility. These employees have completed the OSHA 8 Hour Operation Level Training program and participate in 8 hour annual refresher training classes. \n\nThe Respo"
