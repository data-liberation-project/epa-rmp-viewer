KFDC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKFDC produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.     \r\n\r\nThe ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at KFDC in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  As the flammable mixture moves through the plant production process, it comes to contain ammonia as well.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n  \r\nThe ac"

      "SummaryText": "cidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KFDC.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\n-\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nKFDC is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of a release of ammonia by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\r\n-\tReducing the severity of fires and providing a means to control vapor cloud formation with fire monitors located throughout the facility.\r\n-\tReducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms on storage tanks and bullets.\r\n-\tRequiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconnected.\r\n-\tProviding an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia due to overpressurization.\r\n-\tRequiring p"

The incident occurred in October 2013 and resulted in an injury that required medical treatment.  There have been no other releases of RMP-regulated substances that have resulted in onsite injuries, deaths, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \r\n \r\n \r\n Emergency Response Program\r\n \r\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate emergency response actions necessary for KFDC with the Ford County Fire Department and Sheriff.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be, the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Western Plains Medical Complex and Victory Electric.  The KFDC Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n \r\n \r\n Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n \r\n Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely eva"
