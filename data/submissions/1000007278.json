It is the responsibility of each employee to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with this policy.\n\nAkzo Nobel Battleground Site manufacturers metal alkyl compounds which are primarily used as catalyst or co-catalyst for polymer manufacturing.  None of the toxic or flammable chemical Worst Case or Alternate Release Scenarios are expected to impact local residencies, schools, hospitals or environmentally sensitive areas.  \n\nThe plant has had an active program to prevent potential incidents, respond quickly to emergencies and reduce impacts of any materials it handles in the plant.  Examples of activities under the program include trained personnel operating and maintaining our processes, cooperative industry response alliances (Channel Industries Mutual Aid or CIMA) and close interaction with Community response agencies (LEPC, Fire Departments).  The storage of chemicals on site is minimized and chemicals are kept on site on an as needed basis.  \n\nFail safe systems are installed to protect our personnel as well as the public from effects of release or impacts of on site chemicals.  Personnel are trained to quickly respond to mitigate damage to personnel, public and property.  A community notification system is in place and personnel are trained to inform the public of any incident or event that has an impact or possible effect with an emphasis on public protection.\n\nThere has been one release of RMP flammable chemicals and no releases of toxic chemicals in the five-year accident history of the plant.  This submittal is an update of the accident history and appropriate portions of Section 7 to reflect a release that occurred at the site.\n\nAs a mitigation measure, the site maintains an Emergency Action Plan which has been developed based on best management practices, regulatory requirements, voluntary compliance programs (OSHA VPP, ISO 14001 and RC-14001), corporate guidance and industry sharing of experience.
