              "Description": "The chlorine unit has a  chemical metering pump with positive-displacement, diaphragm type pump.  The pump is equipped with a flowmeter-pulser assembly, that automatically stops pulsating when discharge pressure exceeds pump pressure, and when the power source is gone.  The pump also, has a four-function valve assembly with positive anti-siphon feature and a back-pressure function making chemical discharges without over-pumping due to discharge velocity.  There is also a priming-line pressure release, and a pressure relief function, to relieve against back-pressure.  Any back-pressure is released back into the chemical solution tank via polyethylene tubing.  The solution tank has an overflow drain that is directed to flow in the city sewer lines.  In  summary, the chlorine unit has a foot valve assembly that consists of a ball check valve and strainer, allowing the chlorine solution to flow in one direction only and preventing it from dropping back into the tank.  Followed by another ball check valve before entering the pump head.  The pump head is a positive-displacement diaphragm pump, allowing only a metered amount of solution through a combination anti-siphon/pressure relief valve into the discharge tubing into in injection valve, also containing a ball check valve that is spring loaded.  Any accidental spills of the chlorine solution are covered with a clay absorbent and disposed of properly.  NOTE:  The chlorine solution utilized is diluted by 50%, so as to feed a 6% solution with a 30% stroke frequency.",

      "SummaryText": "The community of Fort Kipp is located within the southeast corner of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation along U.S. Highway No. 2.  Approximately nine (9) miles west of Culbertson and twenty-two (22) miles east of Poplar within Roosevelt County, in the State of Montana.  Fort Kipp has 38 service connections, a church, two (2) community centers, Head Start center, laundromat, playground, Tribal ceremonial/pow-wow grounds, uses approximately 15,000 gallons of water per day.  The water is pumped from one well source within the community.  Fort Kipp is sustained by farming, ranching and basic services.  The original water system was designed and constructed in the early 70's and consisted of a well, pump house, controls, water distribution system (4\" watermains) and a storage facility.  The storage facility consists of a 40,000 gallon underground tank.  The pump house has a chlorinator system that was installed 1992, upon bacteriological contamination.  The chlorinator system consists of a 50-gallon solution tank, a positive-displacement pump with back-pressure relief/anti-siphon valve.  The chlorine unit, is a metering pump that can be regulated between internal and external pulsing by means of a switch with frequency control knob.  The pump drive is totally encapsulated in a chemical resistant housing to provide for maximum protection against chemical spillage.  Chemical metering pump valves are ball check valves seated on combination valve seat and seal ring, that are routinely checked an replaced as they get worn.  The four function valve provides protection against chemical overloading and spillage, with negative pressure at discharge closing the  diaphragm an preventing siphoning.  The pressure relief function de-pressurizes the discharge line preventing chemical overpumping and possible line ruptures."
