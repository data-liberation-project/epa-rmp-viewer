Refrigerated and frozen inventory \ncooling at both Distribution Centers is provided by two separate anhydrous ammonia \nrefrigeration systems located within each Distribution Center.  The storage and use of the \nanhydrous ammonia is the only substance used by GFS that is subject to the Risk \nManagement Plan (RMP) requirements.  The ammonia refrigeration systems at the \ndistribution facilities contain the following:  \n- 50th Street Distribution Center:  10,080 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, and\n- Clay Avenue Distribution Center:  23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nBoth refrigeration systems consist of the following basic elements:\n- compressors,\n- high pressure receiver,\n- liquid chiller,\n- heat exchanger,\n- condensers, and \n- associated piping and valves.\n\nRefer to the attached process flow diagram for further design of the refrigeration systems \nat both Distribution Centers.

The only exterior components of the \nrefrigeration system are the condensers and associated piping and valves.  The \ncompressor room has only two access points. One access point is a door that opens into \nthe warehouse itself and the second access point is a door that leads directly to the \noutside of the facility that remains continuously locked from the inside.  The limited \naccess to the compressor room essentially contains the refrigeration system \nand acts as containment in the event of a release.  \n\nThe chillers are suspended from the ceiling of the warehouse throughout the refrigerated \nand frozen food product areas.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as \"the \nrelease of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line \nfailure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\"  Basically, a worst-\ncase release is a catastrophic event that destroys the process and/or storage vessels and \nimmediately releases all stored materials.  \n\nIn order to determine the impact of a worst case accidental release of ammonia to off-site \nreceptors (public), an off-site consequence analysis was conducted.  RMP*Comp, \ndeveloped by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), was the model utilized to determine the \npotential area of impact a worst case accidental release of ammonia could cause.  GFS \nmodeled both Distribution Centers to assess which refrigeration system created the \ngreatest area of impact.

The scenario \ndeveloped for the 50th Street Distribution Center (a rupture in the High Pressure Receiver \nlocated on the rooftop of the warehouse building) generated the largest area of impact and \nwas therefore utilized for the Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The following site-specific \nparameters and required default parameters were utilized to conduct the off-site \nconsequence analysis for the 50th Street Distribution Center: \n- Quantity of ammonia liquefied under pressure: 10,080 pounds (present in the high-\npressure receiver located on the rooftop of the 50th Street Distribution Center (site-\nspecific value)\n- Height of Release:  ground level (default value)\n- Release Duration:  10 minutes (default value)\n- Mitigation Measures:  None (default value)\n- Topography:  Urban Surroundings (site-specific value)\n- Wind Speed:  1.5 meters/second (default value)\n- Stability Class:  F (default value)\n- Air Temperature:  77 degrees Fahrenheit (default value)\n\nThese site specific values and default values were input into the RMP*Comp model to \ncalculate the Toxic Endpoint and Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  The \ncalculated results are 0.14 mg/L and 1.2 miles, respectively.  \n\nIn order for a release of this magnitude to occur, all automated and engineered fail-safe \nmechanisms would have to have been destroyed also.  Basically, a catastrophic event like \na tornado or earthquake would have to destroy the High Pressure Receiver \ninstantaneously to meet the assumptions required by a worst case scenario.  With respect \nto GFS, the immediate release would be in liquid form ultimately evaporating to the \natmosphere over time.\n\nThis model also assumes that the release occurs at ground level which is not an accurate \nrepresentation of the site.

This would significantly reduce the \nammonia concentration (0.14 mg/l as calculated by RMP*COMP) of the vapor cloud and \nradius of impact (only affecting the public located immediately downwind of the release). \n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nGFS has reviewed their ammonia refrigeration system to determine a more likely release \nscenario.  The Process Hazard Analysis conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process \nSafety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 indicated that a release caused by a hole \nin piping caused by corrosion or a leaking valve along the piping run located on the roof \nof the warehouse is a more plausible release scenario.  Under normal operating \nconditions, the rooftop piping and associated valves are operating under 175 psig.  The \nalternate release scenario was calculated assuming a valve was damaged creating a 2 inch \nhole (diameter of the valve).  The release rate was calculated utilizing the Bernoulli \nEquation:\nQR = HA x (203)(Pg)1/2\nWhere:    QR = Release rate (pounds/minute)\n    HA = Hole area (square inches)\n    Pg = Gauge pressure (psig)\n\nUsing this equation, the release rate was calculated to be 4,792 pounds of anhydrous \nammonia per minute.  Inputting the calculated release rate of 4,792 pounds/minute and \nthe default release duration of 60 minutes into the RMP*Comp model, an estimated \ndistance to the Toxic Endpoint was calculated to be 0.5 miles.  This radius of impact is \nsignificantly smaller than the worst case scenario, however; it could still impact the \nsurrounding public.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario model assumes that all of the engineered fail safe measures \npresent in the ammonia refrigeration system at GFS fail.  The fail safe measures that \nwould have to fail include automatic and manual alarms and shutoff mechanisms \nincluding manual shut down of the system follow"

The Wyoming Fire Department and Police Department conducted emergency \nnotification of all persons within two blocks of the release.    \n\nThe source of the leak was determined to be from external corrosion of the pipe.  \nSubsequently, GFS has instituted an aggressive and predictive preventative maintenance \nprogram which includes inspection, repair and replacement of piping.  Additionally, GFS \nhas made a significant commitment to responding to and preventing releases to the \nenvironment in the future by being actively involved with the Kent County LEPC and \ndeveloping, training, and equipping a HAZMAT team and a mobile command center for \nthe Grand Rapids Distribution Centers.\n \nEmergency Response Program\n\nGFS has developed an extensive Emergency Response Program to respond to a chemical \nrelease from the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the 50th Street and Clay \nAvenue Distribution Centers.  GFS has developed in conjunction with the Kent County \nLEPC an Emergency Response Plan for GFS's Grand Rapids Campus.  The Emergency \nResponse Plan details:\n- pre-emergency planning procedures, \n- GFS's Emergency Response Team organizational structure, \n- training requirements, \n- emergency recognition and prevention procedures, \n- emergency alerting procedures, \n- evacuation procedures, \n- emergency medical services, \n- emergency response procedures, \n- medical surveillance procedures, and\n- post emergency response critique procedures. \n\nEmergency response personnel are available to respond to a release 24 hours per day \nseven days per week.  GFS has provided not only employee training but all necessary \nresources needed to adequately, quickly, and safely respond to and mitigate a release of \nanhydrous ammonia.  An Emergency Response Trailer has been created and equipped \nwith personal protective equipment, first aid equipment, and two-way radios"

      "SummaryText": "ements in employee training, \noperations and procedures that involve the refrigeration systems at both Distribution \nCenters.  These changes have increased the safety for all on-site employees and \nsignificantly reduced the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia from not only occurring \nbut also from migrating off-site and impacting the surrounding residences and businesses.  \nGFS is committed to continually improve the operations of the refrigeration system to \ncontinue to reduce the threat of a release occurring from these two systems.  The changes \nproposed for the immediate future include but are not limited to:\n- Developing a Hot Work Program for refrigeration contractors,\n- Further enhancing the Compliance Audits Program by developing an Internal \nAuditing Program and peer review from personnel at other Distribution Centers,\n- Continually enhancing the Employee Training Program to allow GFS to obtain the \nbest available information and technology for improving refrigeration system \nefficiency and safety,\n- Developing procedures for selecting and assessing contractors to ensure, at minimum, \nthey meet OSHA's safety requirements, and\n- Expanding the management system developed to address anhydrous ammonia as \nrequired by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the RMP to include \nall chemicals that pose a risk by developing an Integrated Contingency Plan.\n\n\nGFS is considering adopting the principles and management characteristics of an ISO \n14000 Environmental Management System to manage environmental, health and safety \ncompliance issues consistently throughout GFS's diversified organization.  An \nEnvironmental Management System is a proactive voluntary initiative that a company \ncommits itself to going beyond compliance.  This system will allow Gordon Food Service \nto seek additional improvements in their effort to manage, control and potentially \neliminate the risks associated with GFS's daily operational tasks.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
