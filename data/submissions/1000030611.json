      "SummaryText": "CONTRA COSTA POWER PLANT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\n1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.1 BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nGenOn (GenOn) owns and operates Contra Costa Generating Station (CCGS), an electric power generating facility located east of Antioch, California, in Contra Costa County.  There are seven existing units at CCGS: Units 1 through 5, which have been retired, and Units 6 and 7, which continue to operate for electric power generation.  In 2001, GenOn began construction of a new combined cycle power generation unit (Unit 8) at the CCGS site.  In 2002, GenOn suspended construction activities associated with Unit 8.  In 2006, ownership of the Unit 8 asset was transferred from GenOn to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and has been renamed the Gateway Generating Station by PG&E.\r\n\r\nGenOn operates the existing Unit 7 at CCGS with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as required to comply with Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 11, \"Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Electric Power Generating Steam Boilers.\"  GenOn began operation of the SCR system for Unit 7 in November of 2001.\r\n\r\nThe SCR technology utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from the generating unit.  The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 29.4 percent by weight.  This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both California and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was established in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The California Office of Emergency Services established the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The CalARP Program specifies the regulated substances and determines the requirements f"

In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD), to whom this RMP has been submitted.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the SCR system for Unit 7, the quantity of aqueous ammonia that is stored and used at CCGS is greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities; therefore, an RMP is required.  As shown in this RMP, a worst-case release scenario from the CCGS aqueous ammonia system would cause the toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia (200 parts per million by volume [ppmv]) to extend into the area of the Gateway Generating Station facility, which is owned and operated by PG&E and qualifies as an offsite receptor.  Therefore, the process cannot be classified as Program 1.  Although, aqueous ammonia is listed as a regulated substance in Section 2770.5 of CalARP regulations, the power generation industry is not specifically required to submit extensive Program 3 RMP requirements, and the CCCHSD has determined that the risk posed by this process does not justify classifying the process as Program 3.  Accordingly, this process qualifies as a Program 2 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill the Program 2 RMP requirements, the following actions were completed: \r\n\r\n    - Analyze a worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) and perform an offsite consequence analysis;\r\n    - Describe the site's accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps;\r\n    - Ensure that emergency response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies;\r\n    - Describe the site's safety program;\r\n    - Describe the site's hazard review program;\r\n    - Describe the site's operating procedures;\r\n    - Describe the site's training programs;\r\n    - Describe the site's maintenance progr"

This location was selected largely on the basis of safety considerations, because it maximizes the distance from residences, reducing any potential offsite impacts in the event of an accidental release, while minimizing the piping distance to the unit.  In addition, the location was chosen because of the storage facility area's low occupancy, easy access for delivery trucks, adequate distance from combustion equipment, and minimum potential impacts to plant personnel.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage facility consists of a truck unloading station and three aqueous ammonia storage tanks.  The three storage tanks are made of carbon steel, with capacities of 21,200 gallons each, and dimensions of approximately 10 feet in diameter by 38 feet long.  The storage facility has been designed and constructed to receive and store aqueous ammonia for three different SCR systems: the Unit 7 SCR system that is currently in operation, a planned SCR system for Unit 6 that has not been installed and an SCR system for PG&E's Gateway Generating Station.  At the present time, the aqueous ammonia storage tanks for both the Unit 7 SCR system and for PG&E's Gateway Generating Station are in service.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank that was installed for the Unit 6 SCR system is currently empty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Unit 7 storage tank has a capacity of 21,200 gallons, the effective maximum volume of the storage tank is limited to 20,000 gallons through administrative controls, which"

The tanks have been designed and constructed in compliance with Uniform Building Code Seismic Zone 4, Uniform Fire Code Article 80, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 1, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels.  The tanks have a maximum design pressure and temperature of 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F), respectively.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tanks are supported horizontally on concrete foundations within a walled containment basin approximately 68 feet long by 44 feet wide that slopes to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks and running the length of the containment area.  This sump is 6 feet wide and 12 feet deep and provides a volume sufficient to hold 100 percent of the contents of one aqueous ammonia storage tank, plus the maximum rainfall recorded in 24 hours in the past 53 years (3.03 inches, WRCC 1955-2008).

The portion of the piping between the storage tank containment area and the Unit 7 SCR injection grid that crosses the roadway and parking areas is contained within a covered trench that protects the piping from vehicular traffic and provides secondary containment.  The section of piping between the storage tank containment area and the covered trench and the section of piping that exits the covered trench and delivers aqueous ammonia to the SCR injection grid is contained within larger-diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping for all stretches as per the request of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District (CCCFPD).  Therefore, secondary containment is provided for all sections of aqueous ammonia piping.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia delivery and injection facilities for the Unit 7 SCR system include two aqueous ammonia feed pumps, ammonia vaporization equipment, and an ammonia injection grid.  In the SCR system, aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to spray nozzles inside the ammonia vaporizer unit that is mounted on the vaporizer skid near the SCR reactor.  The spray droplets are then mixed with a hot air diluent stream in the vaporizer to evaporate the ammonia and water.  The vaporizer produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia in the diluent stream.  The diluent stream is then transported to the injection grid.\r\n\r\n1.3.1.3\tAmmonia Injection Grid / SCR\r\nThe ammonia injection grid provides additional mixing of the diluent stream and transports it to the SCR reactor.  The SCR reactor converts much of the ammonia and oxides of nitrogen from the flue gas into nitrogen gas and water, which are released from the stack.\r\n\r\nThe injection grid is located upstream of the SCR reactor.  This allows more thorough mixing of the ammonia-laden diluent stream with the turbulent flue gas from the boiler.  Although the oxidation-reduction reacti"

The treated flue gas, containing a small amount of unreacted NOx and ammonia, is then discharged out of the stack.\r\n\r\nThe SCR process is controlled with feed-forward and feedback control loops.  An upstream NOx analyzer measures the NOx concentration prior to the SCR reactor inlet.  A downstream analyzer measures the NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet.  The ammonia demand signal, which regulates the rate at which aqueous ammonia is pumped to the vaporizer, is determined from both NOx analyzers.\r\n \r\n1.3.2\tAqueous Ammonia Hazards\r\nThe aqueous ammonia solution that is used for the Unit 7 SCR system at CCGS is 29.4 percent ammonia by weight, with water making up the balance of the solution.  Aqueous ammonia is a corrosive material, although the degree of danger associated with the substance is considered to be minor.  Ammonia is not a known carcinogen, but it poses acute and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards to the respiratory system and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards as skin irritations or other effects.  Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution; the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound that is also used for SCR systems.  Ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few ppmv and acutely toxic in high concentrations.  A 1-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals. \r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ig"

To support GenOn's strict goal of accident-free operation, a management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the various RMP program elements.  In this management system, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP program elements.  An organizational chart showing the titles of those positions assigned responsibility for implementing the individual RMP program elements and defining the lines of authority has been developed.  Each position having responsibility for the different RMP program elements reports changes that affect the RMP to the Plant Manager, who ensures that all affected elements of the RMP are updated appropriately and that the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) is kept abreast of all changes to the RMP.  Changes to RMP program elements are communicated to all other positions having responsibility for RMP program elements during regularly scheduled meetings, including daily tailboard meetings and weekly staff meetings.  RMP program element changes that include revisions to procedures, plans or policies, training, hazard reviews, and changes to drawings or other documents are also communicated during staff meetings or through project coordination and design review meetings.  The individual RMP program elements, such as training, emergency response, etc., are outlined in this RMP. \r\n\r\nTo ensure continued compliance with the CalARP regulations, GenOn will update this RMP within 5 years of the most recent update, before any additional regulated substance is brought onsite, before additional aqueous ammonia storage is installed"

The location of the aqueous ammonia storage facility was selected to be in a low occupancy area of the plant and at a maximum distance from the property fenceline to reduce potential onsite and offsite impacts from a spill.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tanks are enclosed within a walled containment basin that slopes to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks, which runs the length of the containment area.  There also is a walled containment pad at the tanker truck unloading facility that drains rapidly into the covered sump under the tanks in the event of a spill.\r\n\r\nMany accident prevention safeguards have been implemented within the aqueous ammonia storage area.  For example, in the event of a power outage, standby power needed for all required electrical systems, such as monitors and alarms, is provided by the Uninterruptible Power Supply system.  Also, hot work permits are required for specific activities that present the potential for fire, and personnel involved in such operations have received appropriate training. \r\n\r\nOther safety features of the aqueous ammonia storage facility include:\r\n \r\n    - Ammonia area monitoring system with audible and visible alarms;\r\n    - Eyewash and shower stations;\r\n    - Piping and connections"

The aqueous ammonia is used in the liquid state as a reagent for the Unit 7 SRC system.  There are a total of three 21,200-gallon carbon steel aqueous ammonia storage tanks.  One of the three storage tanks, including the associated pumps, pipes and control systems, has been transferred to PG&E's ownership and serves the Gateway Generating Station.  GenOn utilizes one of the ammonia storage tanks for the Unit 7 SCR system.  The other GenOn storage tank is not currently used and remains empty.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia is heated and vaporized prior to injection into the boiler exhaust stream, where it reacts with a catalyst to reduce NOx emissions.  The potential health risks associated with aqueous ammonia are discussed in Section 1.3.2.\r\n\r\nGenOn has developed an extensive safety program to reduce the risks associated with the handling of hazardous materials such as aqueous ammonia.  The purpose of the safety program is to protect GenOn employees, neighbors, and the Antioch community from health risks associated with the operation of the CCGS.  The development, distribution, and implementation of the SCR process safety information are critical to proper and safe operation of the system.

Incident investigations are conducted whenever a catastrophic release of a hazardous substance occurs that requires an agency notification or results in injuries or illnesses that require medical attention.  Incident investigations are also conducted for near misses that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a hazardous material or a potential injury or illness.  The primary purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying root causes of the incident, and to develop and implement corrective actions to prevent the incident or similar incidents from recurring.  Incident reports are distributed to all GenOn facilities to reduce repeat occurrences and share lessons learned.  The incident investigation program at the CCGS is beneficial to release prevention by ensuring that any incident or potential incident will not be repeated, thus reducing the chance of future incidents.\r\n\r\nAll incidents requiring an investigation, including near-miss incidents are reported immediately to the appropriate department supervisor.
