This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators? problem solving abilities up-to-date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.\n\nDescription of Plant\n\nSherman Gas Plant is an unmanned natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction facility, with local sales of NGL from a pressurized storage tank. The facility consists of an NGL extraction plant, sales of natural gas to a pipeline system and sales of NGL locally. There are no toxic substances at the plant in quantities above the regulated threshold quantity. The facility is classified as a Program Level 2 under the RMP regulations since the facility is not subject to PSM regulations (due to being unmanned). The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about the operations at the facility, the programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, the emergency response plan, the five year accident history at the facility and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Sherman Gas Plant complies with EPA?s accidental release prevention rule and applicable state and local codes. The facility maintains safety information on the facility at the facility and at the company offices. The facility was constructed according to good engineering practices. A hazard review will be performed in the near future. A previous hazard review was performed during construction/startup of the facility. The hazard review shall meet the requirements for Program Level 2 facilities. There are  operating procedures for the equipment at the facility. Employees at the facility are trained prior to starting work at the facility to ensure that they are able to safely operate the facility and safely react "
