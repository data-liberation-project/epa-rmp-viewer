      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe ADM Decatur Corn Processing Plant has developed two Risk Management Programs (RMPs) to cover:\n\n1) The  processes utilizing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant (carbon dioxide liquefaction and alcohol cooling water chillers).\n\n2)  The storage of ?Natural Gasoline? which is used to denature ethyl alcohol  prior to being stored for loadout.  The following elements are addressed in the programs:\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPreventing the release of toxic and flammable chemicals is of paramount importance at the Corn Plant due to the serious acute health or catastrophic effects that may result from exposure to toxic fumes or an explosion.  Management has made it clear that all leaks are to be taken seriously and that operation of the systems is expected to be performed in a careful and professional manner.  Emergency response policy is predicated on the serious nature of any toxic or flammable chemical leak, and stresses the importance of calling in properly trained and equipped professionals when a leak is beyond the capabilities on on-site employees.\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Corn Plant is owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company and is located at 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois, 62526.  The facility utilizes the wet corn milling process to produce two primary products:  high fructose corn syrup and fuel-grade ethanol. Biological fermentation and thermal distillation are utilized to produce ethyl alcohol from a corn starch slurry.  The 200 proof ethyl alcohol is made non-potable by the addition of 5% natural gasoline. A byproduct of the ethanol production process is large quantities of CO2.  After collecting the CO2, the Corn Plant uses anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to liquefy it and store it for sale to end customers.  The ethanol production process also requires chilled water for certain reactions.  This chilled water is created by using separate anhydrous ammonia"

      "SummaryText": " refrigeration systems which are located in a completely separate area of the plant.\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\nEPA has requested that Offsite Consequence Analysis information not be provided in the executive summary due to security concerns.\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for ammonia-specific prevention steps are detailed in the Corn Plant?s Chemical Management Program for the ammonia refrigeration areas.  The accidental release prevention program for the natural gasoline-specific steps are detailed in the Corn Plant?s Process Safety Management Plan for the Ethanol Storage Area.\n\nBoth plans are maintained by the Safety Department and cover areas such as standard operating procedures, employee training, etc.\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years from the date of this plan, the Corn Plant has had no covered releases."
