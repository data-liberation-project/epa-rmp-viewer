The facility is a chemical distribution plant which stores, sells and repackages industrial gases.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, security cameras, and yard lights.\n\n\n\nBased on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substance is stored by the facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity:\n\n\n\nAcetylene gas (CAS #74-86-2)\n\n\n\nIn the last five years there have been no major accidents associated with flammable gases.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response procedures for the stationary source includes emergency stop technology, safe operating procedures, a well trained workforce, along with an emergency response plan and a well established relationship with the jurisdictional fire department.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no specific planned changes intended to improve the safety of the flammable gases handled at the facility, although management encourages continuous operator input through regular safety meetings and on-going training.  Should an opportunity to improve safety become available, the facility will thoroughly review the feasibility of such a change."
