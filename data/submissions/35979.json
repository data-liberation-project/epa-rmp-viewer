Milton Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the Milton Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Milton Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Milton Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the Milton Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Tomah's Milton Plant.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is two-fold. First of all, it evaluates the consequences of incidents that could occur or the quantity of a release required to have an off-site impact.  Secondly, it has a systematic prevention program which is designed to prevent these potential incidents from occurring. \n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTomah's Milton Plant is committed to the safety of the plant's workers and of the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Tomah, Milton Plant implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to minimize such releases. Tomah's Milton Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and coordinates with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  In the unlikely eve"

It is one of the basic building blocks which is incorporated into nearly all of our finished products.\n\u00b7 Ethylene Oxide (EO) and Propylene Oxide (PO) are used to produce specialty products called alkoxylated amines or tertiary amines.  These alkoxylated amines are used in industrial, institutional and agricultural products.\n\u00b7 Methyl chloride is used to prepare other specialty surfactants.  Methyl chloride quaternizes the alkoxylated products (it makes the products carry a positive charge).  These materials are used as emulsifiers and cleaning agents.\n\u00b7 Ammonia is used in the production of amines to minimize side reactions.   It is subsequently recovered in the ammonia recovery system, which forms ammonia water and ammonium phosphate. \n\u00b7 Ammonia water is formed when we recover the ammonia used in the process.\n\u00b7 Hydrogen is used to hydrogenate nitriles to amines that are used in iron mining, fuel additives and further reacted to other surfactants.\n\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at Tomah's Milton Plant, the following processes are covered by the RMP rule:\n\nProcess\t\nProgram Level\t\nRegulated Substances\tProcess Inventory, lbs.\nAcrylonitrile storage/processing\t3\tAcrylonitrile\t190000\nEthylene oxide storage/processing\t3\tEthylene oxide\t190000\nPropylene oxide storage/processing\t3\tPropylene oxide\t45,000\nMethyl chloride storage/processing\t3\tMethyl chloride\t230,000\nHydrogen storage/processing\t3\tHydrogen\t10,500\nAmmonia storage/processing\t3\tAmmonia\t10,000\nAmmonia water formation\t3\tAmmonia water > 20%\t80000\n\n\n\n\n1.3  Offsite Cons"

      "SummaryText": "equence Analysis\n\nTomah's  Milton Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS).  The  Milton Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. ARS represent a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Milton Plant.  ARS help Tomah and the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\no\tWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n\u00a7 When considering flammable substances, an over-pressurization of 1 psi is the endpoint.  This pressure may cause partial demolition of houses and shattered glass, and may cause injury to people.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is a catastrophic failure of the regulated substances storage tank.  The released material evaporates, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is based on using the EPA look-up tables. This scenario assumes all controls, including the acrylonitrile secondary containment tank fail.\n\nThe worst case scenario for release of a flammable substance means the total"

Additionallly, we performed  a search for all reportable releases of these chemicals over the past 5 years to evaluate the likelihood and quantities of chemicals likely to be released to the environment.  The EPA RMP regulation requires one ARS to be evaluated for each process.  Tomah Products has gone beyond this requirement to evaluate potential off-site impacts from many aspects associated with the use of these chemicals. \n\nThe releases presented here have been evaluated for planning purposes.  The RMP regulation specifically requires facilities to analyze scenarios that have off-site impact.   The purpose of this requirement is to evaluate in advance the degree of impact certain release quantities would have on the community and what type of response-either shelter in place or evacuate is required to protect the community.  In addition, for some processes where more reasonable scenarios do not have an off-site impact, we have used scenario development to determine what magnitude of release is required to have an off-site impact. These releases, though they probably never will occur, help us to improve our systems in the event we need to respond to an emergency.\n\n\nFor many of the scenarios presented here, an air dispersion model called Aloha was used.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Milton Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary or that these measure would improve operability.  All action items in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Milton Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.   Action items are tracked until they are complete.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Tomah  Milton Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

New employees receive \"front-end\" training in the  Milton Plant operations.  This training heavily emphasizes the safety, health and environmental systems and procedures that pertain to the site and the employee's job.  After successfully completing this training, a new technician is paired with a senior technician to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  Additionally, a comprehensive, independent-study program is required.  This training program includes more specific details on safety and job-related tasks.  After technicians demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.   Finally, monthly training sessions are provided which cover all regulatory training and other general subjects.  All of this training is documented for each technician, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\nThe Tomah  Milton Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Milton Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Contractors are trained at least annually and must pass a test to work at the Milton site.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Tomah  Milton Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.  If the deficiency cannot be corrected the equipment will be replaced or removed from service.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Milton Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.
