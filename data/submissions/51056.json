ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston is committed to providing its employees and the surrounding community with a safe and healthy environment.  The Risk Management Program is an integral part of our strong commitment to A?sustainable development,A? which means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  Sustainable Development requires reductions in the generation of wastes and pollutants, protection of clean air and clean water, sustainable protection of the land, and the wise use of energy.  It requires employee commitment, strategic thinking, innovation, the involvement of our suppliers, new technology and enhanced production processes.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Morrow Cold Storage facility in Boardman, Oregon, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston, Inc.  Morrow Cold Storage stores and processes various frozen foods and vegetables such as potatoes, peas, carrots, beans, and corn.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.  The plant site consists of a packaging plant, refrigerated cold storage, and office trailers.  Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nConAgra Foods Lamb WestonA?s accident prevention/loss control systems and policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and best-management practices.  The OSHA-PSM and the EPA-RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled to the best of our ability, and that the processes are meeting health and safety objectives.\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the "

Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our inventory.  The process hazard analysis was performed by a team which included representatives from our skilled work force who understood the process being analyzed, including the engineering behind the covered process.  This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia.   \n\nIn order to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia, a system of checks and balances has been established.  This system will evaluate safety prior to the work being done, and provide a solid review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed.  Standard operating procedures are in place for each operating phase and are readily accessible to those workers who operate or maintain the process.  In addition, a policy and procedure are used to assure that proper safety precautions are taken for all personnel performing Hot Work.  The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained according to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and according to a well-documented preventive maintenance program.\n\nAn extensive training program is in place for those employees and contractors involved in working on or around the process and covers operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.

Part of this training includes monthly safety meetings as well as drills on spill response and plant evacuation.  \n\nAny incidents related to the ammonia refrigeration systems are promptly investigated even though the rule only requires investigation of those incidents, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release.  All incidents are analyzed, resolved, and findings shared with affected employees.  In order to assure compliance with all elements of the prevention program, an audit is conducted every three years including a report of the findings and documentation of any deficiencies corrected.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Morrow Cold Storage facility in the last five years from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Morrow Cold Storage facility has an emergency action plan which has been coordinated (reviewed) with the Boardman Fire Department.  Both are members of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee.    \n\nThe plan applies to all Morrow Cold Storage (ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston) employees, visitors, and support service contractors performing tasks and activities as part of ongoing operations.  The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.  \n\nTraining of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Morrow Cold Storage and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan"
