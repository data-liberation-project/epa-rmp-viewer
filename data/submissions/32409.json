This information was used by FCWTF staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine processes.\n\nThe chlorine PHAs were conducted by an interdisciplinary team of FCWTF staff familiar with the process operation and maintenance and facility management along with FCWTF consultant CH2M HILL. The PHA was performed using a combination of \u00bfWhat If\u00bf and \u00bfChecklist\u00bf methods. Based on the results of the PHAs, some changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the FCWTF were identified. These changes have all been addressed and are being implemented.\n\n3. OPERATING PROCEDURES: Operating procedures for the chlorination process were developed prior to the RMP. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\n\nThe detailed operating procedures include start-up, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures. The procedures describe how the system should be operated to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. TRAINING: An effective RMP training program can significantly reduce the number and severity of accidental release incidences. Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorination process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. T"

      "SummaryText": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. The plan must also include mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact on the public in the unlikely event of a release. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nThe Fort Collins Water Treatment Facility supplies water to the City of Fort Collins, Colorado. Surface water taken from the Poudre River and Horsetooth Reservoir is treated and disinfected at the FCWTF to EPA water quality standards and distributed to consumers. The water treatment process includes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The FCWTF produces up to 87 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water and the typical flow rate is within a range of 30 to 40 MGD. The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  Chlorine is used at FCWTF primarily to disinfect the drinking water prior to distribution. FCWTF has voluntarily installed a chlorine scrubber to operate in the event of a chlorine leak.  If a leak occurs, the chlorine leak scrubber will treat the chlorine in a manner that should not pose a threat to the outside environment.\n\nFCWTF takes safety very seriously and has not had a reportable incident related to chlorine since at latest June 21, 1994.\n\nThe FCWTF also produces and stores chlorine dioxide, which is listed under 40 CFR 68, but the maximum inventory is well under RMP threshold quantity. Thus, the chlorine dioxide process is not regulated under RMP rule. No other 40 CFR Part 68 chemicals are stored at the facility.\n\nThe RMP consist"

The chlorination process at the FCWTF is subject to Program 2, the second most stringent of the three programs, because the worst-case modeling includes public receptors within the impact area. The process however is not included in the specified standard industrial classification (SIC) codes and is not currently regulated under federal or state Process Safety Management (PSM) Requirements.\n\nProgram 2 of the RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the hazard assessment. The hazard assessment is performed to determine the effects of a release of a regulated substance could have on the public and is not included in this executive summary for security reasons. The second part is a prevention program that consists of seven elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the emergency response program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur.\n\nThe prevention program, together with the emergency response program, makes up the RMP. The prevention program consists of seven elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. These seven elements are outlined below followed by information regarding the emergency response program.\n\n1. SAFETY INFORMATION: The RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of an RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. If needed, the information can be supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine process area. All of the required process safety information was compiled as required by the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\n2. HAZARD REVIEW: A process hazard ana"

In addition, to obtain state licensure as a water treatment plant operator, it is required that the operator pass chlorine-related process and safety examinations.\n\nFCWTF staff have received initial training on the safety information and operations and maintenance of chlorine. In addition to the initial training, select FCWTF staff have been trained to respond to an accidental release. Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. Refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.\n\n5. MAINTENANCE: An effective maintenance program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release. The maintenance program addresses equipment testing and inspection and preventative maintenance schedules. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\n\nThe FCWTF maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system (maintenance data interface [MDI]) to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. The MDI system is also used to generate work orders for preventative maintenance. In addition to preventative maintenance, the FCWTF staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lock-out/tag-out or confined space entry provisions are applicable.\n\n6. COMPLIANCE AUDIT: The FCWTF is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP program. The primary goals of conducting an internal compliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify compliance with RMP requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase sa"

An internal compliance audit must be conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years beginning June 21, 1999, for the chlorine process. A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered process and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP requirements and audit techniques will conduct the audits. The Water Production Manager (WPM) and the audit team will promptly determine an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and document the corrective actions and the dates by which they must be taken.\n\n7. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION: Each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes.\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what equipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material leaked, reacted, or exploded? As part of the incident review, staff actions that may have contributed to the incident will also be reviewed. A determination will be made regarding whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees to prevent the incident from occurring in the future.
