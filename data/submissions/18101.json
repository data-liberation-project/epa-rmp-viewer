(Duke Facility) are committed to safe operations and prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental releasae, the facility will work with local Fire Departments, the LEPC, and Emergency Management Coordinator to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of a release on the community and the environment.\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n     The primary function of the facility is the storage and retail sale of Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers in the surrounding area.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored on-site at this facility would be 84,118 lbs in the 18,000 gallon capacity tank (based on 56%filling density).\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of 84,118 lbs of toxic gas in 10 minutes; distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.27 miles, using the DEGADIS Model and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.  The Alternative Scenario would be the release of 5,954 lbs per minute for a duration of 2 minutes, based on transfer hose failure;  distance to the toxic endpoint is .60 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe Facility has implemented the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68; ANSI K-61.1; 29 CFR 1910.111; 40 CFR Part 355, Emergency Planning & Community Right To Know.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that (a) have caused any deaths or significant property damage at the facility nor (b) to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n     This Facility has a written Emergency Response Plan, as prescribed in 40 CFR Part 68; 29 CFR 1910.120; and 40 CFR Part 355 (EPCRA).
