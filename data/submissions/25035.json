Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Midwest Farmers Cooperative (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for direct application fertilizer as a crop production nutrient.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in nurse tanks.  The largest nurse tank has a capacity of 2000 gallons.\n\nThe maximun quanity of ammonia stored would be 91,928 pounds\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a nrusr tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\nThe maximun quanity of anhydrous ammonia would be 8,205 pounds which represents the volume of the largest nruse tank at 75 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or PPM) is 1.6 miles.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 1 minute before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stop the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quanitity released would be 10 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .1 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standa"

The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: has caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Reponse Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.36;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.90, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Perodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.\n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
