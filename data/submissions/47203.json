      "SummaryText": "NGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Jesup Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of our workers and the safety of our processes.  There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  Currently, the entire mill is undergoing extensive training in  Behavior Based Safety to improve overall safety performance.  This program is entitled USA (Unified Safety Approach) and is underway with a steering committee guiding the effort.  The USA concept is based on changing worker safety behavior by individually conducting observations and providing feedback to other employees as they perform their duties. Incident investigations are also performed to improve safety.  These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers. Major efforts to improve our safety have continued with Jesup's SkillsNOW computer based training program.  This computer-based operating procedure/training system has been in place for several years for the Chlorine, Chlorine Dioxide and Sulfur Dioxide systems, which facilitates procedure changes and provides operators easier access to process information. Since 1995, the Jesup Annual Environmental, Safety and Health Continuous Improvement Plan has provided a focus for safety improvement. Mill-wide goals are established each year and each mill department is charged with developing an improvement plan that contributes to each element of the mill plan. Our Central Safety and Health Committee continues to provide the Jesup Mill with tangible safety improvements primarily based on active participation and suggestions from employees.  The mill is currently embarking on a two year assessment plan in pursuit of OSHA's VPP status.  \n\n\n7.0 CERTIFICATION\n\nRefer to the Form included with the RMP submittal.\n\n\n8.0 DATA ELEMENTS\n\nRefer to Section 1 Registration Information."

Maximum process quantity.  \n3) Sulfur Dioxide Process - Regulated substance Sulfur Dioxide. 66,700 lb. Maximum process quantity.\nChlorine and Chlorine Dioxide are used as pulp bleaching chemicals in our process. They are added directly to the pulp as dilute water solutions in carefully controlled bleach stages. Chlorine is used in two of our three mills while Chlorine Dioxide is used in all three mills. Sulfur Dioxide is added directly to the pulp as a dilute water solution and is used to control or stop chlorine reactions in pulp.  It is used in all three mills.\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn 1994, the Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill formalized their accidental release prevention program for eight chemical systems or processes. This program complied with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that for Program Level 3 processes, OSHA's PSM prevention program could be used to satisfy RMP prevention requirements provided that it was updated to reflect accidental releases with potential off-site impact. This update was accomplished for our three RMP covered processes during recent Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The following is a brief description of the key elements of our OSHA PSM prevention program. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION. A variety of technical documents are maintained and used to help ensure safe operation of the Jesup mill processes. Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Jesup mill. Engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design"

The Jesup mill ensures that this process safety information is available to all mill employees.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS. The Jesup mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) for each covered process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to perform these PHA's. PHA teams at the Jesup mill use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented by checklists, to perform the hazard analyses. A written summary report that contains recommendations for mill management review is prepared by the team. Mill management assigns responsibility for resolution of each recommendation.  Where appropriate, changes to improve the safety of the process are implemented. PHA's are performed on each covered process at least once every five years.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES. Jesup mill process engineers, project engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures for all covered processes. These procedures describe how operations should be safely performed under conditions of process start-up, normal operations, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown. Operating procedures are used both as operating guidelines and training tools. They are reviewed by Jesup mill management on an annual basis.  All operating procedures for covered systems reside on a computer based training network and are accessible by all employees via the mill's intranet. \n\nTRAINING. Jesup mill training focuses on general process descriptions, a reviews of the properties and hazards of the process chemicals and detailed process operating procedures and safe work practices.  This is accomplished using computer based training (CBT) for all covered processes. CBT modules have been developed for each covered process and include skills testing and testing record keeping.
