Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at Cairo Sulfur Products are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment. Employee training associated with the processes at our facility supports this effort. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with both the Allen County Emergency Services and Cairo Fire Department which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of sulfuric acid. We have one (1) RMP regulated substance present at our facility in significant quantity. The substance is oleum, a mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide. The regulated substance at our facility is involved in several uses. Oleum is used for producing sulfuric acid. \r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is contained as 40% oleum. To model using RMP Comp, the corresponding quantity of 30% oleum to contain the equivalent SO3 in our 40% oleum is used. This may result in a greater distance to endpoint but is more conservative. \r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our stationary source.  \r\n\r\nProc"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cairo Sulfur Products maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nCairo Sulfur Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nCairo Sulfur Products carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification using our Management of Change process.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cairo Sulfur Products. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nCairo Sulfur Products conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nCairo Sulfur Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nCairo Sulfur Products truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Cairo Sulfur Products has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nCairo Sulfur Products has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred during this period. \r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nCairo Sulfur Products carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \r\n\r\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program agencies to improve communication and site-specific knowledge are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility."
