If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  2.Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed.  The maximum quantity stored would be 56100 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank.  3.  The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenario:  a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 56100 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.8 miles.  B. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a relief valve.  The distance to endpoint. ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1 miles.   4. The accidental release prevention program:  The facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage & Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111, \" Storage & Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"   5.  The Five year Accident History  -  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.
