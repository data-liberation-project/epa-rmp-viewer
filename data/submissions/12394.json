Inc. recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Denver facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). Mr. Mark Day, Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as nece"

Inc. facility follows the following corporate and site-specific safety guidelines:\n\n \tJackson employee handbook plant safety rules\n \tJackson contractor safety program\n \tKroger Behavioral Based Safety Process \n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJackson Ice Cream Co. Inc. is part of the Kroger Company.  The facility manufactures ice cream and frozen dessert items.   It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 16,200 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Jackson Ice Cream Co. Inc. facility involves the release of 16,200 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the ammonia storage receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it would be at most 35-40% full under normal operating conditions.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and qualit"

Inc. facility involves the release of 3780 pounds of ammonia over a 15 minute period due to the pressure relief valve sticking open on the main storage receiver.  Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief valves;\n\t \tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\t \tThe facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the system; \n\t \tThe facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n\t \tThe facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing system isolation valves .\n\nD.
