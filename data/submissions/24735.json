      "SummaryText": "aintains on site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Wayne Farms LLC - Union Springs uses EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (8,925 pounds in 10 minutes), a .6  mile radius around the facility would have to be evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 46 people in the surrounding community should be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.  \n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nProcess piping leaks could result in 260 pounds of ammonia at 11 lbs/min over a twenty five minute period.   According to EPA's OCA Guidance Models, this 260 pounds of ammonia should travel less than .1 miles and may effect 1 member of the general public.  \n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms LLC  believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms has taken to minimize or eliminate these dangers.  Wayne Farms LLC - Union Springs has had a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Bullock County."
