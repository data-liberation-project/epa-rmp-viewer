      "SummaryText": "G.S. ROBINS AND COMPANY\n\nG.S. Robins and Company is a St. Louis-based, chemical distribution company with branch locations throughout the Midwest.  G.S. Robins has specialized in serving the unique chemical needs of the Midwest.  The company is involved with basic commodity distribution, transloading, custom blending, high quality distribution, custom packaging, and dry product particle size modification.  All blending, transloading, packaging and product particle size modification take place at this Home Office facility.   The branch locations are distribution warehouses.  The distribution warhouses move material, but do not work direclty with the chemicals.\n\nG.S. Robins and Company is a long time member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  Through the NACD, G.S. Robins has committed and pledged to constantly improve the management and handling of chemicals by following the \"Responsible Distribution Process(RDP)\".  RDP is a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety, and environmental performance of all member companies.  G.S. Robin's implementation of the RDP includes a commitment to comply with relevant environmental health and safety regulations.  The senior management at G.S. Robins has formally accepted these guiding principles.\n\nRDP includes guiding principles for all aspects of environmental health and safety.  These include:  communication with emergency response officials, operating our facilities in a safe manner, respond to community concerns about chemicals, and to make health, safety and the environment a priority.  In order to verify that G.S. Robins has complied with the guidling principles of RDP, the NACD conducts a third party verification.  The on-site verification is conducted by a third party.  The third party audits G.S. Robins every three years.\n\nThe primary activities at the St. Louis facility consist of the following:  bulk chemical repackaging, drum and IBC storage, transloading, and custom b"

      "SummaryText": "lending.  G.S. Robins has six of the 140 chemicals identified by the EPA above the threshold quantity.  These chemicals are:  sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid and chlorine.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for G.S. Robins involves chlorine.  Chlorine is stored on-site in three different types of containers.  These container are:  2,000 lb. cylinder, 150 lb. cylinder and 100 lb. cylinder.  The worst-case scenario demostrates all of the chlorine on-site being released at one time.  The maximum amount on-site is 35,300 pounds.  The scenario would be either a fire or explosion causing all of the cylinders to release at one time.  The scenario has a Toxic Endpoint of 6.2 miles (offisite impact radius).   The modeling was done using the EPA COMP program.  The liklihood of this scenario taking place is remote.  \n\nThe alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins consist of problems that are more likely to happen.  As a chemical distributor, we move a large quantity of chemicals.  During the moving or storage of a chemical, there is always the chance that a container could begin leaking.  The leaking could be caused by several factors.  These factors include:  overfilling, mishandling, jostling during transportation or just a leak.  The following are the alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins.  These alternative scenarios were completed on the EPA COMP modeling program.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR OUTDOOR CHEMICAL STORAGE\nThe outdoor chemical storage consists of storage tanks and cylinders.  The on-site storage tanks are used to store bulk chemicals and fill drums and totes.  The cylinders are stored on site to ship to G.S. Robins outlying branches or directly to customers.  The Alternative Scenarios represent incidents that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  G.S. Robins moves a large amount of material through the facility each year.  The types of incidents that are likely to occur are:  drum leaks, tote leaks, and leaks in "
