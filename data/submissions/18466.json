      "SummaryText": "The Clarkson Gas Plant produces natural gas liquids (NGL) from gas feed.  The plant consists of a skid-mounted cryogenic unit, a deethanizer, a regenerator, and compressor engines.  The facility is capable of processing up to 20 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas; however, it currently only processes between 10 and 14 mmscf/d of natural gas and produces 200,000 barrels per year of NGL.  The Clarkson Gas Plant is located in a remote area near the City of Sonora, Texas.  The following is a summary of the facility's risk management program.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Clarkson Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker protection and public safety, as demonstrated through the accidental release and emergency response programs implemented at the Plant.  These programs provide information regarding personnel training in accidental release and response procedures, process operations, and health and safety practices; written operation and maintenance procedures for each process; hazard analysis and response; and hazard communication.  It is the Star Natural Gas Company's (SNGC) policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, as well as train personnel to respond, control, and mitigate releases, if necessary.   \n\n2. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Clarkson Gas Plant is designed to produce natural gas liquids (NGL).  Dry, sweet, natural gas is received by pipeline and processed by a skid mounted cryogenic unit, which lowers the temperature of the natural gas to form NGL.  The residue natural gas goes to a sales pipeline, and the NGL are stored on-site prior to being trucked to a sales point.  Although the facility is capable of processing up to 20 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas, it currently processes 10 to 14 mmscf/d of natural gas on an annual basis and produces 200,000 barrels per year of NGL.  \n\nNatural gas liqui"

      "SummaryText": "ds are  the regulated substance that is processed and stored at the facility in amounts above the threshold limit.  Approximately 200,000 bbls/yr of NGL is produced annually.\n\n3. OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nThe EPA-RMP*Comp Model was used to predict the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for flammable substances present at the Clarkson Gas Plant.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for toxic substances were not determined due to the absence of threshold quantities of toxic substances.\n\nFlammable Substance\nWorst-case:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is defined by the regulations as an  instantaneous release of the flammable substance, in this case  NGL, and a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario is based on the assumption that if the pressure of the tank is reduced as a result of the incident, the entire quantity of the flammable substance will vaporize.  Therefore, the use of passive mitigation systems, such as storage tank containment dikes, are not applicable in this case, as liquids are not released.  It is predicted that a worst-case release will have an off-site impact.  The end point or point at which the vapor cloud is reduced to 1 psi overpressure is estimated to be at a distance of 0.3 miles from the Plant.   SNGC maintains a series of safety devices on the system (e.g. high pressure alarms) which make it extremely unlikely that the worst case scenario would occur.\n\nAlternative-case:\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for flammable substances at the Clarkson Gas Plant consists of the rupture of the NGL pressurized storage tank.  This scenario differs from the worst-case secnario in that it is assumed that a smaller volume of NGL is being stored in the tank and that this volume is released to the ground.  Passive mitigation measures, such as the use of storage tank containment dikes, will contain the liquids, if present.  However, in this case, it is assumed that the NGL will vaporize due to the a"

Technical documents describing process operations and process design and construction are available to all employees, including operators, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team members, training coordinators, contractors, pre-startup safety review team members, and emergency preparedness team members.  These documents describe the properties and hazards of all process chemicals and include specific chemical inventories; the limits of key process parameters; and the equipment design basis/configuration including the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written safety procedures and trained personnel, provide the basis for developing and implementing all inspection and maintenance procedures, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Clarkson Gas Plant has developed a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with process operations are identified and controlled.  In this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards should it become necessary.  Process operations are evaluated using the what-if checklist method by a team of employees who are familiar with the operation and maintenance and the engineering specifications of each process.  The team identifies the potential hazards associated with each process, evaluates the existing accident prevention and mitigation measures for each process, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary.  The PHA team findings are then forwarded to manag"

This risk ranking method ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All management-approved mitigation measures identified by the PHA team are tracked from start to finish.  The final resolution of each PHA team finding is documented and retained in the PHA files.\n\nThe PHA team conducts a hazard analysis review every five years for the life of the process to ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features.  The results and findings of these PHA reviews are documented and retained in the PHA files and are forwarded to management for consideration.  The final resolution of each PHA team finding is documented and retained in the PHA files.   \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Clarkson Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures for all process operations.  These procedures include specific instructions and details pertaining to safety precautions, process hazards, and process operations.  The operating procedures manual is written in a clear, concise tone so that it is applicable to both new and experienced operators.\n\nTraining\nThe Clarkson Gas Plant has developed a comprehensive process operation and safety training program for its employees.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safety at the time of hire.  All other employees receive refresher training on process operations and safety on an annual basis to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\n\nContractors\nThe Clarkson Gas Plant has developed operation and safety procedures for contractors that work at the facility during periods of increased maintenance or construction.
