A total of\r\napproximately 2.3 million pounds of propellant may be stored, at any one time, in the DC. Finished\r\ngoods are transferred to the DC for interim storage prior to shipment to retail stores.\r\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\nFor the Worst-Case Scenario, the aerosol can contents are considered non-toxic, but flammable and\r\na highly explosive gas. The mixture within each aerosol can is propellant (the n-Propane and\r\nIsobutane), flammable liquid solvents and paint solids, with each can containing approximately 16-oz\r\nof this flammable mixture. As the propellant is the more flammable/explosive component in the\r\naerosol can, the entire 16-oz is assumed all propellant in a 65/35 weight % split n-Propane to\r\nIsobutane. The individual aerosol cans are stored in cardboard cases, 6 per case. 274 cases are\r\nstored on a single pallet. The pallets are then stacked no more than 2 high in multiple rows within\r\nthe DC. A single pallet of aerosol cans was considered a single vessel, with the instantaneous\r\nrelease of the mixture in all the aerosol cans on the pallet as a Worst-Case Scenario.\r\nThe Offsite Consequence distance to an over pressure of 1 psi was determined using equation C-2\r\nprovided in Appendix C of the OCAG guidance document; dated April 15, 1999. No administrative\r\ncontrols or passive mitigation systems were considered in this scenario. The heat of combustion\r\nvalues were obtained from Exhibit C-1 of Appendix C of the OCAG guidance document. The\r\nfollowing values were used in the calculations: 45,719 kJ/kg for Isobutane and 46,333 kJ/kg for n-\r\nPropane.\r\nBecause the site qualifies for the RMP Program 1 requirements,"

      "SummaryText": "no alternative release scenario was\r\nrequired to be assessed.\r\nOFF-SITE IMPACT\r\nThe endpoint distance from the worst-case release scenario, 0.095 miles (501 feet), does not extend\r\nbeyond the property line. Therefore, no public or environmental\r\nreceptors are impacted.\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of the covered flammable substances at the Kenosha\r\nDC facility in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury or significant property damage onsite;\r\nor off-site death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental\r\ndamage.\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by the RMP rule for Program 1\r\nprocesses, a number of design and operational controls are in place to decrease the severity or\r\nprevent the occurrence of a fire or explosion. The most significant controls are described below:\r\n1. The warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance with the National Fire\r\nProtection Association (NFPA) Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol\r\nProducts code (NFPA 30B).\r\n2. Aerosol storage is limited to a maximum height of 15 feet, i.e., 2 pallets.\r\n3. The pallets of aerosol cans are stored separate from other flammable liquids and separated by\r\na 2 hour minimum rated fire wall.\r\n4. A newly installed fire system including foam delivery system has been installed in the facility. \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan is maintained at the facility and reviewed annually to\r\nupdate and/or make recommended improvements to site safety."
