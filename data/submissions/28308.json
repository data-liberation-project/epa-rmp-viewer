Founded in 1924, UNIVAR supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc . is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by UNIVAR are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  UNIVAR USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to UNIVAR  facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  UNIVAR responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incident"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have one RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substance is Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70%.  Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substance is stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Hydrofluoric Acid 70% onsite at any one time will be 13000 POUNDS\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RMP substances in inventory onsite. Each RMP liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes. By using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed .Listed below are the maximum distances in miles and the corresponding toxic endpoint of mg/L for each individual RMP substance inventoried onsite using the above conditions.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is       the What-If technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, UNIVAR USA Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, no"

Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at UNIVAR USA Inc to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at UNIVAR USA Inc.
