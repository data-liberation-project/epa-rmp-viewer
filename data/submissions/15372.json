IPG must comply with the Chemical Accident Prevention rule issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act.  A Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required for the IPG facility.\nIPG has the potential to store approximately 30,000 pounds of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) at their facility at a given time.  The TDI is stored in 55-gallon drums weighing approximately 450 pounds each.  All of the drums are stored in a designated warehouse as shown in Figure 2.\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of TDI from the process, entry within distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged within the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n        Mr. Jay Alconta    \nSign"

IPG must comply with the Chemical Accident Prevention rule issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act.

The TDI is stored in 55-gallon drums weighing approximately 450 pounds each.  All of the drums are stored in a designated warehouse as shown in Figure 2.\nIPG uses all reasonable safety evaluations and training requirements to ensure the proper offloading, storage, and transport of TDI.  In case of an emergency, it is IPG's policy to immediately notify the City of Columbia Fire Department by calling 911.  It is also IPG's policy to notify the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Richland County Emergency Preparedness Office, the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) DHEC, and the National Response Center (NRC).\nIPG has modeled the worse case release scenario as a total release of one 55-gallon drum with an approximate weight of 450 pounds of TDI.  Using EPA approved model, RMP*Comp, the results of the consequence analysis estimated the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 0.1 miles.  The IPG facility is located in a fairly remote, industrial area, the 0.1 mile radius of impact does not include any public receptors.  The facility has access restrictions to the public such as a fully fenced site, security guard, and identification badges must be obtained before entering the area.\n 3.0    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nThe modeled results of the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) performed for the process at IPG indicates that it is eligible for Program 1 level.

      "SummaryText": " release scenario is offered. \n3.1    Worst-Case Release Scenario\nA worst-case release is defined by Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Regulations as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is the distance a toxic vapor cloud from an accidental release of TDI will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will not occur. The RMP* Comp model uses the three following assumptions to calculate the distance to end point:\n7 Wind speed of 1.5 miles per hour,\n7 Designated stability class F, and\n7 A temperature of 770 Fahrenheit.\nIPG has the potential to store a total 30,000 pounds of TDI at one central location.  The TDI is received and stored in 55-gallon drums weighing approximately 450 pounds each.  Using the worse-case release definition, the RMP* Comp model, and the data elements shown in Table 1, the estimated distance to endpoint is a 0.1 miles radius with the center at IPG's warehouse location.  A graphical representation of the area affected is shown in Figure 3.\n\nTABLE 1\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO DATA ELEMENTS\n\nData Element    \nChemical Name    Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified polymer)\nCAS No.    26471-62-5\nScenario    Worst-Case Release\nQuantity released    450 pounds\nRelease area    20,000 square foot building\nToxic endpoint    0.0070 mg/L\nDistance to endpoint    0.1 miles\nSince the toxic distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles does not affect any public receptors and the effects on people beyond the endpoint are not considered to be severe enough, IPG is eligible for Program 1.No additional action needs to be taken under the RMP rule.\n 4.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIPG has not, within the last five years, had any release of TDI at its facility.\n 5.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\nIPG policies dictate that all reasonable steps be taken to insure the safety of its employees and environment.
