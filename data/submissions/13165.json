We maintain up to 45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure in a horizontal storage tank adjacent to the production unit for which it is used.\n\nThe worst case release would involve the entire 45,000 pounds of ammonia release over a 10 minute period.  The resultant cloud would reach offsite public receptors, including schools, hospitals, and office buildings.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a broken transfer line from the storage tank into the process building.  A release rate up to 1000lbs/min could occur before the Automatic Excess Flow Valves would shut down the system at the tank.  This rate of release would barely get off site and affected receptors would be minimal.\n\nThe storage tank is provided with Excess Flow Valves, Pressure Relief Valves and Safety Shut-Off Valves.  Physical protection is provided in the form of concrete posts and fencing around the tank and metal barriers for piping into the building.\n\nTo prevent the unintentional release of anhydrous ammonia, and any other chemical, United Catalysts Inc has developed an accident prevention program.  Key components of this program include:\n7 Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP\u0012s) for all aspects of production and maintenance tasks that take into account safety, health and environmental concerns.\n7 Thorough training for all personnel.\n7 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA\u0012s) conducted on all new and modified processes.  A re-evaluation is conducted on the ammonia system every 5 years.\n7 Routine Maintenance and Inspection is performed on operating equipment at specified intervals\n7 A Management of Change (MOC) system is in place to follow all process changes and prevent the introduction of an inadvertent hazard to an existing process.\n7 Contractor training and drug screening prior to working in the plant\n7 Incident Investigation program to determine the root cause of an in"

Trained operators will attempt to stop the flow of ammonia using the existing emergency shutoff valves.  At the same time, local emergency response units will be summoned by calling 911.  Depending on the severity of the release, the call to 911will initiate the community warning sirens.\n\nUCI is currently conducting research which would minimize or eliminate the need for anhydrous ammonia."
