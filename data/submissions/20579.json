      "SummaryText": "The community of Frazer is located within the southwest corner of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation along U.S. Highway No. 2.  Approximately twenty (20) miles west of Wolf Point and approximately twenty-nine (29) miles east of Glasgow, within Valley county, in the State of Montana.  Frazer has 115 service connections, store, gas station, community center, Head Start center, Senior Citizen center, three churches, bar, post office, and a school (approximately 150 students), for grades K - 12, uses approximately 65,000 gallons of water per day.  The water is pumped from four different well sources within the community.  Frazer community is sustained by farming, ranching, and basic services.  In addition, to the farmland and rangeland, there are some wetlands along the Little Porcupine creek on the west edge of Frazer. The original water system was designed and constructed in 1968 and consisted of one well, pump house, controls, a distribution system (4\" watermains) and a storage facility.  The storage facility consists of a 75,000 gallon elevated tower.  Four (4) additional wells were added to the system years later.  One of these wells is not currently connected to the system.  The pump house has a chlorinator system that was installed in 1992, upon bacteriological contamination.  The chlorinator system consists of a fifty (50) gallon solution tank, a positive-displacement pump with back-pressure relief/ anti-siphon valve assembly.  The chlorine unit, is a metering pump that  can be regulated between internal and external pulsing by means of a switch with a frequency control knob.  The pump drive is totally encapsulated in a chemical resistant housing to provide for maximum protection against chemical spillage.  The chemical metering pump valves are ball check valves seated on combination valve seat and seal ring, that are routinely checked and replaced as they get worn..  The four function valve assembly provides protection against chemical overloading and spillage, w"
