      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nChester Water Authority (CWA) owns and operates the Octoraro Water Treatment Plant (Octoraro WTP), which is located in Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Waters from the Octoraro Reservoir and the Susquehanna River are treated at this facility to federal and state drinking water standards.  Water pumped from the Octoraro WTP supplies approximately 200,000 customers located in southern Chester and western Delaware County of Pennsylvania as well as northeastern Delaware.\n\nChlorine gas is used to disinfect the water in the treatment processes at the Octoraro WTP.  If accidentally released to the air in significant quantity, chlorine gas is extremely hazardous.  CWA carefully stores and handles the chlorine it uses at the Octoraro WTP to prevent its accidental release.  \n\nThe chlorine gas used at the Octoraro WTP is purchased as a compressed liquefied gas in standard one-ton containers from commercial suppliers. Liquid chlorine from a one-ton container flows to evaporators where the liquid is warmed and converted to a gas.  The chlorine gas is regulated, metered and pulled by vacuum into chemical feed lines that distribute chlorine/water solution to the treatment process. Only one container is in use at any given time.  However, when fully stocked, the Octoraro WTP may have 23 one-ton containers or 46,000 pounds of chlorine on site. This exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds established under the RMP regulations. \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describes the chemical hazards associated with chlorine and explains what CWA is doing to prevent an accidental release.  It has been developed and implemented in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) and guidelines specifically created for water treatment plants (AWWARF Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants).

      "SummaryText": "ase Prevention, and Emergency Response programs for chlorine are described in the following subsections.\n\nThe Octoraro WTP also uses ammonia, but the maximum inventory is below the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds; therefore, CWA's ammonia use is not regulated under RMP. \n\n2  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Chester Water Authority has a policy that addresses its commitment to accident prevention and risk management. This policy reads as follows:\n\n\"The Chester Water Authority is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  CWA will implement safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at its facilities.  If there is an accidental release, CWA will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response to minimize the effect of the release. CWA will also immediately notify the public, through county emergency management agencies, of actions necessary to ensure public protection.\"\n\n3. WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nCWA has conducted an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case release scenario.  As required by the RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as a ten-minute release of the greatest quantity of the regulated substance contained in any single vessel or pipeline.  For CWA's Octoraro WTP, this greatest quantity is the 2,000-pound contents of a standard one-ton chlorine container.  Consequently, the worst-case release is 200 pounds per minute of chlorine for ten minutes.\n\nAlthough the chlorine is stored and used indoors, which can reduce the rate of release and the potential impact distance, it was conservatively assumed to be released outdoors.  In addition, the regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance.  A release dispersio"

      "SummaryText": "n model is used to project the distance to an \"endpoint\" concentration of the released compound.  For the offsite consequence analyses required by the RMP regulations, this endpoint concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The endpoint (ERPG-2 value) established for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nFor the rural setting of the Octoraro WTP, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration for the worst-case release is 3.0 miles.  This distance was obtained from the American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF) Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants and is based on dispersion modeling that meets the RMP requirements for the worst-case release conditions.  Because wind direction varies, a chlorine release could migrate in any direction.  As a result, the area that could be above this concentration is assumed to be a circle with a three-mile radius centered at the Octoraro WTP.  With wind blowing in one direction, modeling predicts that only an oval-shaped area directly downwind of the plant would be impacted.  In an actual release, distance and direction will vary based on actual weather conditions and terrain, because chlorine is a dense gas that flows downhill.\n\nThere are approximately 3,600 residents within the three-mile radius for the worst-case scenario based on the area within the circle and 1990 Census data.  However, if the worst-case release occurred, only a portion of these residents, those that are located downwind or down hill of the Octoraro WTP, would be in the aff"

Other public receptors within the three-mile radius include a small  Amish school, some small-scale commercial operations, several churches and three recreation areas (the Octoraro Reservoir  area, the Pine Grove Covered Bridge area and Girl Scout Camp Tweedale).  There are no hospitals, prisons, or major office or industrial areas within this impact area. There are no environmental receptors (i.e., national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas) within the impact area.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is unlikely because of the design of one-ton containers and the maintenance and prevention programs in place at the Octoraro WTP.  Additionally, release reporting databases and industry experience also indicate that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is unlikely and  should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in Subsection 4 below.\n\n4. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe alternate release scenario selected was the release of liquid chlorine from the bottom valve of a one-ton container. This scenario was selected from those provided in AWWARF'S Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants because it represents an accident that is feasible for the Octoraro WTP and because it meets the RMP requirement that the impact distance for the alternate release must extend offsite unless no such scenario exists.  \n\nThis alternate release could be caused by several plausible accidents including a container valve failure, or a faulty or improperly connected flexible connection.  This scenario assumes that the valve is wide open and the connectio"

This would result in releasing a gas and aerosol mixture of chlorine, at a rate of approximately 69 pounds per minute for up to 31 minutes.  Most incidents of this kind involve lower release rates due to partially stuck open valves and/or leaking (not removed) connections. \n\nFor the rural setting of the Octoraro WTP, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration for this alternate release is 1.5 miles. There are approximately 800 residents within this potential impact area; however, only portion of these residents, those that are located downwind of the release, would typically be in the affected area.  Other public receptors within this area include a small Amish school, some small-scale commercial operations, two churches and three recreation areas (the Octoraro Reservoir  area, the Pine Grove Covered Bridge area and Girl Scout Camp Tweedale).  There are no hospitals, prisons, major office or industrial areas or environmental receptors within this impact area.  As with the worst-case scenario, actual distances and directions vary with terrain and weather conditions.\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, CWA's Octoraro Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidental chlorine releases that resulted in injuries or damages. Under the RMP regulations, all accidental releases of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\" within the past 5 years must be reported.  \n\n6. PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, three levels of prevention program requirements have been established to roughly match the level of effort to the risk of off-site impacts.
