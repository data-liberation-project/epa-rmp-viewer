The Rixie Terminal complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Pulaski County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Rixie Terminal is a bulk terminal that receives propane by pipeline.  Propane is stored at the Rixie Terminal and distributed by customer truck transports.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Rixie Terminal has developed and implemented the following general accidental release and prevention program elements in accordance with all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) accident prevention rule, all the elements of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, NFPA-58 and all codes and regulations:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The Rixie Terminal has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes.  The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.  The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made.\n\nAccurate and complete process safety information enables the Rixie Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Rixie Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved"

Additionally, any new units added at the Rixie Terminal which is considered PSM covered processes will also require a PSSR to be performed and documented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:   The Rixie Terminal has developed and implemented procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of critical process equipment in accordance with NFPA 58 and industry recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nInspections and tests are documented and deficiencies outside of the acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner.  \n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:  The Rixie Terminal has developed and implemented safe work practices that include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.\n\nTraining:  The Rixie Terminal has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or loading a truck transport.  The training programs may include classroom, practical and computer-based training.  Employees are tested to demonstrate their understand of the training and competency.\n\nManagement of Change:  The Rixie Terminal requires that a management of change (MOC) be performed for any modification to equipment, procedures, products and process parameters of a PSM covered process.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The Rixie Terminal requires that any inci"
