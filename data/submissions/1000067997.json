This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal, located in Gaines County, Texas, is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline system, propane storage/loading facility and underground cavern storage facility.  The Fractionation facility receives a mixed (Y-Grade) hydrocarbon liquid stream via pipeline and separates these liquids into relatively pure component streams via a fractional distillation plant.  The fractionated ethane, propane (or Ethane/Propane mix), iso-butane, normal butane and gasoline products are removed from the fractionation facility via pipeline. The terminal truck loading facility receives propane from a propane pipeline and delivers the propane into trucks for wholesale delivery.  The Hobbs terminal and fractionation facility is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal has a number of interstate Department of Transportation regulated pipelines, plus additional intrastate pipelines, that are routed through the facility.  These pipelines are mixed natural gas liquid lines (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), an "

All of the pipelines, pumps and the underground storage at the facility are regulated by the Department of Transportation and are exempt from the RMP Regulation.  \n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered from a D.O.T. regulated pipelines and routed from these pipelines to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers.  The fractionation facility contains flammable methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane, normal pentane and propylene in a closed cooling system.

No alternate case scenario is reported for the facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Hobbs Terminal and Fractionation Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal and Fractionation Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.
