We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental       \n  chemical releases\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs \n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \n  from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n* The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Ammonium Bisulfite, Sulfuric Acid, Oleum, Sulfur Dioxide, and Sulfur Trioxide using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our process, we produce or consume the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\nOleum - 966,000 lbs. storage, used as a finished product and in the manufacture of sulfur dioxide\nSulfur Dioxide - 1,572,000 lbs. storage, used as a finished product\nSulfur Trioxide - 783,525 lbs. storage, used as a finished product\nAmmon"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe failure of one storage tank containing 288,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide released over a ten-minute period.  The release would potentially impact public and environmental receptors.     \n\nThis scenario does not allow consideration of various process controls such as automatic shutoffs that would limit the duration of the release.  Another mitigating system not considered is the Chicago Code required containment dikes that would reduce the surface area of the spill and dramatically reduce the impact distance.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n1.  A truck loading hose rupture releasing 667 pounds of oleum over a 1/2 minute period before loader/operator activates the emergency shutdown system that turns off the loading pump and closes the loading valve to prevent further release.  The release would potentially impact public and environmental receptors.   \n\n\n2.  A truck loading hose rupture releasing 800 pounds of sulfur dioxide over a 1/2 minute period before loader/operator activates the emergency shutdown system that turns off the loading pump and closes the loading valve to prevent further release.  The truck being loaded is also equipped with an excess flow valve which would close automatically or be activated by the driver, whichever occurs first.  The area of"

      "SummaryText": " the spill would also be contained within a berm which surrounds the loading area and truck/trailer. The release would potentially impact public and environmental receptors. \n\n\n3.  A truck loading hose rupture releasing 1190 pounds of sulfur trioxide over a 1/2 minute period before loader/operator activates the emergency shutdown system that turns off the loading pump and closes the loading valve to prevent further release.  The release would potentially impact public and environmental receptors.\n\n4. A truck unloading hose rupture releasing 500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 1/2 minute period before the trailer passive shutoff device and ammonia storage excess flow valve and/or check valves shut off the ammonia flow from the trailer and storage to prevent further release. The release would potentially impact public and environmental receptors.\n\nIn all of the above alternative release scenarios, 1/2 minute is the maximum estimated response time since loader/operators and drivers must remain within 25 feet of the loading system as required by both DOT regulations and PVS mandatory operating procedures.  Loading hoses undergo an extensive inspection process that involves routine, periodic testing and/or replacement.  \n\nWe are using the above scenario information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n4.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of sucessful prevention programs including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup safety review\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permits\n* Contractors \n\nAs part of our prevent"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n  \n5.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  PVS Chemicals (IL) has not had any accidental chemical releases involving offsite consequences or on-site injuries or damage from materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years.\n\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive contingency plan which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Continuous improvement program to evaluate chemical safety and release prevention systems\n \n\n8.0  CERTIFICATION\nFor certification of this plan as required by EPA's RMP rule, see the certification statement accompanying the diskette.\n\n9.0  RMP DATA ELEMENTS\n\nThe following pages present"
