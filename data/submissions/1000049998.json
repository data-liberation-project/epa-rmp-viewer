The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facilities:\r\nIt is the intention of Western management to commit to personal, property and environmental safety to all surrounding life and environment that could possible be affected in any manner by the business conducted at this facility.\r\nOur Policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.  To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required for personal safety.  Our objective is the safety program reducing our exposure to accidents to the absolute minimum. Our goal is ZERO accidents and injuries.\r\nInternal Safety Audits are done at least 2 times a year to insure compliance with all regulations and safety practices. \r\n\r\nB.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nWestern manufactures Acetylene at this facility.  This process is accomplished through the use of an acetylene generator in which Calcium Carbide is mixed with water to produce acetylene gas which is then purified, dried and pumped to various size cylinders.  These cylinders are shipped to our other locations for resale.  \r\n\r\nAcetylene is pumped from the generator to the compressors at approximately 8 p.s.i..  From the compressors the acetylene is pumped to the cylinders at between 200 and 300 p.s.i..   All of the cylinders contain a specific amount of acetone depending on the size of the cylinder being filled.  The acetone and acetylene chemically bond so that the acetylene is suspended in a stable condition for transport and use.   Because of the number of different size cylinders this facility can fill, the measurements taken were based on maximum potential size of the cylinders that are filled at the same time.\r\n\r\nC.  The worst case scenario was evaluated by the number of large cylinders expected on site at any one time.  If a large cylinder has 75#'s of acetylene and acetone in"

      "SummaryText": "each cylinder and we have approximately 200 large cylinders it would give us 15,000 lbs on our worse case scenario.\r\nThe alternate case scenario was if the generator itself were to have a vapor cloud fire.  The total volume for the alternate case scenario would be 375#'s of acetylene.\r\n\r\nD.  The accidental release prevention program complies with OSHA-PSM, EPA-RMP and NFPA regulations and guidelines.  Our facilities have multiple gas detectors set at 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL). We have deluge sprinkler systems to mitigate a release of it occurred.\r\n\r\nE.  The five year accident history:  No accidents have occurred in the last five years at this facility.\r\n\r\nF.  The emergency response program:\r\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the local Fire Department to familiarize them with our facility and products.  The inventory information is also communicated to the Fire Dept and LEPC via Tier 2 reports.\r\nAll Western personnel receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually.  Monthly safety meetings are held for all employees.  Alert systems within the facility consist of word of mouth, an air horn, and by handheld cellular phones.\r\n\r\nG.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nThere are no planned changes at this time as it is the intention of management and this company to continue to train and strive for excellence in the industrial gas business.  We believe that properly trained personnel are safe personnel and therefore we have no intentions of reducing the importance of safety.  Safety First will remain the policy for this company."
