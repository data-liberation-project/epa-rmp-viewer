The preparatory effort consisted of the review of current P&IDs and block flow diagrams, process safety information, and identification of all components.  To separate plant processes, the hazard analysis was divided into manageable sections, or nodes, during the P&ID review.\n\n\n\nThe team was assembled and PHA training was completed prior to performing the PHA. The purpose of the Process Hazard Analysis and the methods to be used were reviewed. \n\n\n\nMembers of the PHA team were selected by choosing those who possessed the most experience and resources to conduct accurate analyses of the covered processes. Specific job experience was considered when assembling the Team so that Management, Operations and Safety were adequately represented.  The PHA was conducted the week of May 30, 2016. \n\n\n\nThe Team sourced the records and documents listed in Section 5 of this document during the Process Hazard Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in Volume 2 of the Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  The Airgas Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, including PSM/RMP related deliverables and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nPropane and propylene are the regulated substances that are managed at the Airgas fill plant in Henderson, Kentucky.  Airgas trucks pick up returned (empty) propane and propylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propane is stored at the stationary source in two 1,000 gallon bulk tanks connected by process piping.  Propylene is also stored at the stationary source in two "

The Airgas Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention practices that are specific to propane and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered process had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within the past 5 years.  In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 222 for additional information or and updated information.\n\n\n\nPersonnel associated with the stationary source will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 228 and Appendix Tab 312 for additional information.\n\n\n\nImplementation of the PSM/RMP processes created significant improvements to safety at the facility.  Refer to the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log for additional information.  At the time this Executive Summary was written, there were no additional plans for improvement.  Future improvements will be summarized on the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that there are potential negative consequences that will not be conside"
