The injection point is the boundary of the system that is regulated by CalARP.\n \nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nPer the CalARP Regulations one worst case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.  This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook. \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety systems to make the worst case type of event not credible.  In addition to the safety practices and personnel of the facility, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  As ammonia is \u00bfself alarming\u00bf due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\n\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\n\u00bf\tPre-startup Safety Review\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit\n\u00bf\tContractors\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan (BEP).  The entire prevention program elements are kept in the CalARP/EPA/RMP Compliance Workbook located onsite.  The prevention program elements satisfy the requirements of CalARP, EPA RMP, and OSHA PSM.\n\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no CalARP applicable releases of ammonia at the Ampersand Chowchilla Biomass LLC in at least the past five years.

      "SummaryText": "Ampersand Chowchilla Biomass LLC is located approximately 2.5 miles south west of CA-99, and 2 miles north of CA-152.\nThe facility has developed a Risk Management Program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785).  The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant. The facility has a qualified Anhydrous Ammonia Contractor to assist with their maintenance. \n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia NOx Reduction system. The facility\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Ammonia NOx Reduction system is used to maintain the concentration of NOx in the exhaust from a Biomass burner arrangement at acceptable levels.  No chemical reactions occur during the storage of an Ammonia NOx Reduction system; ammonia injection into exhaust stack is outside the scope of the regulation and therefore is not included.  The operation of an Ammonia NOx Reduction system requires controlling the ammonia (NH3) pressure for proper injection into the system.  The Ammonia is stored in a vessel and kept at required pressure through the use of a vaporizer that withdraws liquid ammonia from the bottom of the tank, vaporizes the liquid and returns the vapor into the storage tank.  The tank has welded pipe t"
