This policy is our basis to build trust between Arclin and our stakeholders. We will at all times strive to\n\n- Ensure that health and safety are our first priority.\n\n- Minimize harmful environmental impacts.\n\n- Base our work on openness and continuous improvement.\n\n- Develop products, services, & operations with consistent quality, which are environmentally preferred and safe.\n\n- Implement this policy according to health, safety, environment & quality management systems based on ISO or equivalent standards.  \n\n\n\nFacility Information;\n\nThe primary activities at the Arclin USA Springfield site are the production of formaldehyde solution and the production of proprietary thermosetting resins which are used primarily in wood adhesives applications. Formaldehyde is produced in a continuous process from methanol. The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 52% by weight. Aqua ammonia is used in the resin production process. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia stored in one vessel is 104,580 lbs at a concentration of 30% by weight. Resins are produced in batch operations and are shipped to customers by truck.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program;\n\nAll PSM covered processes at the Arclin Springfield site are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM-required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Arclin program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be "

      "SummaryText": "that the compliance audit procedures required as part of  Arclin's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History;\n\nThe Arclin, Springfield site, has had no accidental releases of ammonia or formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program;\n\nArclin has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for coordinating with local emergency response agencies, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and outlines procedures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde and ammonia.  Arclin employees receive training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use.  Emergency response procedures are reviewed periodically and are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety;\n\nPlant safety performance and capability relative to approved procedures, standards and practices is reviewed on an ongoing basis and is a primary factor considered in design and installation of all new and improved process equipment.

No changes have been made that increases production capacity or operating temperatures or pressures that could reduce equipment reliability."
