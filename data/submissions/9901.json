The processes utilized to prevent injuries from the release will be to evacuate residences downwind of the release which could be impacted by the anhydrous ammonia vapors.

Water is also the first means of first aid for persons that come into contact with the anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn the event of a propane release one of our first steps will also include calling 911.  The fire department has the training and equipment to respond to propane releases.  Evacuation of affected residents, stopping the release, and water curtains will be the primary actions taken to mitigate the release.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe site has not had a release of propane or anhydrous ammonia within the last five years which resulted in any injury to site personnel or to the residents of Dovray.\n\nEmergency Response Program: \n\nAll of the sites emergency procedures are conducted with the local volunteer fire department.  In case of an accident at the site, the local fire department would be called upon for assistance.  The facility personnel are trained in the proper handling of the anhydrous ammonia equipment and in basic first aid procedures in case of contact with the anhydrous ammonia.

Facility personnel are responsible for transferring the anhydrous ammonia to transfer tanks which are used in conjunction with injection equipment to inject the product into the ground for use as a fertilizer.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nPropane\nThe worst case scenario for the propane stored on the site would be a tank rupture releasing all 44,352 pounds of propane and the subsequent ignition of the flammable propane resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This worst case release scenario would have an impact of approximately 0.3 miles from the tank source.  The EPA\u0012s RMP comp program was used to determine the worst case scenario impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen for the propane storage was a release for two minutes from piping coming from the tank and the subsequent ignition of the propane resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  The alternative release scenario would have an impact extending to approximately 0.1 miles from the pipe rupture.  The EPA\u0012s RMP comp program was used to determine the alternative release scenario. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nThe worst case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia stored and handled on the site would be a tank rupture releasing 84,118 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which would create a liquid spill and vaporization.  The worst case scenario would have an impact of approximately 3.3 miles from the tank source.  The EPA\u0012s RMP comp program was used to determine the worst case scenario impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen for the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling was a pipe leak for two minutes from the tank resulting in a smaller release of anhydrous ammonia and vaporization.  The alternative release scenario would have an impact extending to approximately 0.42 miles from the pipe leak.  An EPA reference table was used to determine this alternative release scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility complies with"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe facilities overall approach to safety is ensuring that the equipment used at the facility is maintained and updated as required by each process.  The facility is also committed to providing its\u0012 employees with the skills necessary to safely handle the chemicals used at the site.  Dovray Grain and feed believes that its\u0012 good relationship with its\u0012 neighbors and the surrounding agricultural community is vital to success and would not jeopardize the communities safety over profit.\n\nFor both the anhydrous ammonia and the propane storage tanks, the tanks and associated piping are visually inspected and maintained to ensure the tank and its\u0012 components are in good condition and they do not develop defects which could compromise the tanks integrity.  Both tanks contain manual shut-off valves which will stop the flow out of the piping if a rupture in any of the connected hosing should develop.  The anhydrous tank is also equipped with automatic valves which will shut off the flow if a pipe break were to occur.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is also equipped with break away piping  which will prevent damage to the tank and loss of substantial product if a transfer tank is not disconnected prior to moving away from the loading area.   The applicator tanks for the anhydrous operations are also inspected regularly and maintained to prevent releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nDovray Grain and Feed has processes present on the site for anhydrous ammonia and liquid propane which require the facility to complete a Risk Management Plan (RMP)  \n\nThe facility contains propane storage for grain drying in a 12,000 gallon tank at the eastern end of the facility.  The propane stored at the site is not available for re-sale and is utilized on the premises.  \n\nThe facility contains anhydrous ammonia for resale.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 18,000 gallon tank on the western end of the fa"
