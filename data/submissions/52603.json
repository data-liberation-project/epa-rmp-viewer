This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant, located in Stanton Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Y-Grade petroleum products from natural gas. The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including:\nY Propane\nY Normal Butane\nY Isobutane\nY Ethane\nY Methane\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at the WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of propane contained in a single vessel/storage tank. The maximum inventory in this vessel/storage tank is 180,000 pounds. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.45 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\nCheck Alternate Release\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of propane from a transfer line, 46,000 pounds released in 15 minutes. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.18 mile. This event w"

Processes at the WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \n Employee Participation\n\nThe WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way to address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and asso"

The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant currently has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Coordinator on site that assists in maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operator Procedures Manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant uses hazard and operability studies (H"

This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n The facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a Head operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify/demonstrate (e.g., via performance review, skill demonstrations and written tests) that the operator understood the training.\n \n Contractors\n \n The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions, as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. This may require that a management of change team review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\n \n An integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials, and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n \n \n Safe Work Practices\n \n The WTG Sale Ranch Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.
