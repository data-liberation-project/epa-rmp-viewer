The facility manufactures liquid Phosphate and Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid and Phosphoric Acid.  The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, oleum and a flammable gas mixture (Ammonia Process).  The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility.  The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility for the ammonia and oleum releases.  The reported worst case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint.  An ARS was reported for each substance above the regulated threshold.  The scenarios were modeled for releases that are more probable than the worst case scenario. The scenarios reported in the RMP are presented in the following paragraphs. \r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe objective of the accident prevention program is"

Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used.  PCS Nitrogen chose the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) and What if processes.  PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances.  The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product.  The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4) Emergency shutdown, 5) Emergency operation, 6) Normal shutdown, and 7) Start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.   \r\n\r\nTraining Plan\r\n\r\nPCS has developed a training plan that provides a guide for the training of each employee in job related and job specific responsibilities.

Because the relief device was not a reseating style relief device, the tank remained at atmospheric pressure until operations was able to reset the manway cover.\r\n\r\nRelease notifications were made.  Local law enforcement blocked Hwy 3115 at the intersection of Hwy 30 and blocked Hwy 30 approximately 3 miles westward.  The relief manway was reseated.  \r\n\r\n2.\tOn October 9, 2008, a leak developed in the floor of the #1 Oleum Storage Tank due to an overpressure of the tank.  The overpressure was a result of the vent line of the scrubber system being plugged, which resulted in a release from the relief device located on the top of the tank.\r\n\r\nPCS recommended a road block to protect the public along Hwy 75 during the release event.  The Louisiana State Police coordinated road blocks at the intersections of Highways 75 and 3115 as well as Highways 75 and 73 and stopped all rail traffic through the facility.  In an abundance of caution, PCS recommended a shelter in place for White Castle located across the Mississippi River in Iberville Parish until the overpressure condition was relieved.  Air monitoring was conducted.  There was no known off-site impact as a result of this incident.  \r\n\r\nThe relief valve flange was separated from the affected tank by emergency response personnel.  Once pressure was relieved, the release rate from the tank significantly decreased.  A water fog was utilized to control vapors while the contents of the affected tank were transferred to another storage tank.  The release occurred inside a containment area.  Dilute sulfuric acid caused by the water fog application was collected by vacuum trucks, temporarily held in frac tanks and used as a raw material in the phosphoric acid process.  The soil in the containment was neutralized with soda ash and flushed with water.  Runoff water was discharged through LPDES permitted internal Outfall 201 then"

The Primary objectives of EMPs are protection of life and elimination or reduction of harm to the public, employees, contractors, and the environment.  Secondary objectives are continued production and delivery of products and services.  Response and recovery actions must minimize damage done to facilities, equipment, and both delivery and communication systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThis plan ensures that compliance audits will be conducted in each operating department and service department exposed to highly hazardous and/or regulated toxic chemicals in the covered processes every three years.  The audits are directed by both a Corporate Process Safety Assessment Procedure and an Internal Process Safety Assessment Procedure. Each audit is performed by a team that is knowledgeable of the process.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAlthough PCS Nitrogen has a stringent release prevention policy, there have been two incidents within the covered processes at the facility. These are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tOn May 31, 2008 a pressure relief manway on ammonia storage tank 100K002 lifted from the tank and resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor.  Although the release lasted for approximately 4.5 hrs, the tank depressurized to atmospheric pressure during the first 2 minutes and 23 seconds.  \r\n\r\nThe release occurred as operations were cooling down an ammonia loading line with liquid ammonia in preparation for an incoming ammonia ship to offload.  Water, which remained in the line from a recent hydro test of the ammonia loading lines, was forced back into the ammonia storage tank.  The heat generated from the mixing of water and ammonia caused the ammonia in the storage tank to vaporize to an extent that the pressure increased dramatically in the ammonia storage tank.  At this point a manway relief device on the top of the ammonia storage tank lifted depress"
