In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nCone Ag, Inc. Mission states \"To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public\".  In order to fulfill this mission, Cone Ag, Inc. provides a EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures. EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the \ncompany. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary tanks [1@18,000 gallons;1@ 12,000 gallons] on site. 154,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks. In addition, anhydrous ammonia that may be stored in railcars is 160,000 pounds. Therefore, the total facility is 620,000 pound"

The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by the excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia systemis inspected on a regular basis wth maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidlines in the ANSI standards.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered.  The manager conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe location has a 'site safety coordinator' as an extention of the EHS group.

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Cone Ag, Inc. has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR  1910.38 AND 1910.1200).
