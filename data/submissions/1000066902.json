The facility is situated south-east of La Cygne Lake.  The property surrounding the La Cygne Station is rural. \r\n\r\nAmmonia System Description\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage tanks are filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  For the NOx control systems, ammonia vapors are drawn from the tanks, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flue within the ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction unit, nitrogen oxides are reacted and emissions of the pollutant are reduced.\r\n\r\nManagement System \r\n\r\nThe KCPL La Cygne RMP Program is led by an RMP Management Team dedicated to the establishment of management systems that successfully implement the various elements of the Program. KCPL La Cygne has also established written procedures to ensure that the safety of employees, the public, and the environment is maintained during plant operations and when changes are implemented.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation Program \r\nThe facility has established an employee participation program that ensures affected employees have access to complete and accurate information on the anhydrous ammonia system and that they are involved in decisions made on the system.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe facility maintains accurate and current process safety information covering the"

This analysis utilized a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  Process hazard assessments were performed using a Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) type analysis for the Unit #2 ammonia system.  This analysis utilized a review by the PHA team of a series of parameter/deviation combinations to determine possible undesirable consequences.  Both the What If and HAZOP analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  For both Units 1 and 2, checklists were completed to cover Facility Siting and Human Factors scenarios.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nWritten operating procedures are maintained that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the ammonia process. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia storage systems are in place. The operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work with or maintain the ammonia process. These procedures are reviewed at least annually to ensure they are current and accurate.  In addition, through the Management-of-Change program, the operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to confirm that they reflect current operating practice, and changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  \r\nTraining\r\nKCPL La Cygne trains, and periodically retrains through refresher training, employees involved in operating the ammonia process concerning the hazards of the process and the routine and non-routine tasks required to saf"

Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns as well as emergency procedures. \r\nContractors\r\nKCPL La Cygne has implemented a contractor safety program that includes procedures to hire and use contractors who will perform their work without compromising the safety and health of facility or contractor employees. This program helps ensure that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the KCPL La Cygne ammonia process.  This awareness should lead to reduced risks for accidents, thus improved safety for both contractor employees, KCPL employees, and the public.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe ammonia system has been designed, constructed, and installed using good engineering practices and conforms to industry standards. KCPL La Cygne's Mechanical Integrity program assures that the system is also maintained to minimize the risk of accidental ammonia release. The La Cygne Station has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.  The ammonia systems are visually inspected on a periodic basis.  \r\n\r\nHot Work Permit \r\nAn established hot work permit procedure for fire prevention is in place to ensure all necessary safety precautions are taken before any hot work is started in a non-designated hot work area.\r\nManagement of Change and Pre-startup Safety Review \r\nThe facility has developed a management of change and pre-startup safety review program to manage changes to the ammonia process. The purpose of this program is to ensure that changes to the equipment and processes are justified and have Operations, Maintenance, and Engineering Department's concurrence, with appropriate management approval. The program covers changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, structures, operational procedures, and training."

KCPL will respond to ammonia-related emergencies by notifying the Local Emergency Planning Commission and by evacuating its personnel, when needed.  After employee safety, the procedures are in place to minimize damage to equipment, minimize interruption of operations, and coordinate outside assistance. KCPL La Cygne is also included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  Ammonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an ammonia release.  A water fogging system to mitigate the impact of a release is in place. \r\n  \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe La Cygne Station has had no ammonia releases in the past five years which need to be reported in the five year accident history.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nWhile there are no specific planned changes to improve safety, normal changes to improve safety are covered under plan elements such as Process Hazard Analysis and Management of Change."
