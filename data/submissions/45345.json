      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe Carpenter Co., both Corporate and the Tupelo Division, operate the facility with attention and a serious commitment to the implimentation of safe work procedures and the protection of the environment.  The Verona, Mississippi facility utilizes an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to manage emergency response activities at the facility.  The implimentation of the ICP is directly related to the degree of training given to facility employees in regard to chemical releases and emergencies, fire evacuations, and preparation for response to the effects of natural disasters.  Carpenter Co.'s attention to Accidental Release Prevention is evidenced directly by the facility not having any reportable quantitiy (RQ) releases of Toluene Diisocyanate during the previous five reporting years.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Carpenter Co., facility is located in the Tupelo-Lee Industrial Park located approximately 1 miles south of the Tupelo in the city of Verona, Mississippi.  The Verona facility employs approximately 170 full time employees.  The facility manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in furniture, cushioning, bedding, and other applications.  The polyurethane foam manufacturing process utilizes toluene diisocyanate (TDI) [unspecified isomers], CAS# 2647-62-5, as a major reactant.  The Carpenter Co., has a total TDI storage capacity of approximately 3,250,000 pounds.  The facility maintains two railcars with approximately 190,000 pounds each of TDI , one day tank (T-15) with approximately 193,040 pounds of TDI, and two storage tanks (T-16 & T-17) with approximately 1,343,152 pounds of TDI each.  All TDI process tanks are maintained inside of the manufacturing facility with the railcars located outside.  The railcar unloading station is equipped with secondary containment diking and a sump capable of retaining the volume of one railcar. \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nCarpenter C"

      "SummaryText": "o., utilized the EPA Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) to determine the release rate and the duration fo release for the worst case scenario.  The Endpoint distance was determined using both the OCA and EPA approved modified Look-Up tables developed for the Society of Plastic Industry (SPI).  The more realistic endpoint distance (SPI method) has been reported.\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario consisted of the loss of one railcar, approximately 190,000 lbs of TDI, at 98 F, into a diked sump area of 2,123 square feet.  The use of the diked sump limits the exposure surface area of the pool to 2,123 square feet, thereby limiting the toxic endpoint distance to 85 feet (0.016miles).  The only receptor within this distance is Foamex International (another TDI user).  The endpoint distance actually stops at the property line, but we conservatively consider Foamex as a receptor.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nCarpenter Co., considered the accidental uncoupling of a TDI line from the railcar during unloading as it's alternate release scenario.  Carpenter Co., unloads railcars using sealless pumps, as opposed to using compressed air to force the material from the railcars.  The use of pumps and the configuration of the overhead piping limit the potential for release to 16.59 pounds.  The environmental parameter used to determine the endpoint distance were a three year maximum temperature of 98 F, a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, urban topography, and a stability class D.  The toxic endpoint distance for this scenario is 26 feet.  This distance is total within the Carpenter Co., property boundary and would not impact any off-site receptors.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nDuring the previous five years, Carpenter Co.'s Verona, Mississippi facility has not had any reportable quantity (RQ) releases or accident involving toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomers).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Carpenter Co., utilizes an Intergated Contingency Plan (ICP) to outline the emergency respo"

The facility works closely with the Lee County LEPC and Verona Fire Department to conduct drills and prepare for any emergency situation.  The facility maintains a HazMat repsonse team that is properly trained and equipped to aggressively respond to a hazardous chemical release.  Carpenter Co., maintains a coordination agreement with Shaw Environmental to provide remedial  services in the event of a large release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nCarpenter Co., operates with an attention to employee awareness and emphasizes ongoing training of all employees.  Any future modifications in either equipment or procedures will be incorporated into the RMP plan."
