The process is fed by liquid hydrogen chloride from the supplier's (Dow) existing pipeline. Dow operates and maintains a sub-cooler, sump and knock-out pot on the JV site for interface with the JV transfill equipment. \r\n\r\nA Milton Roy (MR) triplex pump transfers sub-cooled liquid to tube trailers and Y-cylinders. The MR pump is a positive displacement pump, therefore is fitted with a variable frequency drive (VFD) and a recycle loop, controlled by discharge pressure, tied back to the Dow subcooler sump. The purpose of the recycle loop is to maintain higher discharge pressure, particularly while filling Y-cylinders. \r\n\r\nThere are two tube trailer fill stanchions, each with a truck scale, and one dump stanchion. There is an additional truck scale on site for check weighing that is not associated with dump or fill stanchions. There are four Y-cylinder fill stanchions, each with cylinder scale, and one dump stanchion. There is an additional cylinder scale on site for check weighing that is not associated with dump or fill stanchions. \r\n\r\nTube trailers have connections at both the front (liquid) and back (gas) of the tubes. There is a single manifold to connect at the rear of the tube (gas connection), shared by the two tube trailer fill stanchions, that is used for analytical sampling and testing. The Y-cylinder fill stanchions do not have separate gas and liquid manifolds, in which case the Y-cylinder is rotated to spin the dip tube for either gas or liquid connection. \r\n\r\nIn certain cases, tube trailers and Y-cylinders will be returned on site with a small heel of liquid that must be removed before re-filling the container. This liquid heel will be dumped to Dow's anhydrous HCl header, via Dow's knock-out pot on the JV site. Several times a month, tub"

      "SummaryText": "es and cylinders will be taken out of service to have the primary vessel valve replaced. In these cases, HCl vapor that is not dumped to the anhydrous header (typically 50 psig) will be vented through an absorber on site. The absorber is essentially a liquid contactor to remove HCl vapor from a gas stream. The resulting aqueous HCl will be returned to Dow at a rate of approximately 5 gpm. The absorber will operate continuously; therefore the concentration of HCl in the aqueous return stream will vary between 0% and 38% acid. \r\n\r\nAfter connections are made to the Y-cylinder or tube trailer, high pressure Nitrogen (1000 psig) will be used to insure no leaks. This Nitrogen will be vented down to the absorber. In addition to leak check, low pressure He will be used to purge lines after making connections and before line breaking, to maintain purity and prevent operator exposure, respectively. This low pressure He, (aka cycle purge) will also be vented to the absorber.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handled at the site:\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is used in the transfer pipeline from Dow, through the triplex pumps and filling manifold into tube trailers.
