      "SummaryText": "The Fuel Processing Operators El Mirage Facility (Facility) includes transmix distillation and diesel fuel hydro-desulfurization processes.  Transmix is separated into gasoline and diesel fuel through simple distillation.  Diesel fuel separated during the distillation process is further processed using hydro-desulfurization to reduce the sulfur content to comply with Federal ultra-low sulfur diesel regulations.  The processed diesel and gasoline components are then stored and blended for wholesale distribution to commercial customers.\n\nThe process covered under this RMP includes the butane blending of gasoline including one 28,932-gallon butane storage tank.  The Facility utilizes a safe fill of no greater than 85% for the butane tank which results in a maximum storage of approximately 25,158 gallons of butane or 103,507.17 pounds, or, rounding to two significant figures as required by the EPA RMP guidance, 104,000 pounds of butane.\n\nThe Facility adheres to a Process Safety Management Program and therefore complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Accident Prevention Rule, 40 CFR 68 Subpart D -Program Level 3 for this Risk Management Plan.  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\nThe butane storage and blending process is compliant with the National Fire Protection Code 58 for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage and it is the Facility's policy to follow all future versions of the Code.  If an emergency were to occur, the Facility would coordinate with the Maricopa County Emergency Managment Department, the El Mirage Fire Department and supplemental first responders through the 911 service.  The Facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan and includes an employee training program but is not considered a responding facility.\n\nThe Worst-Case and Alternate-Case release scenarios were"
