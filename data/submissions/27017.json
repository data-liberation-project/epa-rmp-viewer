Facility Information\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.  The maximum quantity stored would be 232,000 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n     a.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint would be 5.6 miles.\n     b.  The alternative release scenario would be a release of 100 pounds and would reach a endpoint of .2 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History\n    There have been no accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan\n     The facility has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  It has also provi"
