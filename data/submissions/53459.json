This is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if an incidental release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond. Should an emergency occur, our policy is to notify the Spearman fire department and request they respond. Plant personnel are prepared to work with the fire department, LEPC and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of a release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Spearman gas plant, located near Spearman, Texas, operates processes to extract petroleum products i.e. natural gas liquids (NGL) from field natural gas. The NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including the regulated flammables ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes. The NGL product is shipped from the plant by pipeline. There are no threshold quantities of 112 ( r ) regulated toxic substances at the Spearman facility. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis newly constructed plant complies with applicable rules and regulations. In the design, construction, equipment specification  and installation applicable ANSI, ASME, ASTM, API and NFPA codes and standards were consulted.. The processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, therefore this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident preventi"

There is no routine storage of large quantities of regulated flammable substances.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Spearman gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming a team to promote both process and personal safety. The team typically have a member from operations, maintenance and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Spearman gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up to date process safety information. Reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response /exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters  (e.g. temperature, level, compositio"

The gas plant ensures that the processes are maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Spearman gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Spearman gas plant primarily uses the What If / What If Checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings "

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Spearman gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nThe Spearman plant written operating procedures are readily available in the process unit to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Spearman gas plant has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests,"

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Spearman gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Spearman gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Spearman gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Spearman gas plant has a system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Spearman gas plant will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Incident investigation reportswill be retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Spearman gas plant will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years, both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Spearman gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Spearman gas plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Spearman gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, and (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n     3.   Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature, high level)\n     4.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup pumps)  \n     5.  Atmospheric relief devices\n        \nRelease Mitigation\n\n     1.   Fire extinguishers\n     2.  Trained personnel\n     3.  Personal protective equipment \n \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Spearman gas plant is a new facility.  There have been no offsite accidents within the previous the 5 year time period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Spearman gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan which is in place to protect workers, the publics safety as well as the environment. There are no 112 ( r ) threshold toxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire department and mechanisms for notification are in place.  Employees receive the training necessary to perform their specific emergency actions.  The emergency action plan will be updated as needed and affected personnel will be informed and or trained in the change before implementation.\n\nThe Spearman gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The plant emergency plan is tailored to this facility and the emergency services available in the community.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Spearman gas plant resolved PHA findings. At the current time, no changes are planned over the foreseeabl"
