The goal of this policy is to provide safe working conditions for employees as well as protect the public and the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n      The subject source is the Tar River Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant located on Highway 97 East in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  The facility is a 21 MGD pure oxygen activated sludge treatment facility serving Rocky Mount and surrounding communities.\n       \n    The process at the wastewater treatment plant subject to the RMP regulations is the disinfection system, which manages greater than threshold quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\n\n        Based on EPA criteria, the worst-case release scenario at the Tar River Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant is the catastrophic failure of a one ton cylinder used to store chlorine or sulfur dioxide resulting in an offsite impact.  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\" was used for this determination.  This is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the Prevention program.\n\n        The worst of the alternative release scenarios considered for chlorine is the catastrophic failure of the <-inch stainless steel tubing connecting the cylinder to the pipe manifold.  In order for the reported offsite toxic end point distance of 0.2 miles to be achieved, the cylinder's internal standpipe would also have to fail. There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant designed to prevent this from occurring, however, for emergency response planning purposes they were"

The first step in the prevention program at the Plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility for the individual program elements. Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the disinfection system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring Plant employees are adequately trained and tested in the RMP program elements; ensuring new equipment and modifications to the disinfection system are designed, constructed, operated and maintained by following Management of Change, Pre-startup Review and Hot Work Permit Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and conducting periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews. \n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\n        During the previous five years, no RMP chemical injuries related to the disinfection system have occurred at the Tar River Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe emergency response program: \n\n        The Tar River Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant is included in the City of Rocky Mount's Emergency Response Plan.
