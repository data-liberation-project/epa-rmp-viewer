Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\nB. Description of the stationary source and regulated substances\nC. General accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps (Management Systems for Process Safety/Risk Management)\nD. Planned changes \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Westlake Polymers in Sulphur LA has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nA. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY\n\nThe Westlake Polymers site is located in an industrial complex in Sulphur Louisiana.  It operates 5 low-density polyethylene units using minor variants of one process.  The polyethylene product is sold to other companies who make a wide variety of finished products, from plastic film and bags, to the clear plastic shaker-caps on hot sauce bottles. The first units were built in 1965 and the last major change, a restart of an existing unit, occurred in 1993.\n\nB. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR PROCESS SAFETY/RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nB.1. SCOPE\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at the Westlake Chemical Corporation.  Because the processes at the site that are covered by the EPA RMP regulation are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.

And because our site is an OSHA Star worksite, (denoting the highest safety designation a plant can receive from OSHA), our programs are frequently reviewed by OSHA to ensure continuous improvements.\n\nB.2. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nWestlake encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each program element.  In addition, the site has onsite committees dedicated to safety that include members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nB.3. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Westlake sites keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents are available to all personnel onsite in paper form or through our computerized document management system.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A list of reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including expos"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within safe limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nB.4. PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nWestlake has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with checklists to perform these evaluations.  The combination of HAZOP and checklist analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and engineering expertise as well as knowledge of the analysis technique being used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for ad"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the findings along with the final resolution is documented and retained.\n\nB.5. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  All this information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. These procedures are regularly reviewed and certified as current and accurate.

TRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstrations) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nB.7. CONTRACTORS\n\nWestlake uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform site personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nB.8. P"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nB.9. MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nWestlake has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of the program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nB.12. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe site promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire or explosion, a toxic gas release, major property damage, an environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to site management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nB.13. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nT"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to site management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nB.14. CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at Westlake have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 RMP covered processes at the site.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure or human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the site has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (or mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n-Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n-Sophisticated computer control systems\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n-Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n-Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high pressure, high temperature, high level)\n-Curbing or diking around applicable tanks to contain liquid releases\n-Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g. uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump, etc.)\n-Flanges, gaskets, and fittings that meet or exceed design code requirements\n-Approp"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nWestlake maintains a written emergency response program which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and post incident cleanup requirements.  In addition, the site has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facilities.  Affected personnel are informed of changes and trained appropriately.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the site is coordinated with the Southwest LA Mutual Aid Association.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The site has around the clock communicatio"

This capability provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic Association meetings, the site conducts periodic emergency drills that may involve the Mutual Aid Association and emergency response organizations, and the site provides regular refresher training to our emergency responders regarding hazards of regulated substances at the site.\n\nD. PLANNED CHANGES\n\nAs an OSHA Star site, Westlake Polymers is in a mode of continuous improvement.  Changes are ongoing to ensure reliable control of the process.  Sources of enhancements to the process include audits, PHAs, incident investigation, and safety suggestions from employees and contractors."
