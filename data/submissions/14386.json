The Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of UAP Great Lakes, Burkettsville, OH are committed to the prevention of any accidential release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n-  The primary activitiy at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n-  Anhydrous ammonia ir received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields.\n-  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 12,000 and 18,000 gallon storage tanks.\n-  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tanker truck holding 35,049 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the single largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,118    pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.90 miles.\n\n b. The alternate release scenario (based on the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a nurse tank transfer hose.  Transfer hoses at the facility are 1-inch I.D. hoses approximately 12 feet in length.  The maximum quantity released in the event that a hose was to rupture during tranfer might result in the release of 2,901pounds.  The release assumes failure would only release ammonia for 2 minutes because of mitigation such as check valves.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4.

The Five-Year Accident History.\n   a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n -  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n - The facilty has:\n   a. a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38;\n   b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n   c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asess the maintenance af safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
