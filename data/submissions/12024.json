These programs enable our facility to prevent the \noccurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, \nand other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these \nprograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and \nillnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving \nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nmanufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of \nvessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be \ninvolved in a potential release shall be considered a \nsingle process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on \nthe rules, procedures, and practices which govern \nindividual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \nThese rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They \nare also communicated to and accepted by all employees at \nthe facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCESS\n\nThe Southeastern Freezer, King's Delight #4 facility is a poultry \nprocessing, freezing, and storage facility.  The facility uses ammonia\nin an industrial refrigeration system to maintain temperatures in \nthree cold storage freezers. The refrigeration system is also used"

The ammonia \nrefrigeration system is used to maintain temperatures in the \nprocessing areas.  Ammonia refrigeration is the only process subject \nto the Risk Management Legislation.  The facility contains 59,000 \npounds of the chemical in four systems.  The facility maintains a \nfull time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple \nservice inspections on a daily basis.  In addition there is a computer \ncontrol system that monitors temperatures, pressures, and the \natmosphere for leaks.  Any irregular condition will result in the \nactivation of an automated paging system to contact refrigeration \npersonnel.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 18,000 lbs. \nof ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80 % of \nthe vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a \nten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, \nammonia could travel 2.6 miles before dispersing enough to \nno longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: worst- case weather \nconditions are uncommon; industry standards for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in \nthis service; pressure safety valves limit operating \npressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in \nplace at the facility including the mechanical integrity \nprogram for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, \nand replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed \nammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and \nthe auto-dialing system in place to warn operating \npersonnel of process upsets; and the emergency response \nplan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe release of ammonia through a safety relief valve on the intercooler in the engine room #3 system would result in a release of 250 pounds of ammoni"

Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel .1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This particular scenario was chosen as \nan alternative because safety relief valves are subject designed to relieve pressure from the system if an overpressure condition exists. \nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: under normal conditions the pressure of this vessel is approximately 25 psig and the relief valve is set to relieve at 150 psig; the relief valves in the plant are replaced directly after a release or every five years as a part of the mechanical integrity program; the control system has automatic responses to high pressure conditions that will turn equipment on or off as necessary to maintain safe conditions; and \nthe emergency response plan and equipment in place at the \nfacility is constantly reviewed and updated.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been three reportable releases in the past five years.  All of the releases were handled by plant personnel and none of the releases reached any off-site receptors.\n\nThe first release occurred on August 29, 1995.  The leak was located in a freezer storage room.  Personnel responded to the event immediately and isolated the air unit tube that was the source of the problem.  As a result of the incident, approximately 90 pounds of ammonia gas was released into the freezer.  Personnel used ventilation to remove the ammonia vapor from the room.  As a result of the incident, the unit was replaced and there have been no further problems.  As a precaution, the facility destroyed 30,000 pounds of poultry which could have become contaminated.  That was less than 10% of the total amount of poultry contained in the freezer.\n\nThe second and third releases were on July 1 and 7 of 1996.  Both involved the same 3/8 inch line in blast cell n"

In both cases, the leaks were handled by personnel of Southeastern Freezer, Inc.  The leak was repaired and the remaining vapor was removed from the area using exhaust fans.  Neither of the leaks reached any off-site receptors.\n\nSince July 7, 1996 the plant has not had any substantial leaks.  The facility renovated the entire refrigeration system in 1998.  Included in this upgrade was the addition of a central control system to monitor any irregular pressures or temperatures as well as the presence of ammonia in any rooms.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the \nOSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR \n1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We \nhave trained employees for emergency response and maintain \na written emergency response plan.\n\nThis plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct \nannual drills for implementation of the emergency response \nplan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and \nthe fire department. The last update of the facility's emergency response plan  \nwas on May 7,1999.\n"
