Saftey and Health Policy Statement:\n         It is a firm and continuing policy of Field Packing Company that saftey is everyone's responsibility    and business. All with management authority, shall make the assurance of safe and healthfull working conditions and safe practices of employees a part of their daily effort and responsibility. In order ro promote a safe working enviroment, the company has established procedures for the following areas: The use of personnel protective equipment, employee training, accident investigation, saftey committee (just established), hearing conservation, emergency evacuation (engineering firm established complete plan), safe chemical handling, ammonia response, bloodborne pathogens, confined spaces, lockout\\tagout, respirators, and compliance with government regulations.\nThe management of Field Packing Co. has an obligation to produce and maintain a safe work place for each employee. In turn, each employee not only shares a degree of responsibility for his or her saftey abd the safety of fellow employee, but also contibutes to a safe working environment by using personal protective equipment, following established safety procedurec, and reporting unsafe conditions.\nThe continuing effort by all of us at Field Packing Company will contribute substantially to preserving the good health of our employees and to improving our company on a continuing basis.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention:\nField Packing Company has only recently installed our ammonia refrigeration system.  During the implementation process, only the most modern and safe equipment and processess were utilized. The refrigeration equipment is less than (3) years old with a total of seven employees monitoring the system (24) hours a day- seven days per week.\nDaily and weekly refrigeration inspections are performed by qualified trained employees. These inspections contain checks and balances to maintain the safe operation of he refrigeration system."

Latley, training has fallen behind, but employees will recive proper trainig by December 31 , 1999. Ammonia is easily detected by a very distinctive odor. Security guards and engine room personel make facility rounds and promptly report and trace amount they may encounter.\n\n3. About our Facility:\nField Packing Company distributes quality meat products in all or part of the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virgina, Ohio, Indiana, Ilinois, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Mississippi.  The Field Brand has wide recognition and acceptance in the market place that has been attained by many years of producing a consistent product line of very high quality.  Field products include sliced bacon, sliced luncheon meats, hot dogs, and bonless hams. \nAnydrous ammonia is utilized in our refigeration system.\n\n4. Worst Case Release Scenario:\nThe entire refrigeration system  contains 12,500 pounds of refrigerant while operating.\n\nField utilized the EPA guidelines for determinig off site impact; furthermore, our worst case release is unlikely to occur for the following reasons. A major rupture inone of the pressure vessels would have to occur for a release of this magnitude. The vessels were installed new in early 1997 and inspected by the State Bolier inspector's office. All vessels and piping systems were approved without additional work required. Concrete and steel barriers are present beneath the vessels that should prevent penetrations or ruptures of the magnitude needed to create such a discharge. The maximum allowable volume would have to be present in the vessel. The wind and weather conditions would have to be very similar to what was used for analysis. For worst-case analysis, the assumptionwas made that these occurenc"

      "SummaryText": "es were simulations.\n\n5 Alternate-Case Relase Scenario:\nThe circumstances for the alternate relase were chosen due to the potential of an off site impact.  It would be more likely for a leak to occur inside our facility in one of our refrigerated areas, but defensive procedures are in place to confine the area of the leak and restrict the off sight inpact.  Also, do to the location of our facility, an alternate release would dissipate before affecting the population.\n\nThe alternate release was based on a hole of one half inches in diameter occurring in a presure vessel.  This is very unlikely to occur, do to continious inspections by plant personell and pressure ratings designed in each vessel.  The other potential occurs durring transfer of ammonia from the delivery truck to Fields refrigoration system.  PB&S Chemicla Company, our anhydrous ammonia supply, inspects the tanks and hoses on the trucks every fourty five to sixty five days.  The PB&S Chemical truck drivers and employees are trained in ammonia leak response and would be in place to shut off necessary valves in order to stop the leak.\n\n6.  Accidental release provention program: \nField Packing Co. is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Managment Regulation.  Much of OSHA PSM regulation parallels 112 (R) Risck Managment Planing Requirements.  OSHA PSM Risk Managment Planning Requiremnets have been in affect for two years.\n\nDaily and weekly inspections of our system are being conducted.\n\nDaily on the job training and outside expert support is available for our ammonia refrigeration personnel.\n\nMonitoring and Employee evaluations are performed to allow employees to obtain advanced knowledge of ammonia refrigeration.  Employees achiving this level receive a pay incentive.\n\nHands on training remians a significant portion of the training received .  emergency response training has been performed, but not annually.
