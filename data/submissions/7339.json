      "SummaryText": "Dalton Utilities' Risk Management PLan for safe Chlorine Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.  The Mill Creek Water Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water taken from Mill Creek.  The chlorination process includes chlorination cylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation, electrical controls and process specific safety equipment.\nModeling was performed utilizing EPA's RMP*COMP (TM) software to identify potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine releases.  Two scenarios were modeled:  The worst case release scenario and the alternative (more likely) release scenario.  The worst case model depicted a release of 2,000 lbs. of chlorine resulting from the loss of a valve stem and yielding a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles.  The alternative scenario involved the mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection allowing the accidental release of approximately 83 lbs. of chlorine over a 10 minute period, at which time the failure was repaired.  For this scenario, the distance to toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.1 miles.  Potentially affected receptors within this radius included approximately 3 residents and an additional 125 workers at two adjacent companies.\nThe Dalton Utilities' RMP is supported by operator training, preventative maintenance, process specific safety equipment, safe and effective standard operating procedures, periodic hazard review and a continual audit and inspection program.\nThe Mill Creek plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the City of Dalton and Whitfield County Fire departments.
