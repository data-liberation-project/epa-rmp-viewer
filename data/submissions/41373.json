Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Hoffman & Reed Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, the Harrison county LEPC, and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of  fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 221,100 lbs. in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.    Worst-case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 69,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.4 miles.\nb.    The alternate release scenario: a 1.5 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow valve/valves intervenes or manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 7,000 pounds .  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.6 mile.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n    The facility is in compliance with the provisions of *Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administ"
