This \n\nprocess combines monomers along with other chemicals in a specified vessel to form the \n\nfinished adhesive product.  \n\n\n\n2.0    Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is the only chemical listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) \n\nand used above its threshold value at this site.  VAM is transported to the site primarily \n\nthrough railcars and, occasionally, tanker trucks.  Two dedicated tanks located within a \n\nsecondary containment are used to store the VAM.  This raw material is introduced into \n\nthe process through piping, pumps, and intermediate vessels prior to being metered into \n\nthe reactors where it is polymerized into the finished product.\n\n\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nChemical releases are minimized through a variety of means including operator training, \n\nequipment design and installation, initial startup, operating procedures, and maintenance \n\nprocedures.  It is the policy of the Blue Ash facility to identify the potential for chemical \n\nreleases and address their causes.  In the unlikely event a release occurs the facility \n\npersonnel are trained in operational parameters to minimize the effects without \n\ncompromising their own safety.\n\n\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\n\n\nThis facility has taken the steps identified in 40 CFR 68 to reduce or minimize the effects \n\nof any accidental release.  These processes which use VAM are also subject to the \n\nrequirements of the Process Safety Management regulations found in 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nThe following paragraphs briefly describe the current release prevention program for the \n\nprocess which polymerizes VAM.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThis information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment \n\ndesign for the associated processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "This is a systematic review of the process by a cross functional team used to ensure the \n\nhazards of the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used in \n\nthese analyses is the HAZOP technique.  The identified recommendations are reviewed, \n\nprioritized and implemented in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures are used to safely produce products in an effective and repeatable \n\nmanner.  These procedures address the  various stages of the operation including initial \n\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal \n\nshutdown, emergency shutdown, process sequencing, and startup after a shutdown.  The \n\nprocedures are periodically reviewed and are readily accessible to the operators.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMaintenance of the equipment requires a variety of methodology.  Testing and studies are \n\nperformed equipment such as vessels and piping to determine that it continues to meet its \n\ndesign capabilities; inspections are performed on devices such as rupture disks and vents \n\nto ensure they are operational; periodic maintenance is used on that equipment (pumps, \n\ncontrols, valves, etc.) which is used regularly.  Qualified personnel are used to perform \n\nthese maintenance operations.  Should a deficiency be identified during any one of these \n\nprocesses it is addressed in a timely and safe manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nChanges in the process are proposed, described, and reviewed with through written \n\nprocedures.  Changes can be a change in chemical, technology, equipment or procedure.  \n\nThose affected by the change are notified and trained, if necessary.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nPrior to a new process startup the installation, equipment, operating and maintenance \n\nprocedures are reviewed to ensure they are suitable for safe operations.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nAudits are used to identify any shortcomings in the existing program in comparison to the \n\nregulations and allow for contin"

Any corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nReportable incidents are investigated and reviewed promptly.  The purpose of the \n\ninvestigation is to record the steps leading up to the incident, identify any abnormal or \n\nunusual conditions and develop effective corrective actions to prevent similar incidents \n\nfrom occurring.  The reports are maintained for at least five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive participation of operators, maintenance mechanics, facility management and \n\ncorporate personnel is both required and encouraged.  Additional forums such as \n\nemployee involvement teams, safety meetings and business meetings are used in inform \n\nand interact with individuals.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nSome projects or tasks require additional manpower or specialized skills more efficiently \n\nprovided by contractors.  These contractors are made aware of the potential hazards \n\nrelated to the contract work and operation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n5.0  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents or releases as define in 40 CFR 68.42 over the \n\npreceding 5-year period.\n\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Emergency Plan was written to address abnormal situations such as employee \n\ninjury and chemical release.  The text includes procedures to address emergency \n\nresponse, evacuation of employees, notification of governmental agencies, and medical \n\nresponses.  It is reviewed annually and updated to reflect any pertinent changes which \n\noccasionally occur at the facility.\n\n\n\nA secondary part of the program is the installation and operation of equipment which will \n\nstop an emergency event, minimize its effects or allow evacuation from a process area.  \n\nThe equipment includes a monitored sprinkler system, fire detecting devices and fire \n\nextinguishers.  These systems are regularly inspected and serviced in order to maintain \n\ntheir reliability.\n\n"
