CR&L's SIC code is 8731 (NAICS 541712).\n\nCR&L is committed to protection of the health and safety of people in our workplace, the public and the environment.  We believe occupational illnesses, injuries and environmental incidents are preventable, and their occurrence is unacceptable.  CR&L's objective is to continuously improve health, safety and environmental (HSE) performance and be a recognized leader in industry.  \n\nCR&L's policy is to:\nA?    Operate facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations\nA?    Consider HSE implications during product development, testing, processing and storage\nA?    Devote sufficient resources to be viewed as an industry leader in the area of HSE performance\n\nRisk management (i.e. identifying and managing hazards and potentially adverse effects of activities on people, the environment, assets or reputation) is a vital part of CR&L's HSE program.  CR&L uses a HSE management system to define and manage risks at the site, and ensure operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  The management system has four basic components:\nA?    Identification\nA?    Assessment\nA?    Provision of controls\nA?    Recovery preparedness\nAssessment of risks and hazards considers the full life cycle of an activity from beginning to end.  All steps are documented.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nCR&L's hazard assessment process : \nA?    Identifies HSE hazards and potentially adverse effects, and assesses related risks which could arise from existing or proposed activities which could potentially affect the:\no    Health and safety of employees, contractors or the public\no    Environment, including soil and groundwater contamination\no    Company's reputation, liabilities or profitability\no    Company's assets\nA?
