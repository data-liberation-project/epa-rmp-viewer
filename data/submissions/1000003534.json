The facility is located at 8805 North Tabler Road.  Equistar employs approximately 300 full time employees at the plant site.  \n\n\n\n1.0         ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nEquistar is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Equistar has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Morris Plant.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant, and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Plant.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Morris Plant consists of the following four elements:\n\n\n\n-A Management system to oversee implementation of the RMP elements.\n\n-A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n-A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n-An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nAlthough this risk management program at the Morris Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Plant.  In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  To effectively implement these policies, Equistar has established a management system headed by the Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities.\n\n\n\n1.1         Policy on the use of hazardous substances:\n\n\n\nBefore using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, Equistar considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect the plant workers, the public and the environment through the management of change and the process hazard analysis processes and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2         Preventing accidental releases of the hazardous substances:\n\n\n\nEquistar is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Equistar implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, installation and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, Equistar requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with re"

Equistar's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.  The Morris Plant also participates in auditing processes to measure and enhance its prevention program.\n\n\n\n1.3         Minimizing impact from an accidental release:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Morris Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  Equistar provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts with area industry and the local emergency response agencies.  Equistar trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Equistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Response activities have been discussed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Northeast Illinois Area Mutual Aid Association.\n\n\n\n1.4         Community Participation:\n\n\n\nThe Morris Plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since November, 1992.  The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets bimonthly and addresses topics of interests to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\n\n\n2.0         ST"

The stationary source consists of an ethylene, polyethylene process areas and support facilities.  The following facilities (processes) are covered by this Rule:  Olefins unit, Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) unit, Linear Low Density (LLDPE) unit.  The Morris Plants key products are ethylene, propylene, low-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene with by-products of hydrogen, crude butadiene and aromatic gasoline.  The feedstocks used are ethane and propane.  Feedstocks arrive at the facility by pipeline and railcar.  \n\n\n\n3.0         WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Morris Plant handles several regulated toxic and flammable substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  The Morris Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" (WCS) and an \"alternative release scenario\" (ARS) for each toxic and one to represent all flammables.  In reality, Equistar does not expect a worst-case scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nEPA Look-Up Tables were used for evaluating the worst and alternate case release scenarios for flammable and toxic materials.  The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within this distance from the location of the covered processes.  United States Geological survey (USGS) maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.
