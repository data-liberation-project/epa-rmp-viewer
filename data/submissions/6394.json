The Fort Wayne Distribution Center has two ammonia refrigeration plants in two separate buildings; one system consisting of 21,000 lbs. controls temperatures in the freezer.  The second system is a 15,000 lb. capacity controlling the temperatures in the perishable building.\n\nThe freezer has frozen product, i.e., meat, ice cream, vegetables, breads, cakes, pre-packaged meals and anything else that can typically be found in the frozen department of any grocery store.  The perishable building products are those items that need temperature control but should not be frozen.  These items might be bananas, tomatoes, packaged meats, potatoes, onions, dairy products and poultry.\n\nPSM and RMP, as well as many safety policies within our facility, enable us to prevent the occurrence, minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia, as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Additionally, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical that is over the threshold quantity.  Other hazardous materials are in-house, but in quantities below their threshold level.  Regardless, accepted industry safety practices, such as MSD Sheets, proper storage, personal protective equipment, etc., are used religiously.  These products are typical of what one would find in a maintenance shop servicing a building or related fork truck type equipme"

      "SummaryText": "nt.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system consists of compressors, vessels, condensers, evaporators and pumps and are interconnected into one system.  This applies to both buildings.  Both buildings are in close proximity and therefore, wind direction, other atmospheric conditions and downwind receptors would be identical.\n\nWe believe our safety programs prevent accidents due to our focus on rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, work performed, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and updated as necessary.  Employees are included in all \"Management of Change\" or rule changes."
