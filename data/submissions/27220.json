Detection system activates visual alarms at the facility main control center to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak in the chiller system.\n* Ammonia detection is hard wired to chiller building ventilation system. Detection system will activate exhaust fans in the event of a detected ammonia release.\n* Refrigeration Control System monitors and controls compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps. System displays continual operational status of equipment and controls alarms / shutdowns for out of  parameter indications. \n* High level alarms and system shut offs are installed on pressure vessels. Abnormal operating levels sensed in the vessels will activate a shutdown of the compressors.\n* Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels to eliminate the potential for an over-pressure condition within the vessel and the refrigeration system. \nAmmonia detection sensor installed on safety relief valve vent stack will activate water deluge system to \"scrub\" ammonia vapor prior to release into the atmosphere in the event of a release.\n* Emergency \"stop\" button installed outside chiller building and in facility main control room to stop all ammonia refrigeration equipment and start exhaust fans in the event of a release.\n* Computerized \"MAXIMO\" preventative maintenance program is instituted within the maintenance department to ensure all refrigeration components are maintained in optimum operational and mechancal condition.\n* Continual vibration analysis of ammonia compressors is installed to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure.\n* Rumford personel on-site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Personel monitor system performance and make scheduled rounds to detect potential hazards or abnormal operation of the system.",

It is our goal to achieve and sustain \" Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Rumford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nRumford Power is a combined cycle cogeneration power plant. The regulated substances handled here are: Anhydrous Ammonia used as a refrigerant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency. Aqueous Ammonia is used as a catalyst to control nitrogen oxides (NOx). Approximately 55,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the \"Chiller System\" and 93,000 pounds of Aqueous Ammonia is used in the injection system and is stored in an above ground storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver in the Chiller System. This facility is located in a rural area and there may be off-site consequences in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Rumford Power are to comply with EPA's accidental prevention rule, OSHA's process safety management rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Each system and equipment at Rumford Power is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the afformentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\nRumford Power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use.\n\nThe emergency response program at Rumford Power is to contact the Rumford Fire Department. It is our policy to request the fire department's response to an emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familiar with our systems and materials.\n\nCurrently there are no plans to revise existing safety programs being administered at Rumford Power."
