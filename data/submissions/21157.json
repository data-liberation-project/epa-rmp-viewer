Facility Policy: the owners, management and employees of Sheffield Farmers Cooperative, (The facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the Facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. It is stored at the facility in one (1) 30,000 gallon, steel container. the maximum quantity stored would be  127,500 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:\n\nA. The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largesst storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  the maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as a limited by design standards. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles\n\nB. The Alternate Case Scenario, based on  the 5 year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), would be a relase from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes until an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,600 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersionto 200 ppm) is a 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: the Facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1\", published by the American "

      "SummaryText": "National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference in Iowa ADministrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form, Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or signigicant property damage at the Facility; nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Program: The Facility has a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHa Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and has provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the Facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
