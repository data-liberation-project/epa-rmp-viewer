WITH THE ADDITION OF 40 NURSE TANKS WITH A CAPACITY OF 176,000 POUNDS MAKES THE COMPANY?S TOTAL CAPACITY OF 255,000 POUNDS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO MAY POTENTIALLY RELEASE 79,000 POUNDS (OVER A TEN MINUTE PERIOD) AND HAS A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.89 MILES.  THIS RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 60  AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A RELEASE OF 11,908 POUNDS OVER A 2?MINUTE RELEASE PERIOD.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES AND WOULD STILL AFFECT 30  PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUESTS FOR IMPROVEMENT.  THOSE CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE ACTED UPON IMMEDIATELY TO REDUCE POTENTIAL AMMONIA RELEASES.  OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY PROCEDURES, PROPER PLANT OPERATION, PLANT MAINTENANCE AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE COMPETENCY TESTED OVER THE TRAINING MATERIAL.  EACH EMPLOYEE USES GOGGLES AND GLOVES DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS AS WELL AS ALWAYS PROVIDING PLENTY OF SAFETY WATER DURING NURSE TANK LOADING OPERATIONS. \n\nWITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRAINING IN MIND, IT MAKES IT VERY SIMPLE TO REPORT TO YOU THAT ABSOLUTELY NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS FACILITY FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE THE RISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUND"
