The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Lewistown Propane & Fertilizer Co. are committed to safety and prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of any accidental releases, we work with local DES as well as fire departments and law enforcement agencies.  We fund local training exercises on a yearly basis.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity of the Moccasin branch site is the receiving, storing and delivering of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     In Moccasin, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored at Moccasin would be 116,000 pounds in an 30,000 gallon tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario.\n\n     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank released over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 116,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\n\n     a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n          -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n          -  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,\n             property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n          -  The facility has:\n\n              a.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and communtiy righ"

There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
