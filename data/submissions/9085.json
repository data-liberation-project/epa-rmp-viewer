This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the City of Xenia Fire Division which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chlorine Storage and Distribution.  We only have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  The regulated substance at our facility is used exclusively in the Chlorination of Wastewater entering the Facility.  Chlorine is used only during the Chlorination Season (April through October) for the chlorination of the Wastewater influent.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 2,000 Lbs. stored in one 2000 Lb. cylinder.  Administrative controls manage the Chlorine inventory at a maximum of 2,000 Lbs. of chlorine (one cylinder) at any one time in the cylinder room.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative-Case Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been determined for the Facility using the EPA RMP Comp program downloaded from EPA's Web-Site.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Guidance for Chlorine Storage Facilities.  \n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Spec"

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nOur emergency response plan has been coordinated and verified with The City of Xenia's Fire Division and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Below are some of the major steps we will be considering to improve safety at our facility over the coming year.  \n\nA.  Install High Pressure or Temperature Alarms on the Chlorine Cylinder Manifold.\nB.  Reviewing alternate methods of sanitizing the Water Supply.\nC.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with The Chlorine Institute Standards.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the Chlorine process.\n\nHazard Review:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these reviews is the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability study) Methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at regular intervals of every four to five years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant has written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a maintenance activity.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nThe City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; Chlorine storage cylinders, equipment,  piping and valve  systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and fittings.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at The City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nThe City of Xenia's Ford Road Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
