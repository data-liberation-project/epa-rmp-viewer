              "Description": "Process Hazards Analyses (PHA's) have been done on various parts of the Lannate(R) - API Process for over 20 years.       Safety Information is reviewed and revised continuously depending on such factors as PHA cycle, material hazards, safe limits, MSDS's, P&ID's etc.  To spread the PHA workload over time, the Lannate(R) - API Process has been divided into \"subsections\" with the separate PHA's in each of the \"subsections\" being updated on off-set 5-year cycles.   All of the PHA techniques shown below could have been used for the PHA for a particular section in the Lannate(R) - API Process.  The dates shown reflect the most recent subsection that was reviewed.  All of the changes recommended in that same \"subsection\" PHA were or will be completed as of the date shown.  Only the hazards identified in that same \"subsection\" PHA are marked \"yes\".  Other hazards could have been identified in other \"subsection\" PHA's.     Operating procedures are broken down into subsections with review/upgrading/revising done on a 5-year cycle.  Additional revisions may occur prior to the formal review cycle as upgrades are identified.  Training for operators is specifically designed for a given operator title.       Employees involved in maintenance activities obtain general skills training at Lee College and area specific training in the area.  Area maintenance procedures are for those maintenance jobs that have some degree of uniqueness to the area.  All equipment inspections are not done at the same time.  Much of the equipment, including the major vessels and relief devices, get inspected annually.       To insure compliance, a 5-year audit cycle is used.  The various components of OSHA 1910.119 are audited by a set schedule with roughly 1 component audited every 3 months.  The unit investigates all incidents whether involving personal safety and/or PSM implications.",

              "Description": "Process Hazards Analyses (PHA's) have been done on various parts of the Herbicides Process for over 20 years.        Safety Information is reviewed and revised  continuously depending on such factors as PHA cycle, material hazards, safe limits, MSDS's, P&ID's etc.  To spread the PHA workload over time, the Herbicides Process has been divided into \"subsections\" with the separate PHA's in each of the \"subsections\" being updated on off-set 5-year cycles.  The date shown below is for the most recent of these \"subsection\" PHA's.   Any of the PHA techniques shown in Section 7.4b below could have been used for a PHA in the Herbicides Process, but the \"What If\" technique indicated for the most recent review.  All of the changes recommended in that same \"subsection\" PHA were or will be completed as of the date shown.  Only the hazards identified in that same \"subsection\" PHA are marked \"yes\".  Other hazards could have been identified in other \"subsection\" PHA's.  Operating procedures are broken down into subsections with review/upgrading/revising done on a 3-year cycle.  Additional revisions may occur prior to the 3-year formal review cycle as upgrades are identified.  Training programs are reviewed and revised upon each use for a new trainee.  Training for operators is specifically designed for a given operator title.  Employees involved in maintenance activities obtain general skills training at Lee College and area specific skills training in the area.  Area maintenance procedures are for those maintenance jobs that have some degree of uniqueness to the area.  There are only 3 area specific maintenance procedures for Velpar(R).   All equipment inspections are not done at once.  Much, but not all of the equipment, including major vessels and relief devices, is inspected annually.  The date shown in section is the last major shutdown at which time most of the inspections were done. To insure compliance, a 3-year audit cycle, as required by OSHA 1910.119 is used.  The various components of OSHA 1910.119 (PHA, Operating procedures, etc) are audited by a set schedule with roughly 1 component audited every 3 months.  The unit investigates all incidents whether involving personal safety and/or PSM implications.  There have been no high potential incidents involving DMA over the past five years.",

              "Description": "Process Hazards Analyses (PHA's) have been done on various parts of the Vinyls Process for over 20 years.  Safety Information is reviewed and revised continuously depending on such factors as PHA cycle, material hazards, safe limits, MSDS's, P&ID's etc.  To spread the PHA workload over time, the Vinyls Process has been divided into \"subsections\" with the separate PHA's in each of the \"subsections\" being updated on off-set 5-year cycles.  Any of the PHA techniques shown could have been used for a PHA in the Vinyls Process, but the What If/Checklist technique was used for the PHA completed on the date shown.  Operating procedures are divided into subsections with review/upgrading/revising done on a 3-year cycle.  Additional revisions may occur prior to the 3-year formal review cycle as upgrades are identified.  Training programs are reviewed and revised upon each use for a new trainee.  Training for operators is specifically designed for a given operator title.  A formal audit of the entire training program is conducted on a three year frequency.  Numerous individual training packages have been reviewed on a routine basis since the last complete audit.  Employees involved in maintenance activities obtain general skills at Lee College and area specific skills training in the area.  Area maintenance procedures are for those maintenance jobs that have some degree of uniqueness to the area.  All equipment inspections are not done at once.   Much of the equipment, including major vessels and relief devices, is inspected annually and others on a 2-5 year frequency.  To insure compliance, a 3-year audit cycle, as required by OSHA 1910.119 is used.  The various components of OSHA 1910.119 (PHA, Operating procedures, etc.) are audited by a set schedule with roughly 1 component audited every 3 months.",

This belief covers on and off-job injuries, occupational illnesses and accidental releases.  DuPont is also committed to keeping its facilities ready to respond to any incident that occurs in spite of our best prevention efforts.\n\nDuPont established PSM on a Corporate basis in 1979.  General definitions, policies and organizational structure that implement PSM are given in Section S21A of the DuPont Safety and Occupational Health Guidelines.  PSM goals, policies and procedures are embodied in numerous corporate manuals and documents such as Engineering Standards, Safety Manuals and Guidelines.\n\nDuPont's LaPorte Plant endorses, adheres to and carries out Corporate PSM policies, procedures and guidelines.  The DuPont LaPorte Plant's Accidental Release Prevention policies come within the scope of the site's existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We apply PSM to all processes and chemicals at this site, not just those covered by the RMP Regulation.\n\nThe stated purpose of the LaPorte Plant's PSM Program is to manage and control the hazards in our processes, to protect individuals, plant equipment, our business integrity, and our community through the elimination of hazards.  PSM involves the application of controls to our processes through operating & maintenance procedures and practices, training, management of change, equipment inspection, and auditing.\n\nThe Principles that govern the DuPont LaPorte Plant's PSM actions are:\n  --All injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable.  We will work in a proactive,\n     preventive m"
