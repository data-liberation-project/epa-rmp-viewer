The business has operated from this location for more than thirty years as a responsible contributor to the community.\n\nThe company is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors dedicated to the code of management practice of the Responsible Distribution Process. The safe management of chemical products is considered priority to minimize the risk to our community, environment and personnel. The operating systems, programs and procedures are audited by a third party for compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nAdditionally, Industrial Chemicals Inc. manages the facility in compliance with all Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and local regulations.\n\nTo ensure the facility continues to operate in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with all regulations, an extensive risk management system has been developed and integrated into our operating programs.\n\nSignificant components of the system include training, operating procedures for chemical handling, inspection, maintenance, emergency response and incident management. These procedures provided to responsible personnel and management's continual compliance oversight ensures safe chemical management.\n\nThe Operations, Safety and Compliance Department and Warehouse Manager are designated as having the primary responsibility and accountability to ensure the plan and all components are in compliance and implemented.\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is designed for recei"

There are no manufacturing activities conducted at the site.\n\nBoth liquid and dry chemicals are received in bulk and small packages and placed in storage for shipment in smaller quantities to industrial customers. These include portable tanks, cylinders and drums. Some of the chemicals described are purchased and received from the manufacturer in small size containers and others are received in tankers and transferred to storage tanks or drums.\n\nAmmonium Hydroxide 30% (Aqua Ammonia)\n\nThe liquid arrives at the facility by bulk transport tanker. The chemical is transferred directly to drums and portable tanks then placed in storage.\n\nSmaller packages include 55 and 15 gallon drums and 350 gallon portable tanks. These containers are stored in areas designed to prevent the spread of liquid should a container failure occur.\n\nPackaging is restricted to areas constructed of concrete with curbing to prevent the spread of liquid to other areas. Collection equipment is immediately available to capture liquid released during the packaging process and return it to storage.\n\nOnly authorized and trained personnel are permitted to package and handle the containers.\n\nChlorine\n\nThis gas is packaged in steel cylinders. The product is delivered to the facility on trailers specifically designed to transport these containers.\n\nThe chemical is liquefied under pressure and release from the container is in the form of a gas. The cylinders are equipped with safety mechanisms to minimize the possibility of an accidental release and pressure relief devices are installed should the container be exposed to excessive heat from elevated temperature conditions such as that associated with a fire.\n\nChlorine is shipped off site in small quantities to water treatment facilities using the gas to treat potable water for public consumption.\n\nThe containers are stored in secured racks to prevent accidental damage and away from equipment traffi"

The containers are stored in a room within the warehouse building. Both are constructed of concrete floors with concrete curbing around the perimeter and a ramp at the entrance to prevent the spread of liquid to other areas of the building.\n\nThe drums are palletized and single stacked in an area with limited access away from traffic. Each container is inspected daily to verify package integrity.\n\nOnly authorized and trained personnel are permitted to handle the containers.\n\nFormaldehyde 37% Solution\n\nThe liquid arrives at the facility by bulk transport tanker. The chemical is transferred directly to drums and portable tanks then placed in storage.\n\nThe packaging area is designed to limit the amount of material packaged at one time. The area is constructed of concrete with curbing to prevent the spread of liquid within a larger area of the same type construction.\n\nThe storage area for the chemical is located inside a building constructed of concrete floors and wall. The designated area for storage is situated away from equipment traffic to minimize the possibility of accidental container damage.\n\nOnly authorized and trained personnel are permitted to package and handle the containers.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\n\nThis material is packaged in steel cylinders. The product is delivered to the facility on trailers specifically designed to transport the containers.\n\nThe chemical is liquefied under pressure and release from the container is in the form of a gas. The cylinders are equipped with safety mechanisms to minimize the possibility of an accidental release and pressure relief devices are installed should the container be exposed to excessive heat from elevated temperature conditions such as that associated with a fire.\n\nS"

Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period and knowledge is determined by verbal and written test. Management follows a yearly schedule issuing course work on a weekly basis to the facility manager. Classes are held at the facility on a weekly basis for one to two hours. Attendance is mandatory for all employees including drivers and warehouse personnel and is verified by the Compliance Department.\n\nNew employees are required to receive an extensive orientation to the operating procedures for each phase of the operation including material handling equipment, transportation vehicle loading and unloading, transportation equipment operations, liquid material transfers, personal protection, hazard recognition and safe work practices.\n\nEmployees not having worked in a process receive an introduction by thorough procedural documentation review and pairing the employee with a person familiar with the process for an unspecified period. Management within the guidelines of the program verifies competency of safe operating practices.\n\nThe company provides training according to the following regulatory and association requirements:\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n\nHazardous Waste"
