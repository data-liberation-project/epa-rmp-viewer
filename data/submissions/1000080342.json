      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nNunes Cooling is located approximately 0.2 mile southwest of 101 Freeway in Salinas, CA. The facility stores, cools and ships harvested agricultural products and employs approximately 50 persons at this location. Nunes Cooling has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  Nunes Cooling's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility utilizes ammonia refrigeration for their Cold Room and Vacuum Cooling System. The systems are defined as closed loop systems.  Approximately 14,000 and 26,000 lbs of ammonia are contained in the Cold Room and Vacuum Tube Systems respectively.  The system runs approximately three-quarters of the year. During the off season, ammonia is transferred into nurse tank vessels and stored until the next harvest season when it is transferred back into the refrigeration equipment.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nPer the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for each Ammonia Refrigeration System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nPer the EPA Regulations, five alternative-case release scenarios have been considered.  The one scenario with the largest potential release was selected for release modeling.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nSince the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Nunes Cooling has structured its safety programs to make the worst-"

      "SummaryText": "case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n-    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n-    The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n-    The Cold Room System relief valves pipe to a Water Diffusion Tank and a majority of the Vacuum Tube System relief valves also pipe to a diffusion tank.\n\n-    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\n\nThe history of Nunes Cooling has had no RMP-applicable ammonia releases in the last five years.  This reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the facility staff in safely operating the refrigeration systems.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Nunes Cooling to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n-    68.65 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\n-    68.67 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n-    68.69  Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n-    68.71 Training (TRN)\n\n-    68.73 Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n-    68.75 Management of Change (MOC)\n\n-    68.77 Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\n-    68.79 Compliance Audits (CA)\n\n-    68."

Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNunes Cooling has written Emergency Action Plan.  Nunes Cooling does not have an Emergency Response plan, because they are not a first responder in the event of an ammonia release.  The Emergency Action Plan includes the following\n\n-    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n\n-    Evacuation Procedures\n\n-    Safety and Health Considerations\n\n-    Notification Procedures\n\n PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNunes Cooling is extremely diligent in the handling of ammonia. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the PHA Report.  Several recommendations were generated in the 2019 PHA.\n\n"
