(formerly Lonza, Inc.) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as to protect the environment.  A brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented include:\n\n(1)  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n(2)  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical  releases\n(3)  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n(4)  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n(5)  An overview of our emergency response program\n(6)  An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n1.0   STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nGulf Bayport Chemicals, L.P. produces organic chemicals (Specialty Anhydrides) as intermediates for our customers to make epoxies, hardeners, resins, and food-grade applications (Starch modifiers).  The regulated substances listed in EPA's RMP rule in our facility are  Isoprene and 1,3-Pentadiene (Piperylene).  They are both flammable substances. The facility does not handle any listed toxic substances.\n\n\n2.0   RELEASE SCENARIOS AND OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSES\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information concerning the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n2.1  Worst-case Release  Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Substance\n\nNA\n\n2.2  Worst-case Release  Scenarios - Regulated Flammable Substance\n\nTwo worst-c"

This is the largest storage tank of Isoprene, and the release will be contained in a concrete containment area.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Assuming the released Isoprene has a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated affected endpoint is 0.1 miles according to the EPA's RMP Comp Modeling Program.  The potential public receptors include employees of the Quality Carriers plant.  Isoprene is used to produce specialty anhydrides.\n\nThe other scenario is the rupture of the 1,3-Pentadiene (Piperylene) storage tank with a maximum storage capacity of 117,000 pounds in the Tank Farm.  This is the largest storage tank of 1,3-Pentadiene, and the release will be contained in a concrete containment area.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equipment.
