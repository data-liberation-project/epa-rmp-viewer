      "SummaryText": "Ferrara Candy Company manufactures cookies at our facility in Florence, KY.   We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nFerrara Candy Company takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Engineering & Facilities Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Florence plant produces cookies for sale to the public.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Florence plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employee Participation Program \n\n- Process Safety Information \n\n- Pro"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the Florence plant over the past five years that resulted in significant of-site or offsite consequences. \n\n\n\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the Florence Plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures and procedures to contact off-site emergency response personnel. The program has been coordinated with the Florence Fire Department and Northern Kentucky LEPC.\n\n\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFerrara Candy Company is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective.  There are current plans to install an additional ammonia detector at the facility."
