This guideline was developed in order to familiarize wastewater chlorination pretreatment facility personnel with the hazards associated with Cl2 and to provide a structured response to mitigate any such incident.  Further, to work with local emergency personnel and response teams to cordon off the areas surrounding the plant to prevent danger to the public.  This guideline will also develop proper procedures for initial evacuation of endangered site and mill personnel and local citizens in and around the area.  The plan addresses Level I (minor) incidents as well as Level II incidents.  Included is plant personnel responsibilities and courses of action.  It also shows emergency response personnel responsibilities and instructions to follow EPA, the State of North Carolina Incident Command Guidelines and the Standard Operating Procedures of the local authority.  It references the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.
