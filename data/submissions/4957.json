The vessel is also inspected daily by a plant facility mechanic, trained in the operation of the system.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the High pressure receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these receivers;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessels are relatively new;\n\n* Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these receivers;\n\n* The facility has a preventive main"

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  Because the highpressure receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation1 was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation2 was considered, because the facility believes that emergency responders cold identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.  However, this does not change the TEP distance obtained from the model plan.  \n\nUsing the specified meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for the more likely release scenario was estimated to be 450 feet or 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n\n* The facility has a"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes Lipton employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) in 1997, using the What-if... technique.

The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors.\n\nThe high side compressor suction draws from the intercooler (booster discharge) and the high side suction accumulator at bout 25 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from an ice builder, air handlers, and various cooler units.  Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and return to the system.\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to five condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for operation of the pumper drums.\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air handlers.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the properly line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a"

This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the Model Plan), dated May 1996.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n2.1\tWORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the high pressure receiver (approximately 9,700 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 6,200 feet of 1.2 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the highpressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs every three years by a Factory Mutual inspector who has been certified by the National Board.

Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the processing and storage temperature for margarine and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 18,500  pounds (i.e., 3,500 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that perates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 9,700 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only about 2,700 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.\n\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The margarine processing units (MPUs) operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly freeze product on scrape surface heat exchangers.  Ammonia suction from the MPUs at about 0 psig passes through the low side accumulator before entering the booster compressors.  Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low sid"

The PHA resulted in 50 procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the refrigeration system.  These recommendations are in the process of being resolved and many changes have already been implemented.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared during 1998 to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.\n\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.

The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\nThe ERP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LERC), and evacuation of the facility and surrounding area.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n1\tPassive mitigation means equipment, devices, and technologies that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input.  Examples include enclosures (e.g., buildings) for compressed gases and secondary containment dikes for liquids.\n2\tActive mitigation means equipment, devices, or technologies that require human, mechanical, or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation for compressed gases, like ammonia, may include automatic shut-off valves, rapid transfer systems, and scrubbers.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\t11\tRMP FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\t\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND DATA ELEMENTS"
