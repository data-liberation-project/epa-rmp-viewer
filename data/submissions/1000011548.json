Helena receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar and the railcar is temporarily parked on the facilities rail spur in anticipation of the anhydrous ammonia being reacted by an Independent Fertilizer Contractor (See Fertilizer Reacting Process). It is anticipated that a single 34,000-gallon railcar would be delivered, although two (2) 34,000-gallon railcars could be delivered.  The Fertilizer Manager implements the Risk Management Program while the railcar(s) is parked on the spur, at break times during the reacting process, and when the reaction process is complete and residual anhydrous ammonia may remain in the railcar.  The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program/PSM that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor requirements.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Aransas Pass Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Aransas Pass Facility located at 1611 North Commercial, Aransas Pass, TX 78336.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Aransas Pass Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Aransas Pass Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP to change the Program Level from Program 2 to Program 3 and to include two different covered processes; a temporary ammonia storage process and a temporary fertilizer reacting process that were previously considered as a single process.  Helena is resubmitting this RMP as a 5-Year update.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and the alternative case release scenarios.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Aransas Pass Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility, but it no longer sales anhydrous ammonia directly to customers as part of its retail operations.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via railcar or possibly commercial truck.   Anhydrous ammonia is stored in the transportation container until it is reacted with phosphoric acid in a mobile pipe reactor and then diluted with water.  Helena does not own or operate the reacting process.  The reacting process and ancillary railcar unloading procedures are performed by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  After the reacting process is complete, any residual anhydrous "

      "SummaryText": "ammonia is stored in the transportation containers until the transportation company removes the container from the Helena Facility.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage process and the reacting process.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the ammonia storage and the reacting process.  The worst case scenario release for the Aransas Pass Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a single railcar) are released.  The release was modeled as if the railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are different for the two processes.  The ammonia storage alternative consequence analysis assumed that a vapor valve is leaking or is not fully closed.  (The scenario actually assumes the valve is only 50% closed.)  The reacting process alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer line is severed during the reacting process.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Helena employees.  Helena employees inspect the markings on transportation containers to ensure that the containers are operated within the U.S. DOT required inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the railcars are not overfilled.  Helena employees also inspect the railcars for leaking valves and fittings and they conduct daily inspections of the railcar storage area for audio, visual, or olfactory indications of leaks.\n\nThe reacting process prevention program is implemented by the IFRC because Helena does not own or operate the reacting process.  Helena requires"

      "SummaryText": " the IFRC to certify its compliance with a Process Safety Management Plan and it spot checks some aspects of the contractorA?s PSM documentation (e.g. maintenance, training records) to ensure that the Contractor is complying with its PSM Plan.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelenaA?s Aransas Pass Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.  Helena has a written Contingency Plan that includes procedures to notify local emergency response agencies in event of a significant ammonia release.  Helena employees will not, under any circumstance, serve as first responders to a significant release of ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Aransas Pass Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Aransas Pass Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Aransas Pass Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Aransas Pass County LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPAA?s RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Aransas Pass Facility.\n"
