Contractors are required to perform all work in accordance with TVG policy and Cal-OSHA Process Safety Regulation regulations.  Contractors are required to complete a Qualification Questionnaire prior to performing work at TVG.\n* Lock out/tag out and Hot Work policies and procedures.\n* Accident Investigation procedures and documentation.\n1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nPlant 1 processes and cans various types of fruit (peaches, pears, pineapple, grapes, and cherries).

The quantities of ammonia associated with this ARS are not expected to extend beyond the property boundaries given the ARS meteorological conditions recommended in the USEPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The \"What-If\" analyses were last reviewed in 1999.\n1.4    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPlant 1 is in compliance with the OSHA PSM and RMP rules.  Specific steps that are key to the TVG prevention program include:\n* Developing and maintaining written Process Safety Information identifying workplace chemical and process hazards, equipment used in the process, and technology used in the processes.\n* Developing and maintaining Process Hazard Analysis used to identify potential failure scenarios and conditions of the process and facility that could result in the release of ammonia.\n* Developing and maintaining Operating Procedures that are specifically designed to address the handling and maintenance of materials and equipment associated with direct or indirect use of ammonia.\n* Providing and maintaining Training Programs that are specifically designed to address all operational, maintenance, and emergency aspects of processes associated with the ammonia systems.\n* Developing and maintaining a Pre-Start Up Safety Review of equipment and process associated with the ammonia systems.\n* Developing and maintaining a program that ensures the Mechanical Integrity of equipment associated with the ammonia systems.\n* Developing and maintaining a Hot Work Permit system to address any hot work that may directly or indirectly affect the ammonia systems.\n* Establishing and maintaining a Management of Change program to address any equipment"
