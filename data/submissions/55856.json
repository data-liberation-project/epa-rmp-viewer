The City will take every reasonable action to prevent all accidental releases. We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting processes available.\n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).  The City will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment. Onsite employees are trained to evacuate the site and call the Fire Department if a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak is detected.  The Fire Department visits the site each year to remain familiar with the chemical system and it\u00bfs risks.  \n\nThe Stationary Sources.  The stationary sources are the chlorine disinfection system and the sulfur dioxide de-chlorination system at this municipal wastewater treatment plant. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the regulated substances handled at this facility. The chlorine system has a maximum inventory of 14,000 pounds, and the sulfur dioxide system has a maximum inventory of 3,000 pounds. These quantities qualify both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems as Program 3 processes.\n\nThe Worse-Case Scenario.  The worst case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine tank. The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be released. In the worst-case scenario, this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents into the chlorine room in ten minutes. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a leaking pipe connected to a ton cylinder. Based on a 1/16 inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 100 pounds of chlorine during a ten-minute release.

The chemical systems were designed according to current codes and specifications at the time of installation, and adhere to good operating practice. The operators and contractors who work in and around the chemical equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures. We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the chemical equipment.\n\nFive Year Accident History.  There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  The Wastewater Treatment Plant has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. Employees are trained to evacuate the facility and call the Fire Department when a chemical leak is detected.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from offsite responding agencies. The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.  The ERP was last reviewed on June 25, 2009. ERP training for all employees was last conducted on June 25, 2009. The ERP is coordinated with the Buena Vista Fire Department. The contact is the Battalion Chief, at telephone (540) 261-2390. The facility is also subject to OSHA 1910.38."
