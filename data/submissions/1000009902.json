FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nThere have been no recordable accidents in the last 5 years. \n\n\n5. THE EMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM.\n\nIn the event of a catastrophic release (more than 100 pounds of ammonia), the plant will  evacuate.  Emergency Response Team members under supervision from the Emergency Response Coordinator using the proper personal protective equipment may use fans or other defensive devices to protect employees while they evacuate.  \nTrained Kodiak Hazmat Responders arriving onscene along with trained Trident Hazmat technicians will initiate offensive tactics and manage emergency situations.  \n\nA written Emergency Action Plan has been developed and is on record at the facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances, and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedure, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\nAll Hazmat courses at Trident Seafoods Corp are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR1910.120 (q) (7) and (8).\n\nAll Kodiak, AK Hazmat Team Members are trained 24 hours initially to the Technician level followed by 8-24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site Hazmat Instructor at the facility.  Each instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level.\n\nThe training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of the hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the"
