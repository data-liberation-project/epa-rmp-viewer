These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment operating, and maintenance procedure are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rules and regulations are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nIncident investigations are conducted for any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of the regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident (root case analysis) as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Incident investigations start promptly and no later than 48 hours after the event.

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees operating or maintaining the chlorination process are trained.  Training ensures employees have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including emergency response, as provided in the written operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to employees working with or operating the chlorination system and equipment.  This helps to ensure that the employees understand and adhere to the current operating procedures.\n\nMaintenance\n\nWritten maintenance procedures have been assembled.  Maintenance checks on process equipment are conducted and documented to ensure proper operations of the chlorination system.

This facility has a chlorine scrubber system for the storage building, along with chlorine leak detectors in the storage, feed and at all points of chemical application. The leak detectors activate a visual and audible alarm that alerts the facility staff to any release. If such a release does occur unforeseeably, the Southeast Water Purification Plant's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Trained personnel with the Houston Fire Department's HazMat team and the vendor/manufacturer supplying this facility with chlorine respond to chlorine releases as needed. Drinking Water Operations Chemical Spill Response Coordinator and the City of Houston's Safety Department personnel also respond to chlorine releases. Additionally, the facility is also coordinated with the City of Houston's Hazardous Materials Response Unit and the City of Pasadena Park Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise. \n\nThe Southeast Water Purification Plant has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.   The following sections briefly described the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.\n\nSafety Information\n\nComprehensive chemical data has been assembled.  Operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes along with Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are onsite.

The Southeast Water Purification Plant's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area. There are two regulated substances present at the facility, chlorine and ammonia. The regulated substances are both used in the disinfection process.   However, a Risk Management Plan for ammonia is no longer required due to the decrease in the percent concentration being below 20%.  \n\nThe Southeast Water Purification Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. New equipment, processes and equipment are evaluated in our quest to improve safety and reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine gas at the plant.  No changes in the process management are currently anticipated.\n\nRegulated Substance\n\nThere is one regulated chemical at the facility; chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 72,000 pounds. Chlorine containers and equipment, except the chlorine scrubber, are housed inside the chlorine building.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidental releases involving chlorine that resulted in any offsite impacts.  There have been no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nEmployees, supervisors and managers are responsible for complying with the RMP regulations.
