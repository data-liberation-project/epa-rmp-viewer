GBB will meet or exceed Federal, State, and Local regulations and other legal requirements.\n\nGB Biosciences will use the following CORE Values to ensure Operational Excellence and drive continuous HSE improvement:\n\nDrive\nGBB employees are responsible for the HSE performance of the facility.  Through setting aggressive goals and objectives, GBB will strive for continuous improvement in all aspects of Health, Safety, Process Safety, and Environmental performance.\n\nAgility\nGBB will develop a culture which encourages employees to take personal responsibility for HSE.  Employee engagement in HSE activities allows quick response and adaption to situations in the work environment.\n\nCapability\nGBB will ensure HSE considerations are integrated into all activities.  Employees that have ownership in HSE will be capable of eliminating all incidents and injuries.\n\nSynergy\nGBB will openly communicate HSE performance and share incidents and best practices within the site and throughout Syngenta.  The site will seek out HSE best practices from within Syngenta and other industries in its efforts to continue to achieve leading performance in HSE.\n\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe GB Biosciences facility produces agricultural chemicals.  The plant has three covered processes A? Isophthalonitrile (IPN), Chlorothalonil (CTL), and chlorine distribution.  The CTL unit produces the fungicide Chlorothalonil which goes into the trade name products DaconilA? and BravoA?.  Chlorothalonil is a fungicide for bananas, potatoes, peanuts, turf and other crops.  \n\nThe IPN is produced by reacting ammonia and meta-xylene in the presence of oxygen and a catalyst.  Ammonia enters the plant by rail car or tank truck, and is stored in a 12,000 gallon storage tank.  Meta-xylene enters th"

Chlorine comes into the plant in 180,000 pound rail cars and is then transferred to the CTL unit via pipeline.  The liquid chlorine is vaporized in the CTL unit and is then fed into the process.\n\nThe CTL unit takes IPN reacts it in vapor phase with Chlorine in the presence of a catalyst to form Chlorothalonil.  Raw CTL is sent to the formulations unit to be packaged and shipped to customers around the world.     \n\n\nPrevention Program Level 3\n\nIn addition to complying with EPAA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68), GB Biosciences is governed by the OSHA Process Safety management Standard.  There are two (2) regulated chemicals above the threshold quantity-ammonia and chlorine.  GB Biosciences has identified three covered processes A? IPN process, CTL process, and chlorine distribution.  The processes correspond to the plant layout and the way the process hazard analyses (PHA) were performed.  Each process unit conducted a global process hazard analysis using the HAZOP methodology.  Projects and changes are handled with management of change (MOC) procedures.  As required, these changes undergo an appropriate PHA (What if/Checklist, Checklist, FMEA, Fault tree, etc.).  The PHAs presented in the RMP Plan are the comprehensive unit HAZOPs.  On a five year interval, the unit HAZOPs are re-validated and updated according to PHA findings.\n\nThe equipment for each area has been screened to determine if it can result in a catastrophic release to the environment.  This equipment has been classified as PSM covered.  This equipment is inspected on a frequency determined internally, based on past performance.  Any problems found during the inspections are repaired in a timely manner.\n\nThere are both operating and maintenance procedures for each unit.  These procedures are reviewed and certified on an annual basis.  GB Biosciences has"

Individuals affected by a procedure must perform a CBT for that procedure and pass a subsequent written test once per year.

The incident occurred on March, 11, 2009 and involved the release of less than 1 pound of chlorine from the CTL process during a maintenance activity.  The incident resulted in one on-site contractor injury.\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe Greens Bayou site has a 24 hour emergency response system in place.  The site operates under an Incident Command System (ICS) for all emergencies.  GB Biosciences has personnel on site trained to respond to fires, hazardous material releases, medical needs, and rescue situations 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Emergency team members are issued alpha numeric pagers so that they can be notified for assistance as needed.  The shift facilitator is the Incident Commander.  Quarterly training is received by all emergency responders.\n\nGB Biosciences is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization (CIMA).  CIMA is one of the largest mutual aid organizations offering emergency response assistance to member companies.  GB Biosciences participates in annual functional emergency response drills and training days with CIMA.\n\nAdditionally, GB Biosciences has representation on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group.  GB Biosciences personnel also participate in functional drills with the LEPC and the CAER group.  Both of these groups include the local fire department, sheriffA?s department, ambulance services, local hospital, neighboring industries "

Critical plant personnel are also equipped with portable radios to aid in communications during an emergency.  Radios are also in place for instant communications with neighboring industries and other CIMA members.  Mobile radios have access to common state wide mutual air frequencies to contact the fire department and ambulance service, including the local air ambulance (Life Flight).  The LEPC has installed an area telephone alerting system, known as First Call, to contact area residents in the event of an incident that might have impact on the community.\n\nGB Biosciences has its own internal fire water system (with backup supply).  Most operating areas have fixed fire water systems installed and perimeter fixed fire monitors.  The plant has two fixed chlorine monitoring systems: the first is a series of fixed monitors throughout the CTL unit and the second is a detection and shut off for the Heating, Venting and Air Conditioning systems to occupied buildings.  In the event of a leak an alarm in the CTL control room is activated.  Video monitors have been installed in some areas allowing for continuous monitoring, primarily of railcar unloading areas.\n\nLocal, state, and federal environmental agencies are contacted if the notification of an environmental release is necessary.\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety:\n\nA? An ammonia deluge system was expanded in the ammonia railcar unloading area.  This will provide a more effective water curtain in the event of a release.\nA? The Chlorine Super heaters were upgraded to a more reliable design reducing the opportunity for a release\nA?
