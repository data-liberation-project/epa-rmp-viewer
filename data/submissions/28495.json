The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\u00b7\tIntroduction;\n\u00b7\tFacility identification and regulated substances;\n\u00b7\tPolicies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00b7\tPrevention Program;\n\u00b7\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7\tEmergency Response Plan; and\n\u00b7\tPlanned Changes to improve safety.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\nIBA Sterilization and Ionization, Inc. (IBA S&I) and Sterigenics (an IBA company) will operate a contract sterilization facility located in Grand Prairie, Texas.  The facility will be engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68).  \nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at IBA/Sterigenics - Grand Prairie.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  IBA/Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program \nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program will be in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68) upon startup of the facility. The prevention program will provide a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the proposed prevention program i"

Examples of safety equipment to be installed include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  \n\nIn addition, process operators will receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and will be required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  IBA/Sterigenics will implement a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, IBA/Sterigenics will develop an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility.   This emergency response plan will be in place prior to the startup of the facility.  Summary information from the initial development of the plan can be found in Appendix C.\n\nHazard"

      "SummaryText": "Evaluation\nUnder the EPA regulations, IBA/Sterigenics is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst-case release and an alternative release scenario.  The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst-case and alternative scenarios for the facility. \n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \u00bfthe release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a) (40 CFR 68.3). The worst-case scenario for toxic gases is assumed to be the total release of the single largest container in the process over a 10 minute time period.  Thus, for the Grand Prairie facility, it is assumed that 400 lbs of ethylene oxide is released over a 10-minute time period. The ethylene oxide cylinders will be maintained in an outdoor, fenced staging area prior to use. The staging area will be directly exposed to the surrounding atmosphere therefore it is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinders will be released to the atmosphere.  The release rate was then calculated using the information given in Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis document (EPA 550-B-99-009, April 15, 1999) and the program RMP*Comp, and the distance to endpoint was determined.  This distance is beyond the facility fence line.\n\nAlthough IBA/Sterigenics recognizes the maximum potential impacts resulting from a release of ethylene oxide, it believes this scenario to be unlikely.  IBA/Sterigenics will implement extensive safeguards to prevent such a release such as:  computer controls on all sterilizers, interlock alarms associated with each sterilizer, and installation of process area monitors to detect any leaks.\n\nIn accordance with Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis document (EPA 550-B-99-009, April 15, 1999), the alternative scenario evaluated was assumed to consist of a leaking valve on a cylinder of e"

      "SummaryText": "thylene oxide. The leaking valve results in a release of ethylene oxide to the inside of the building, and the vapor cloud is assumed to travel outside and downwind.  This release is assumed to result from a quarter-inch diameter leak from the valve on a 400 lb vessel pressurized at 50 psig.  The release rate was determined based on Equation 7-1 in Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis document (EPA 550-B-99-009, April 15, 1999) and using the program RMP*Comp. The cylinder is assumed to be in use during the leak, therefore a 55% mitigation factor was taken into account resulting from containment within a permanent structure.  The release rate from the building to the outside atmosphere was then calculated and the distance to endpoint was determined.  This distance is beyond the facility fence line. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n1.\tThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2.\tThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\u00b7\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n\u00b7\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe Grand Prairie facility is currently under construction and has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Grand Prairie facility are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Grand Prairie City Fire Department.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a reportable spill, IBA/Sterigenics also notifies the appropriate local, state, and federal e"

Exposure risks to employees and the public will be minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  Since this facility is currently under construction, no further improvements have been identified. \n\nChemical-Specific Safety\nEthylene oxide is stored in an outdoor, well-ventilated staging area and away from incompatible chemicals and sources of ignition.  Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves. Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and some of the chamber doors that will alarm with an audible alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
