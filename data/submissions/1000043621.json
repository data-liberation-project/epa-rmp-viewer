This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the NGL transloading and storage system. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nOxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC covered process is the equipment and piping associated with the NGL transloading and storage system located at 565 Gusher Road in Levelland, TX.  The regulated substances are isobutane and pentane. The main operation is described below: \r\nNGLs are received through a pipeline into bullet style storage tanks. Pumps are used to push the NGLs out of the storage tanks and into railcars.  Railcars and storage tanks can also be loaded by truck.\r\nNo reactions or conversion are taking place at Oxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC, therefore no process chemistry is in order and does not need to be accounted for.\r\nThe maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 1,900,000 pounds of pentane, and 920,000 pounds of isobutane.    \r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined for the covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment report, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.  \r\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.  \r\n\r\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\r\nAlthough the storage and use of pentane and iso-butane has inherent potential risks and the worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community, Oxy Levelland Terminal Company, LLC has recognized these potential risks and"
