      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nGPU Generation, Inc. (GPU Genco) operates a coal-fired, electric power generating station near Shelocta, Pennsylvania. This 1,459-acre facility, known as Keystone Station, is located 45 miles northwest of Johnstown, PA, and 14 miles west of Indiana, PA near state route 210 and US route 422.  \n\nKeystone station employs almost 200 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees.  The secondary economic impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  For example, the station provides employment for many coal miners and trucking firms.\n\nThe station is a major component of the billion-dollar power development in the Chestnut Ridge area.  The station was constructed by investor-owned utilities representing four eastern states.  GPU Genco operates Keystone station as agent for the following utility owners (with percentage of ownership):\n\n - Atlantic City Electric, based in Pleasantville, N.J. (2.47%)\n - Baltimore Gas and Electric, based in Baltimore, Md. (20.99%)\n - Delmarva Power and Light, based in Wilmington, Del. (3.70%)\n - Jersey Central Power and Light, based in Morristown, N.J. (16.67%)\n - Pennsylvania Power and Light, based in Allentown, Pa. (12.34%)\n - PECO Energy, based in Philadelphia, Pa. (20.99%)\n - Public Service Electric and Gas, based in Newark, N.J. (22.84%)\n\nThe facility generates 1700 MW of power from two identical, 850 MW units.  Each unit has a state-of-the-art pollution control system for particulate and special burners to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nGPU Genco's policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES - This facility is a coal-fired, electric power generating station.\n\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES - Anhydrous "

      "SummaryText": "ammonia is used at Keystone station as a fluegas conditioner.  The ammonia improves the ability of the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to remove particulate from the flue gas.  In this process, the ammonia is converted to ammonium sulfate and removed from the flue gas as particulate.  \n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\n\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED - The anhydrous ammonia is transported, stored and conveyed as a liquid to evaporators. A single 18,000-gallon tank located outdoors adjacent to the Unit No. 2 ESP is used to store the anhydrous ammonia liquid. The storage tank is kept under pressure to maintain the ammonia in liquid form. Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% level.  \n\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\na. THE SCENARIOS - The worst-case release scenario assumes that the ammonia storage tank catastrophically ruptures, and the entire contents are released as a vapor over 10 minutes.  The quantity released in the 10-minute event is calculated as:\n\n18,000 gallons * 85% *5.66 lb/gal = 86,598 lb\n\n\n\n\n\nb. The alternative release scenario assumes that the entire contents of a 4,000-gallon ammonia tank truck are spilled into the paved unloading area and evaporate over a 10-minute period (due to, for example, an unloading hose rupture). The quantity released in the 10-minute event is calculated as:\n\n4,000 gallons * 5.66 lb/gal = 22,640 lb\n\nBecause both the ammonia tank truck and the ammonia storage tank have excess flow valves which would close upon the increase in flow from a hose rupture, this is a very unlikely scenario.\n\nc. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT - The offsite consequences of these accidental releases were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, version 1.06).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following weather conditions: a wind sp"

The more typical meteorological parameters used in analyzing the alternative release scenario include a mean wind speed of 6.7 mph and \"D\" atmospheric stability.\n\nThe maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 3.4 miles for the worst-case scenario.  This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  For the alternative release scenario, the maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is a more realistic 0.3 miles.\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThere are many safety programs in place at the station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\n\n- A comprehensive process safety management (PSM) program has been implemented for all ammonia process equipment.  This includes daily visual inspections, periodic mechanical integrity checks, and operator training.\n\n- The ammonia storage tank is a registered pressure vessel that is built to exacting standards.\n\n- Ammonia tank trucks are only unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays.\n\n- Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% level.\n\n- Excess flow valves are mounted on all storage tank liquid lines.\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY - No accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have occurred during the past five years at this site.\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - In the unlikely event that an accidental release of ammonia would occur, the station has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan.  This plan has been in place for many years, and yearly drills are held to test the plan under simulated conditions.\n\n\n7.
