      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nConstellation Brands U.S. Operations dba Mission Bell Winery is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia and sulfur dioxide processes, and only trained personnel are permitted to operate the systems.  Mission Bell Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Mission Bell Winery is located at 12667 Road 24 in Madera, California.  The facility utilizes several RMP-regulated processes to conduct operations, and they are described as follows.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used in the facility's refrigeration systems to provide cooling to either glycol or wine product.  In general, liquid ammonia is fed from a receiver to several chillers, where it is vaporized as it absorbs heat from the glycol / wine product.  The vapor is pulled off from the chillers by the compressors and discharged to the condensers.  At the condensers, the vapor is condensed back into liquid, which then drains to the receiver to be re-used in the refrigeration cycle.  The RMP-regulated refrigeration systems employed at Mission Bell Winery are listed below, along with their maximum intended inventory:\n\n?    550 Refrigeration - 35,000 lbs\n\n?    Black Grape - 28,000 lbs\n\n\n\nAmmonia is also used as a neutralizing agent in a neutralization process.  Ammonia is fed from a storage tank to process water a"

A maximum of 43,580 pounds of ammonia is used in the system.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide as a wine preservative.  Sulfur dioxide is transfilled from a one-ton container to smaller portable cylinders.  These cylinders are then used where needed for the wine making process.  The winery also stores several one-ton containers as backup for the transfill process.  The maximum intended inventory is 22,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nMission Bell Winery has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with OSHA's PSM, EPA's RMP, and the Cal-OES CalARP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n?    Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n\n?    Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n\n?    Training for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n?    Written procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\n\n?    Conducting periodic inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of process equipment;\n\n?    Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\n\n?    Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\n\n?    Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n\n?    Employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, several controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels and fusible plugs on the one-ton sulfur dioxide containers prevent equipment rupture in the event o"

Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place). \n\n\n\nIn addition, there have been no releases of ammonia from the 550 Refrigeration System, Black Grape System, and Ion Exchange/Vacuum Pan neutralization process that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  Nor have there been any sulfur dioxide releases in the last five years that meet the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMission Bell Winery has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The ERP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) handling chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and in-house emergency response personnel and 4) administering first aid measures for chemical exposure.  Employees perform drills and receive refresher training on the ERP.  In the event of a chemical release, trained emergency response personnel will assess the situation and contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the regulated processes, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.
