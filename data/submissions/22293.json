Additionally, WTP employees are trained and equipped to handle incidental releases of chlorine at the WTP."

SACWSD has demonstrated its commitment to safety at the Klein Water Treatment Plant (WTP) by upgrading the chemical feed process for chlorine to a vacuum system in 1999 and installing a chlorine scrubber at the time of construction of the WTP.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe Klein WTP is located at 7400 Quebec Street in Commerce City, Colorado.  Chlorine is used at the facility to provide disinfection of the public water supply.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders, and no more than eight cylinders of chlorine (16,000 pounds) of chlorine are stored at the Klein WTP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst case release scenario involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single cylinder outside of any enclosure.  The rule for worst case release analysis assumes the entire release will occur in 10 minutes.  The alternative case release scenario was based on process hazard analysis, and assumes the release of 600 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes as a result of a drop scenario outside of containment.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios was analyzed using RMP*Comp (an EPA program), and the analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles and an alternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on the written operating procedures for the Klein WTP, as well as a maintenance, inspection, and testing program utilized within the covered process.  These programs all serve to prevent or minim"
