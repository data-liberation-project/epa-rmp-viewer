      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nAmerican Water Services provides contract operations and maintenance services for the City of Houston's Southeast Water Purification Plant (SEWPP). The facility is located at 3100 Genoa-Red Bluff Road in Houston, Texas, and borders the north side of Ellington Air Force Base. The system is designed to treat up to 80 MGD of drinking water for the City of Houston and surrounding municipalities. Chloramination is the selected method of disinfection to reduce the risk of waterbourne disease, providing a long lasting capability that precludes the liklihood of disinfection by-products being generated. Due to the quantity of chlorine and ammonia that must be stored at the facility, the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations apply for these process chemicals.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nAmerican Water Services has committed itself to reducing the likelihood of an accidental chemical release from the SEWPP. The facility staff conducts an annual review of all operating, safety, maintenance and emergency response procedures. Additionally, refresher training for the facility staff, the fire department emergency response teams and training for all new employees and contractors is a priority. Operations personnel are required to conduct daily checks of the chlorine and ammonia storage and delivery systems and any potential problem is immediately corrected. A chlorine scrubber system is provided for the storage building, along with chlorine leak detectors in the storage, feed and at all points of chemical application. These systems are tested routinely to ensure that they function properly. The leak detectors activate a visual and audible alarm that alerts the facility staff to any release. The SEWPP operations comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements, and strives to maintain a safe working environment for its employees and the surrounding community.\n\nChemical Quantities and Storage\n\nThe SEWPP utilizes one ton chlorine containers for the faci"

The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia solution is 66,900 lbs.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's Risk Management Program requires that two accidental release scenarios be considered for each covered chemical, considered as a worst case and alternative case scenarios. EPA's RMPComp program was used to evaluate both the worst case and alternative case options. Results can be found in the RMP.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe emergency response program in place for the SEWPP includes training for the facility staff and the City of Houston Fire Department Emergency Response Team. The program defines appropriate response proceedures in the event of any accidental release. All members of the facility staff have been trained in the proper evacuation procedures, and are aware of their designated roles during an emergency event. The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and revised as necessary.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerican Water Services has operated the SEWPP since August of 2001 without a major release event. However, there is always the possibility for such a release. Proper training and close adherence to defined safety protocols and procedures is the best way to mitigate against a potential release event. The facility staff strives to remain well trained and equipped to deal with any possible emergency, and continues to look for ways to improve  safety for our staff and the surrounding community."
