By using this method we teach our employees that at all times, they are to wear the following protective equipment: insulated gloves, protective goggles that cover across the eyes and the width of the face, and to know direction of wind and the correct escape route.  Our employees must wear clothing that covers the entire surface of the body such as jeans or other leg protecting garments, and long sleeve shirts are preferred.  Clothes are close fitting to the body to prevent accidents due to loose garments.  A stock tank supply of fresh water is located directly adjacent to the filling pump station.  This provides an area of immediate rescue if a minor release/inhalation were to occur.  We stress to our employees the major importance of following our operating rules and guidelines, how they prevent accidents and, in the event of an accident, prevent serious injury or possible death.  Our employees are instructed never to leave the nurse tank during the duration of the filling process.  All employees are taught from the beginning to end, the explicit instructions to filling the nurse tanks.  An employee is never left alone during the filling process until they are confident they can perform the task in a safe manner.  Filling instructions are posted near the office and in the pump house.  Our employees know that if there is ever a question or something they are unsure of, no matter what it is, they are to ask for help.  Many questions are acceptable whereas one incident is not.  If an accident were to occur, our residents that are in the direct, even indirect, path of the Anhydrous Ammonia cloud would be contacted by our local deputies' siren in their squad cars.  Our contact person for Lane County is Bill Barnett with Emergency Management (during normal hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Frida"

Anhydrous Ammonia is one such produce that is sold.  The Anhydrous Ammonia is trucked in by semis to our main facility located at the herein mentioned location.  It is then off loaded into our bulk tank and stored until needed.  Currently, we have 30 nurse tanks for the benefit and convenience of our local farmers.  Each nurse tank is filled and checked by our trained employees prior to the farmer receiving one.  \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nAs stated above we us a \"Safety First\" approach to all accidents for the human element.  The storage tank and the nurse tanks have safety precautions as well.  The state of Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our equipment yearly for noticeable issues: signage changes, rust, gauges in date and readable, hoses in date, etc. Any issues found are corrected within six months or less of this inspection.  All equipment is yearly subject to an in house repairs and maintenance inspection as well.    Equipment also have safety valves and safety shut offs in case of emergencies.\r\nThe five-year accident history:\r\nLefty's Soil Service has not had any accidents in the history of th"
