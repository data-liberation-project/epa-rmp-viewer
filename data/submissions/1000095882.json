The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures to the operations level (not a full emergency response team) and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training is conducted annually and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  \n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Cedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) facility's refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n\n\n3. The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were perfor"

The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the Cedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) building.  A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\n\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nEmployee Training\n\nContractor Qualifications\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTrade Secrets\n\n\n\n\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls\n\nOperator Training\n\nComputerized controls\n\n\n\nThe Preventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nA five-year accident history has not been prepared and included in the RMP since there have been no reportable incidents within the last 5 years.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Cedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) has implemented a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Cedar Gro"

      "SummaryText": "ve Warehouse (Schofield) has a detailed Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Cedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care. Cedar Grove Warehouse refrigeration employees are trained to the operations level and will respond to ammonia leaks up to 300 PPM. If the concentration is higher than 300 PPM, the EAP describes that refrigeration employees must evacuate and Fire Department, Hazmat teams summoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nCedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, 5-Year Mechanical Integrity Audit, and 3-Year Compliance Audit.  The flexibility of the program allows Cedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure to Cedar Grove Warehouse (Schofield) employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
