In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is NGL, which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, butane, propane, pentane, iso-pentane, and iso-butane.  These regulated chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility is 30,000 gallons, which contains approximately 140,000 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals.   Because of the overfill protection requirement of NFPA 58, all pressurized storage tanks are limited to a maximum fill capacity not to exceed 80% of the tank capacity. \n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the Program 3 elements.\n\nEmployee Participation ? includes provisions for active participation by plant employees, in the development and implementation of the facility PSM/RMP program as well as ready access to program information, process safety information, which has been collected in the facility office and is summarized in the PSM/RMP manual. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? The required PHAs have been conducted.\n\nOperating Procedures ? Facility operation/maintenance procedures are located at the central control room at the PCGP.\n\nTraining ? Applies to all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the plant operation.\n\nContractor Manag"

Assures that new processes or plant modifications meet the proper criteria before initial startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity ? Ensures the ongoing integrity of the process equipment by establishing and implementing written procedures for systems inspections and maintenance.\n\nHot Work Permits ? Require controls as specified by the Safety Manual and Procedure before hot work is performed on the regulated process.\n\nManagement of change ? Ensures that the proposed system changes are comprehensively evaluated before implementing the change.\n\nIncident Investigation ? The investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the regulated process.\n\nCompliance Audit ? Conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the PSM/RMP program.\n\nAccident History ? The Facility has not had a reportable accident of covered processes in the five years previous to June 21, 1999, the effective date of the RMO regulation or in the five years prior to the submittal date of this revised RMP.\n\nEmergency response Plan ? This facility has established and maintained an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual.\n\nThe goal of the PSM/RMP program is to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical released and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nThe goal of Williams Production RMT Company?s spill policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.
