In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is NGL, which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, butane, propane, pentane, iso-pentane, and iso-butane.  These regulated chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility is 30,000 gallons, which contains approximately 140,000 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals.   Because of the overfill protection requirement of NFPA 58, all pressurized storage tanks are limited to a maximum fill capacity not to exceed 80% of the tank capacity. \n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the Program 3 elements.\n\nEmployee Participation \u00bf includes provisions for active participation by plant employees, in the development and implementation of the facility PSM/RMP program as well as ready access to program information, process safety information, which has been collected in the facility office and is summarized in the PSM/RMP manual. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \u00bf The required PHAs have been conducted.\n\nOperating Procedures \u00bf Facility operation/maintenance procedures are located at the central control room at the PCGP.\n\nTraining \u00bf Applies to all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the plant operation.\n\nContractor Manag"
