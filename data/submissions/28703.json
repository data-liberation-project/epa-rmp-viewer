Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Providence Farm Supply, Inc. in Lockney, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public,\n\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\n\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\n\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\n\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate\n\nour response efforts with the Lockney Fire Department, which provides additional emergency\n\nresponse expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in a 12,000-gallon tank and interconnected 15,000- and 12,000-gallon tanks and 27\n\nnurse tanks (1,000-gallon) at our facility in Lockney (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is\n\n56,100 gallons (288,690.6 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.   The largest single storage\n\nvessel (15,000- and 12,000-gallon interconnected tanks) at our facility contains 118,100.7 pounds\n\nat  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \n\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (118,100.7 pounds) in gaseous form over a\n\n10-minute period.  We anticipated that admi"

Radius2 x 3.14\n\n= area of circle. 4.7 miles2 x 3.14 x  people = approximately 9,780 people within 4.7 mile radius of\n\nthe site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions in a rural\n\nsetting, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure\n\n3).
