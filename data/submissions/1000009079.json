(PPP) and operated by Northern Star Generation Services (NSGS).  The power and steam generated for sale is produced from a single natural gas turbine in combination with a single steam turbine.\n\nMulberry Cogen has two RMP regulated substances at the facility, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  The ammonia is used in a closed loop system for cooling the inlet air to the combustion turbine.  Total quantity in the entire system of vessels and piping is approximately 49,500 lbs.  It is located adjacent to the combustion turbine and its evaporative condenser (Inlet Cooling Tower).  \n\nThe chlorine is stored in three one-ton cylinders located near the two cooling towers.  The chlorine is used for microbiological control in the cooling tower waters.  Whereas most of the chlorine is absorbed and consumed by the water, a low (0.3 ppm free Cl2) residual is maintained in the bulk water.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nMulberry Cogen has had no reportable releases or accidents in the last five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMulberry Cogen Facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local statues governing the storage and use of all chemicals.  This includes compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program, EPA's Risk Management Program, and Hazardous Chemical reporting under SARA Title III.\n\nSince communication and knowledge are important preventative measures in a safety program, a Right-To-Know center in the Control Room provides safety information to all employees, contractors, and visitors to the site.  Contained in the center are Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), the Emergency Response Guidebook, Preparing, Understanding and Using MSDSs, First Aid Tips fr"

      "SummaryText": "om the American Red Cross, the site's specific PPE Requirements Matrix, and Keller's Official OSHA Safety Handbook, Health Effects of Ammonia, and Control of Natural Gas In Emergency.  \n\nThe Mulberry Cogeneration Facility was constructed with many safeguards for chemical handling and usage.  The hazardous liquid chemicals on site, sulfuric acid and caustic, are stored in tanks surrounded by secondary containment.  The pumps used to deliver the chemicals to the various processes are also inside the containment dike.  Chemical piping is double-piped where appropriate.  UV resistant tubing has been employed for delivery of chlorine and other chemicals where tubing is exposed to sunlight.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nNSGS - Mulberry Cogeneration is committed to maintaining a safe working environment while using chemicals necessary for power production and its auxiliary processes. Personnel protective equipment is made available to all employees and training is given annually to demonstrate the proper use of the safety equipment provided. In addition specific training is given each year on regulated substances; ammonia, chlorine,ferrous sulfate, caustic, and sulfuric acid.  The MSDS for new chemicals are routed for all personnel to review. \n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) was written and implemented beginning with construction of the plant and continuing on through present day plant operations.  Features of the EAP include plant communications and alarm systems, evacuation procedures and routes, fire and rescue equipment, general fire protection guidelines, emergency notification procedures and emergency response procedures.  The EAP also includes a separate section on ammonia and chlorine safety and ammonia and chlorine leak procedures.  Employees are trained to be familiar with the contents of the EAP and several copies of the EAP are readily available in the case of an emergency at the facility.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPolk Pow"

      "SummaryText": "er Partners - Mulberry Cogeneration reports the hazardous chemicals on site, amount and location, to both the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire department as required by SARA Title III, Section 313.  The Tier Two Reports submitted are maintained in an active file system in the response vehicle and therefore are readily available to emergency responders to the facility.  Facility personnel are trained how to respond to leaks, including notification procedures.  When possible, any release is first handled by plant personnel.  In the event of a major release, the notification plan in the facility's Emergency Action Plan is implemented. \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNSGS - Mulbery Cogeneration is always looking for ways to improve safety for our employees and those who work around us.  Trade magazines, conferences with other utility industry personnel and discussions with chemical and equipment vendors are some of the ways facility personnel discover new and improved ways of doing business.  The site has a safety representative, who engages in corporate safety activites as well as attends safety training classes and conferences.\n\n03/19/2009\n\n"
