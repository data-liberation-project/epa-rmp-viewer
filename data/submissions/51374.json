The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release of natural gasoline and to minimize the potential impact to ADM\u00bfs employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating response activities with local emergency responders.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled:\nADM Corn Processing at Walhalla is located on 111 acres approximately 1.5 miles east of the city of Walhalla, ND.  The primary activity of the facility is processing corn to manufacture fuel ethanol and distiller\u00bfs grain.\n\nIn this Risk Management Plan (RMP), ADM has included a program for its denaturant used in the production of fuel ethanol.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) used at the facilities generally has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of less than 4 and is exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2).  However, due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, it is possible that ADM will receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has included provisions in the RMP for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.  The regulated substances found in natural gasoline are n-pentane & isopentane. \n\nThe main components of the natural gasoline system are a truck unloading station, an unloading pump, two storage tanks, a transfer pump and associated valves and piping.  Natural gasoline is received by truck only.\n\nGeneral accidental release"

The facility maintains a written Environmental/Emergency Response Plan to deal with prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThere were also several recommended actions that were completed as a result of the process hazard analyses.  These included procedural changes for maintenance of affected equipment and transfer of product and installation of interlocks between pumps and valves.\n\nADM will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the Walhalla facility."
