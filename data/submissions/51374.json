              "Description": "The natural gasoline system consists of a truck receiving station, two storage tanks at ambient temperature and pressure, and a transfer pump to meter the product into a mixing station.\n\nThe natural gasoline storage tanks have clay lined earthen dikes for secondary containment.  The fire protection system consists of heat sensors in each tank, foam fire suppression in each tank, with foam and water cannons around the perimeter of the dike.  The fire system conforms to NFPA standards 11, 13, 16 and 30.  Insurance related standards for this area are FM Global 7-32 and 7-88.  The area is classified as Class 1 Division 2 for electrical equipment.  \n\nA risk-consulting contractor typically conducts semiannual third party audits of the facility, including the natural gasoline system.  Equipment in this system is included in the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program as required by 40 CFR 60 subpart VV.  The natural gasoline tanks are inspected according to the schedule in the facility?s Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan.\n\nStandard operating procedures have been developed and written to safely transfer and store the natural gasoline.  Indicators for remote tank levels are verified quarterly.  Automatic valves and interlocks provide secondary protection from overfilling the tanks or running the pump without flow or grounding protection.\n\nEmployees at this facility use the ADM Behavioral Safety Program for a system of reporting safety observations, auditing safe work practices and investigating incidents for corrective actions.",

The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release of natural gasoline and to minimize the potential impact to ADM?s employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating response activities with local emergency responders.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled:\nADM Corn Processing at Walhalla is located on 111 acres approximately 1.5 miles east of the city of Walhalla, ND.  The primary activity of the facility is processing corn to manufacture fuel ethanol and distiller?s grain.\n\nIn this Risk Management Plan (RMP), ADM has included a program for its denaturant used in the production of fuel ethanol.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) used at the facilities generally has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of less than 4 and is exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2).  However, due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, it is possible that ADM will receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has included provisions in the RMP for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.  The regulated substances found in natural gasoline are n-pentane & isopentane. \n\nThe main components of the natural gasoline system are a truck unloading station, an unloading pump, two storage tanks, a transfer pump and associated valves and piping.  Natural gasoline is received by truck only.\n\nGeneral accidental release "

The facility maintains a written Environmental/Emergency Response Plan to deal with prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThere were also several recommended actions that were completed as a result of the process hazard analyses.  These included procedural changes for maintenance of affected equipment and transfer of product and installation of interlocks between pumps and valves.\n\nADM will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the Walhalla facility."
