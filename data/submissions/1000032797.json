      "SummaryText": "Airgas Specialty Products maintains a comprehensive release prevention program. The policy mandates ANSI K61.1, ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?. Company policy also requires the implementation of specific engineering and administrative controls to prevent releases. Airgas Specialty Products does not respond to releases but maintains an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with local responders.\n\nAqueous ammonia at a concentration greater than 20% is stored and distributed from this location. Ammonia is stored in ASME coded pressure vessels and maintained in totally enclosed systems from storage to distribution vessels, minimizing transfer losses and accidental release potential.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has developed and implemented procedures specific to storage and distribution of ammonia to meet the requirements of a prevention program as outlined in the regulation. Safety information was gathered specific to the process and a hazard review was conducted and operating procedures were written based upon the safety and hazard review. Training was developed and provided to all employees. All other elements of the prevention program have been complied with as well.\n\nThis Airgas Specialty Products location has not had any RMP defined accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of aqueous ammonia. The plan includes procedures for the required notification of emergency response personnel (local fire department, state and federal agencies).\n\nA site security and vulnerability assessment may be required under the Department of Homeland Security, based upon the Tier recommendations, but that has yet to be determined. Aside from these assessments, no engineering or administrative controls are scheduled to be implemented toward the improvement of safety."
