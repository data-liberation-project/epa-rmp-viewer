At this facility, ammonia is used as a raw material to make nitric acid.  Nitric acid is sold as a product and is also used as a raw material later in the ammonium nitrate process.  Ammonia and nitric acid are considered hazardous by the EPA.  Certain safety precautions in handling ammonia and nitric acid are required to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to employees' health, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  These safety precautions are dependent upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and nitric acid combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Dyno Nobel to comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local environmental and safety laws and regulations and conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or the neighboring community.  In keeping with this policy, Dyno Nobel has developed and implemented a Risk Management Program (RMP) to ensure the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The risk management program includes procedures (1) to identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment that helps prevent the accidental release of hazardous chemicals, and (3) for minimizing the consequences of an accidental release should one occur. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility produces nitric acid, ammonium nitrate liquid, and ammonium nitrate prill.  The major processes at this facility include storage of materials, weak nitric acid production, nitric acid concentration (NAC), nitric acid blending, production of ammonium nitrate in"

      "SummaryText": " liquid and solid form, and product handling. \n\n\n\nRMP regulated chemicals handled by this facility are anhydrous ammonia 98% nitric acid, and 84% nitric acid.  Ammonia is delivered to this facility via an underground pipeline and is stored in six high-pressure storage tanks.  Most of the ammonia is sent to the ammonia oxidation process for use as a raw material to produce 56% nitric acid. A portion of the 56% nitric acid is further concentrated to various blends of nitric acid.  The remainder of the 56% nitric acid is neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate solution.  Ninety-eight percent nitric acid is stored in four storage tanks surrounded by a containment dike. Eighty-four percent nitric acid is stored in one 15,000 gallon tank at the acid production area.\n\n\n\nThe amounts of both ammonia and 98% nitric acid stored on-site exceed the RMP threshold quantities and both chemicals are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  For these reasons, both chemicals are subject to the RMP Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThis facility is subject to both EPA's Accidental Release Prevention program and OSHA's PSM program.  Under both of these programs, the facility has outlined specific procedures that it follows to prevent or minimize the release of ammonia and nitric acid to the environment.  Specifically, the facility has performed process hazard analyses (PHA) of the anhydrous ammonia system and nitric acid process and will repeat this process at least every 5 years.  The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system and nitric acid process.  Should a significant change in the anhydrous ammonia or nitric acid systems be made, Dyno Nobel will perform a new PHA and will modify the RMP to reflect the change as appropriate.  The off-site consequence analysis will be"

In addition, the facility regularly performs training of its employees to ensure the procedures developed for the safe use and handling of the ammonia and nitric acid are adhered to at all times.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSmall releases of ammonia and nitric acid have occurred over the past 5 years.  These smaller releases did not however, result in any significant injuries or property damage, either on-site or off-site, and are not reported in section six of this RMP.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program, titled \"Emergency Control and Crisis Communication Plan\", a document that has been developed in coordination with the Pike County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has been incorporated into the LEPC's emergency planning and response procedures.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nVarious detection systems such as process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms are in place if a release should occur. This facility has an in-house emergency response team that has the equipment and training necessary to respond effectively to an accidental release of ammonia or nitric acid.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSince the ammonia system and nitric acid process are regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management Program, they will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements.\n\n"
