This\r\ncommitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such\r\nas design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\r\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, the facility will be evacuated and Mecosta County LEPC\r\nand the Remus Fire Department will be contacted for emergency response.\r\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 311 North Sheridan\r\nin Remus, Michigan.\r\nWe have one regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the\r\nmanufacturing of cheese.\r\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\r\nforth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. Only one of the processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM\r\nstandard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. Landview software was used to determine the population potentially affected if the WCS were actually to occur.\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\r\nstationary source.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\r\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes a"

Any findings related\r\nto the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company\r\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\r\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\r\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\r\noperators involved in the processes.\r\nTraining\r\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\r\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher\r\ntraining is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed. All training will be documented\r\nand validated by employees on the LFC Training Tracking System.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\r\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage\r\ntanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\r\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\r\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified\r\nby the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\r\nequipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into\r\noperation.\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under\r\nthe RMP rule are being implemented.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response\r\nshould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n4 Five-year Accident History\r\nOn July 15, 2007, at approximately 4:15 - 4:30 PM, Leprino facility personnel in the Cheese processing area of the facility first became aware of the accidental release after hearing a loud pop sound (assumed to be the sound of the pipe rupture) in the vicinity of the main processing freezer and then they began smelling Ammonia. The facility discovered that the source of the Ammonia leak was a ruptured supply line that was located immediately upstream of a refrigeration coil bank. The coil bank is located in a large freezer that is used to freeze the cheese that is manufactured in our facility. The cause of the rupture in the pipe was likely the result of liquid Ammonia being trapped between two flow control valves in a section of pipe. As the liquid Ammonia began to warm it started trying to expand inside the pipe, eventually exceeding the wall strength of the pipe and rupturing the pipe at its weakest point. Leprino employees initially calculated the total release quantity as 13,500 pounds using assumed pumping rates and unrestricted flow through the rupture. Since that initial calculation Leprino employees have had a chance to do a more thorough investigation and has recalculated the total quantity released as 8620 pounds. This calculation is based on system displacement after repair. We believe this quantity best represents the actual Ammonia loss in connection with this incident. This calculation has been reviewed by our Engineering group and a third-party Ammonia refrigeration contractor.\r\n5 Emergency Response Plan\r\nLeprino Foods Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of"

      "SummaryText": "hazardous materials. The plan addresses emergency actions, medical treatment, evacuations, and notification\r\nof local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\nIn addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that\r\nwould require a modified emergency response.\r\nMecosta County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our\r\naccidental release prevention program. Landview Software estimated that the population for the Alternate Release Scenario was 0. The EPA was contacted to determine what we should do as we know that number is wrong and Barbara Benoy said to give our best estimate and how we arrived at it. We estimated the population of the inclusion area of the ARS by taking the population of the WCS and dividing by the distance and multiplying it by the ARS distance."
