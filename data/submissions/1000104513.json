According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects. Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA. A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined , also following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The alternative release scenario is a gas release of 880 pounds through a valve seal rupture. If the container was not shut off, the contents would be released at a rate of 112 pounds of chlorine per minute over a 51 minute period. More typical weather conditions are also used (wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, atmospheric stability Class D). Other conditions remain the same as in the worst-case scenario (urban topography and no mitigation of the release considered in the analysis.\n\nThe zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is detemined to extend 0.2 miles from the chlorine storage area. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nPRASA complies with PROSHO requirements for Prevention Programs and for Process Safety Management. Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area. Standard operating and maintenance procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program. Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any release. Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur. PRASA periodi"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements. The disinfection process at the Sergio Cuevas Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Sergio Cuevas Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Sergio Cuveas Filtration Plant and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Sergio Cuevas Filtration Plant supplies water to surrounding community. Chlorine is used to disinfect the water destroying microorganisms that cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in ton containers. Chlorine containers are connected to chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate chlorine use. From the chlorinators, chlorine gas is distributed under vacuum to ejectors. The ejectors combine the gaseous chlorine with water. The chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for disinfection.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The worst-case release scenario is a chlorine gas release of the entire contents of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of chlorine per minute). Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which"
