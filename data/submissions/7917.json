      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nScovill Fasteners uses chlorine to treat wastewater from brass and copper plating operations.  The chlorine operations consist of three 2,000 pound cylinders containing chlorine liquefied under pressure.  Chlorine from the cylinders is piped to a vaporizer.  From the vaporizer, chlorine is piped to the water treatment system.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored on site is 6,000 pounds.\n \nOur worst case scenario is a failure of all three chlorine cylinders when they are full, resulting in a release of 6,000 pounds of propane.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp, the distance to the endpoint is 2.3 miles. There are approximately 2,869 people living within this distance based on the most recent census data. There are three schools and a hospital within this distance. The alternative case scenario for our facility results in a 0.2 mile distance to the endpoint. There are approximately 39 people living within this distance.\n    \nWe have never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n    \nIn the event of an emergency involving our chlorine system, it is our policy to notify the Clarkesville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our chlorine system. They have the equipment necessary to control an emergency of this magnitude, and we have documentation from them verifying this.\n\n\n\n"
