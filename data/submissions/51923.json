The RMP incorporates various required elements into a program designed to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and establish emergency response preparedness in the event of an accidental release of such regulated substances. The RMP must be submitted to the EPA by the owner or operator of any facility that has a process containing more than the threshold quantity of any of the regulated substances that is covered under the RMP rule. Pursuant to the RMP rule, Bessemer Water Filtration Facility (BWFF) has submitted this RMP for chlorine. \n \nChlorine is used at the Bessemer Water Treatment Facility exclusively as a reagent for the water treatment process. The quantity stored on site exceeds the 2,500-pound threshold for coverage under the RMP program. Except during delivery, all of the chlorine is stored within an enclosed building.\n\nBWFF operates the water treatment facility located in Bessemer, Alabama in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of BWFF employees, contractor employees, the public and the environment. In addition, BWFF is committed to operating the water treatment facility in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, federal regulatory requirements and applicable state and/or local requirements.\n\nBWFF previously developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for chlorine. The OSHA PSM rule guides employees in the preventative maintenance, safe management and operation of processes that use regulated "

The USEPA's RMP regulation builds and expands upon the OSHA PSM program by requiring facilities to evaluate off-site impacts to public and environmental receptors, in the event of an accidental release. Key elements of the OSHA PSM program have been incorporated into the USEPA RMP regulation.\n\nAs part of the USEPA RMP effort, BWFF has updated the OSHA PSM program for chlorine and the associated Hazard Review Analysis.  Among the other important components of BWFF's RMP are the policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the facility, and facility-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP). \n\nThe Facility Manager has the primary responsibility for this RMP and its implementation.\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe BWFF is an 18 million-gallon-per-day water treatment and filtration system, operated by Covanta Water Systems for the City of Bessemer, Alabama.  \n\nOne process at the BWFF involves the use of a substance regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, thereby requiring the preparation and implementation of an RMP. This covered process is the water treatment process (discussed in Section 1.1 above) that utilizes chlorine. \n\nChlorine is stored at the BWFF in excess of the regulated quantity. Both passive and active mitigation measures are used by the BWFF to limit the likelihood and/or severity of an accidental release of chlorine. Passive mitigation systems do not require human, mechanical or energy input, such as the concrete storage building where the chlorine cylinders are stored. Conversely, active mitigation systems do require human, mechanical or energy input for initiation. Leak detectors and alarms, chlorine scrubber, pressure sensing valves, and emergency shut-off devices are examples of the active mitigation systems in place at the BWFF. \n\n1.3 WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA summary of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) "

While the RMP rule originally required that the executive summary briefly describe the OCA for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, the USEPA amended the RMP rule in 2004 to remove this requirement because of security concerns.\n\nIn the event of an actual release, all of the active and passive mitigation systems/features that are available on the chlorine system at the BWFF would be used to contain the spread of any accidental release and mitigate potential impacts of the release. The mitigation systems/features include: an 8-inch concrete block building where the chlorine cylinders are located and associated equipment, leak detectors and alarms, excess flow valves, pressure sensing valves, emergency shutoff devices and the Sentry 2000 chlorine scrubber system. \n\n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBWFF has an accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance. This program is documented in the RMP, and meets the requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\nBWFF provides process safety information to employees through written materials, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, various operating and maintenance manuals, system descriptions and safety procedures.

Since there has not been an accidental release, there has not been a need for sheltering in place or evacuation; nor has damage to property or environmental receptors ever occurred as a result of an accidental release. \n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n \nBWFF has a site-specific Community Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by BWFF employees in the event of an accidental release of chlorine. This ERP has been communicated to two local Fire Departments (Birmingham Fire Department and Concord Fire Department), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). Individuals who are likely to witness or discover a release have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities. It is currently BWFF's policy that individuals that have received the requisite training will attempt to secure a release of chlorine if the action can be taken without significant risk of injury or death. The Incident Commander from the local emergency response agency is presently responsible for determining when sheltering-in-place or evacuation of off site areas is necessary, and also for public notification.\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis RMP incorporates existing Facility procedures, which are designed to improve employee safety awareness and enhance safe operations. Further, emergency response procedures have been reviewed and coordinated with local response entities to increase the speed and effectiveness of a response should a release occur."
