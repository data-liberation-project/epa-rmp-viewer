Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Reed Facility located approximately 400 yards North of Highway 9 on County Road 1840 in Reed, OK 73554.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Reed Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Reed Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP and is resubmitting it as a 5-Year update.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case scenario and alternative case scenarios.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Reed Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial truck and then transferred to one (1) on-site 18,000-gallon storage tank.  The commercial truck operator performs the transfer.  \n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in its single on-site storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its Risk Management Program that includes a prevention program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario"

      "SummaryText": " release for the Reed Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 1.5-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Depot Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Depot Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the prevention program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelenaA?s Reed Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Reed Facility.\n\nCO"
