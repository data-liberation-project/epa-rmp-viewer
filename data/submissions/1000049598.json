      "SummaryText": "This Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Nutrition facility is located at 585-625 Cleveland Avenue in Columbus, Ohio.  Abbott manufactures infant formula and adult medical nutritional products.  This facility also houses pilot plant and division offices.\r\n\r\nNone of the materials used in the manufacture or packaging of these food products are considered to be regulated substances under Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  The sole regulated chemical at the facility is ammonia which is used in a closed loop refrigeration system to produce frigid water.   \r\n\r\nThe facility operates a single, closed-loop ammonia system.  All of the ammonia handling equipment and piping is located in the site's Energy Center.  The ammonia system is used to chill water to 33 - 40 degrees F.  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool equipment and storage tanks.  At no time does the ammonia come in contact with the water.  A detailed description of the ammonia refrigerant process is included in Section 7, under the \"Prevention Program Description.\" \r\n\r\nSince the system received its initial charge, very little ammonia has been added.  Ammonia deliveries and releases are rare occurrences.  There has been one minor accidental ammonia in the past five years; the release had no off-site impacts and no injuries occurred.  This may be attributed to the facility's accidental release prevention program that combines the newest equipment technologies with detailed operational procedures, training and system management practices.  \r\n\r\nIn-plant emergency response procedures have been developed that incorporate both Abbott resources and emergency response services available within Columbus and Franklin County.  The site maintains a highly trained work force that is extremely familiar with the ammonia system and able to respond to any contingency.  \r\n\r\nThe site also has an Emergency Response Team (ERT) on site which is staffed on each of the three shifts.  \r\n\r\nImplementation and maintena"

      "SummaryText": "nce of systems and programs discussed in this report have the full support of Abbott management.  Abbott has a global environmental, health & safety policy that applies to all Abbott locations worldwide.  The policy explicitly requires all locations to: \"maintain a safe and healthy workplace and environment;\" and, \"comply with all applicable laws... designed to protect human health, safety and the environment.'   \r\n\r\nThe site's general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\tHigh level of training for the operators;\r\n\tPreventive Maintenance Program;\r\n\tProcess and safety equipment;\r\n\tAccurately written operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\r\n\tRegular hazard reviews of equipment and procedures; and\r\n\tOngoing auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nAmmonia-specific exposure prevention steps include: the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus for operators; controlled access to the ammonia equipment rooms; ammonia detectors; and a  Process Safety Management program.  \r\n\t  \r\nTo ensure continuing proper operation, each piece of ammonia equipment is monitored through the facility's Preventative Maintenance (PM) program. The PMs are generated automatically from a computer database. Equipment is inspected and serviced during these PMs.  Equipment condition is documented.  In addition to the PM system, each year during the plant shutdown a certified ammonia contractor performs a complete inspection of each compressor.  The certified contractors also check other pieces of ammonia equipment such as alarms and control systems.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the ammonia system's list of safety features are relief valves.  Safety relief valves allow the system to relieve over-pressurization in a controlled manner avoiding a dangerous buildup of pressure.  All safety valves are piped into a common relief piping system that has both a rupture disk and an ammonia detector in the piping at the discharge point. The detecto"

All safety valves are replaced every five years.\r\n\r\nA \"worst-case scenario\" using conditions predefined by U.S. EPA requires dispersion modeling to reflect all of the following assumptions: all control devices fail; the Energy Center building collapses; the entire contents of the ammonia system are released into the environment in ten minutes; and atmospheric conditions are selected that minimize downwind mixing.  It is Abbott's strong contention that equipment design, rarely opening the system to add or remove ammonia, frequent inspection and maintenance, and high level of training provided to site personnel make the actual probability of a \"worst case\" release an extremely remote occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe results of the worst-case scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Depending on wind direction, a long narrow plume could reach one or more of the following potential receptors: residences, schools, recreational areas, industrial and office areas, a hospital or a correctional facility.  Modeling and results are summarized in Section 2.  The modeling software used was RMPComp.\r\n\r\nAn alternate release scenario for the Cleveland Avenue facility involves a break in a liquid level sight glass.  The subsequent ammonia release, contained inside of the Energy Center building and promptly corrected by site personnel, would result in a much smaller off-site impact.  This scenario was selected based on an actual incident that occurred once in site history (but more than five years ago).  \r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario results in a much smaller release that dissipates more quickly under average weather conditions.  Depending on wind speed and direction, this scenario could affect a school or industrial and office areas. \r\n\r\nAbbott is proud of its overall safety and environmental compliance records.
