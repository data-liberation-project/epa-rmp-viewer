Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to to mitigate any release to the population and environment of our community.\n\n2.  a.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers to farmers in the area.  Feeders Grain & Supply has operated a grain elevator in Corning, Iowa for approximately 28 years.  Approximately seven years ago Feeders Grain and Supply installed a anhydrous ammonia tank, approximately three miles east of Corning and one-half mile south of Highway 34 on County Road N52.  The maximum quantity stored at this location is approxmiately  171,800 pounds.   This figure includes or main storage tank and our nurse tanks.   Anhydrous ammonia is not stored at the Corning elevator location.  Feeders Grain & Supply has 11 full time employeees.  During the planting season one employee is located, as needed, at the anhydrous ammonia facility.  During the off-season the anhydrous ammonia facility is not staffed on a regular basis.  The total amount of employee hours spent at the facility, during a year, will not equal the hours required for a full time employee.\n\nb.   During periods of non operation of this anhydrous ammonia facility local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections a various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release  of anhydrous ammonia from our main storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately  2.6  miles.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break i"

This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" \n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program.  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of the equipment and facility.  There are no safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n9.  For Additional Information Contact:\n\n     Mr. Jim Curtis, \n     Feeders Grain & Supply, Inc.\n     P. O.
