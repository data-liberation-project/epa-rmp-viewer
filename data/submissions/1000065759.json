Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\r\n\r\nOak Grove Steam Electric Station complies with applicable federal, state and local regulations.  This facility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nOak Grove Steam Electric Station is located in Franklin, Texas.  This facility is a power generating facility.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)/DeNOx system for the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions from process stack gases.\r\n\r\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nPlease reference onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at the Oak Grove Steam Electric Station for offsite consequence analysis data.\r\n\r\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\r\n\r\nOak Grove Steam Electric Station complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia supply and SCR/DeNOx system.  Further, SCR/DeNOx system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the SCR/DeNOx system.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia SCR/DeNOx system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.

Periodic maintenance on the ammonia system is ensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.  \r\n\r\n5.   Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\n6.   Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis power generating facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.  The Robertson County LEPC has been notified regarding the emergency action plan and of the potential nature of an anhydrous ammonia release.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThis facility expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia process. The Oak Grove Steam Electric Station expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
