The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nBashas' Distribution Center has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.

An expansion of the ammonia refrigeration system occurred in 1998.  The facility is located at 200 South 56th Street in Chandler, Arizona 85226.

The ammonia refrigeration system uses 12,800 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the ammonia engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (Controlled Pressure Receiver) - 11,500 pounds in 10 minutes.  The enclosure of the ammonia engine room provides a passive mitigation that limits the release rate to the atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nBased on visual observation of the area immediately surrounding Bashas' Distribution Center, it was determi"

The population was estimated using 1990 census tract data with the Landview. III Environmental Mapping Software.  When calculating population densities for large areas which encompass many tracts, the accuracy is rated as good; however, for small areas that encompass only two or three partial tracts, the population data may be skewed due to the unequal distribution within the tract.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Bashas' Distribution Center facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to protect against extreme pressure conditions.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no ammonia accidents at the facility.
