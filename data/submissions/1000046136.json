The program is designed to inform all Site employees (hereafter referred to as Associates) of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).\n\n\n\nRPC is guided by a set of core values that include:\n\n\n\n-- Cherish Our Culture - Work, learn and celebrate together;\n\n-- Innovate - Imagine what's possible and create what's valued;\n\n-- Be the Trusted First Choice - Listen, understand and deliver for customers like no other company;\n\n-- Better Our Communities - Devote time and talent where we work and live; and\n\n-- Do What's Right - No matter what.\n\n\n\nRPC is committed to an irrevocable obligation to act responsibly in every decision made and with every person encountered. RPC understands it is a trusted steward of its business relationships, its environment and the communities in which it serves. RPC holds itself to the highest set of standards and is about doing what's right...no matter what.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nRich Products Corporation's (RPC's) Brownsville facility (\"RPC-BVL\" or \"Site\") is located at 3555 East 14th Street in the City of Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas and is situated in in an area zoned as medium industrial. The Site occupies an approximately 108,000 square-foot structure that is located on a 12.94-acre parcel of land."

The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 31171 (Seafood Product Preparation and Packaging)\n\n\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system to freeze the shrimp and onion rings, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical, as defined in the USEPA's CAPP and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Site is registered to Program Level 3 under the CAPP program.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Site's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nIn calculating the worst case release scenario, Site personnel have conservatively utilized 100 percent of the largest vessel as the amount released. However, under no circumstances is this analysis intended to indicate that Site personnel fill any vessel to this extent.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect Associates and the community as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Site's prevention program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety"

In addition to the ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system, wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Site has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Site's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment. This fac"
