The dates of the last PHAs or PHA updates are 12/18/98 and1/23/95 for the HF Alkylation and Pretreater units, respectively.  The initial HF Alkylation HAZOP PHA was updated and revalidated utilizing a checklist, whereas an initial PHA was conducted for the Pretreater utilizing the HAZOP technique.  The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. were addressed during the PHAs conducted for this process.  The safeguards identified in Sections 7.4.e., f., and g. apply to both units with the following exceptions: 1) Process controls consisting of scrubbers, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, emergency power, rapid acid transfer (dump) system, remotely operated emergency isolation valves, and double seals on pumps in acid service apply only to the HF Alkylation unit.  2) Mitigation systems consisting of deluge sytem and neutralization apply only to the HF Alkylation unit.  3) The video camera surveillance system used as a detection system applies only to the HF Alkylation unit.  There have been no incidents in this process within the past 5 years involving the release of a RMP regulated substance which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offsite impacts.",

This operating unit is a new facility that started up in 1997.  The second operating area is a vessel used to temporarily store propane that does not meet product specifications.  The dates of the initial PHAs are 6/5/97 and 4/20/94 for the Propane Storage & Transfer and the Off-Spec Propane Storage operating areas, respectively.  A What-If / Checklist was conducted for the initial Propane Storage & Transfer PHA whereas a HAZOP was conducted for the initial Off-Spec Propane Storage PHA.  The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. were addressed during the PHAs conducted for this process.  The safeguards in this prevention program apply to both operating areas with the following exceptions:  1)  Process controls consisting of check valves, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, backup pump, and remotely operated emergency isolation valves only apply to the Propane Storage & Transfer operating area.  2) The deluge sytem for mitigation only applies to the Propane Storage & Transfer operating area. 3) Process area detectors only apply to the Propane Storage & Transfer operating area.

None of the units individually contain a regulated substance above a threshold quantity.  However, the threshold quantity is exceeded when the inventories from all the units are combined.  The dates of the last PHAs or PHA updates are 9/22/95, 8/1/97, 2/22/95, 8/8/97, and 7/21/95 for the Crude Stills, Vacuum Stills, Kerosene Hydrotreater, Diesel Hydrotreater, and the Lowline/SunOlin/Plant Fuel units, respectively.  HAZOPs were conducted for the Crude Stills, Vacuum Stills, Diesel Hydrotreater, and the Low Line/SunOlin/Plant Fuel units units.  A What-If / Checklist was conducted for the Kerosene Hydrotreater.  The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. were addressed during the PHAs conducted for this process.  The safeguards in this prevention program apply to all five units with the following exceptions: 1)  Process controls consisting of vents only apply to the Vacuum Stills, Diesel Hydrotreater and the Lowline/SunOlin/Plant Fuel units.  Automatic shutoffs and interlocks only apply to the Kerosene Hydrotreater, Diesel Hydrotreater, and the Lowline/SunOlin/Plant Fuel units.  Inhibitor addition only applies to the Crude Stills and Kerosene Hydrotreater.  Rupture disks only apply to the Kerosene Hydrotreater.  Remotely operated emergency isolation valves only apply to the Crude Stills, two Vacuum Stills, Kerosene Hydrotreater, and the Diesel Hydrotreater.   2) Sprinkler system for mitigation only applies to the Crude Stills.  There have been no incidents in this process within the past 5 years involving the release of a RMP regulated substance which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offsite impacts.",

              "Description": "This process consists of three processing units; the Isocracker, Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) Hydrotreater, and the Amine unit.  Neither the VGO Hydrotreater nor the Amine unit contain a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  The dates of the last PHAs or PHA updates are 10/23/97, 3/3/94, and 12/12/97 for the Isocracker, VGO Hydrotreater, and the Amine unit, respectively.  The initial PHAs for the Isocracker and the Amine unit were updated and revalidated using the HAZOP technique.  An initial HAZOP PHA was conducted for the VGO Hydrotreater.  The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. were addressed during the PHAs conducted for this process.  The hazard of runaway reaction only applies to the Isocracker.  The safeguards in this prevention program apply to all three units with the following exceptions:  1)  Process controls consisting of emergency power and inhibitor addtion only apply to the Isocracker.  Further, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, quench system and  remotely operated emergency depressuring and isolation valves only apply to the Isocracker and VGO Hydrotreater.  2) Personal hydrogen sulfide monitors used as a detection system on the VGO Hydrotreater and Amine unit do not apply to the Isocracker.  There have been no incidents in this process within the past 5 years involving the release of a RMP regulated substance which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offsite impacts.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources and efforts expended in accident prevention, including compliance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Management systems are in place at the Trainer Refinery to ensure safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes.  Our accident prevention program includes maintaining updated operating procedures and practices as well as extensive personnel training on safety.  We also have highly trained and well-qualified emergency responders onsite 24 hours a day ready to respond to control and mitigate an incident should one occur.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, PA processes raw crude oil into gasoline and other refining products including jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, heavy fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and sulfur.  The LPG products consist of butane and propane which are both regulated flammable substances.  The refinery produces and/or uses other regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, pentane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide which are regulated toxic substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances is failure of a storage vessel resulting in the release of its entire content of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid with no administrative controls in place and the unit shut down for maintenance.  Approximately every 3 to 4 years, the entire unit's inventory of acid is transferred into this vessel for about 30 days until the maintenance is completed.  In evaluating this WCS, the numerous safeguards and passive mitigation that are in place to prevent a release and to minimize any con"

The results of the WCS indicate that such a release would result in offsite impacts to public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for hydrofluoric acid is a failure of a small diameter drain valve on a suction line of a pump.  A quantity of acid could be released over a 10-minute period before the operators isolated the leak.  The elevated water deluge towers would be activated remotely to knock down vapors.   The resulting vapor cloud could reach an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptors.  This event was selected as a more realistic scenario for use in emergency response planning with the community.\n\nTwo (2) worst-case scenarios (WCS) were developed for flammable substances since these scenarios potentially affect different public receptors.  \n\nThe first WCS for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a sphere containing a flammable mixture composed primarily of propane.  Although there are numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to control and mitigate their consequences, no administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.

This event was selected as a more realistic scenario for use in emergency response planning with the community.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Trainer Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Trainer Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team as well as incident/near miss investigations.  Information on the refinery's accident prevention program is available to all employees and they are encouraged to suggest improvements to any of the programs.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives to address process safety and employee safety issues.  These activities include committees to promote and address both process and personal safety such as the Joint Management Labor Health & Safety Committee, Safe Operations Committee, and PSM subcommittees.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits of critical and key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location, and updating procedure is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, chemical reactivity/stability hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  For specific process units and operations, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific critical operating and key process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, and composition) as part of procedures for normal operations.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents including piping and instrumentation diagrams that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not comprom"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators for refresher training purposes and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. \n\nThe procedures are maintained and updated by the unit operating personnel to reflect comments from users and changes made through the management of change process.  The procedures are reviewed annually to ensure they are current and accurate.  Written operating procedures are readily available to all personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Trainer Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive fundamental training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives unit-specific training.  This training provides the skills and knowledge required to perform the duties of a specific job in operations, and is provided to both New Hires who complete Fundamentals, as well as incumbent operators who are cross training on other jobs.  Job specific training provides detailed instruction on the process and process equipment.  This phase of training includes hands-on demonstrations (or simulations) of start-up, shutdown and emergency operating procedures.  It also includes the review and practice of routine, job-specific tasks performed by the operator (e.g. drawing and testing samples).  \n\nAfter operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests & skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perfor"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Trainer Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of highly experienced people who have operating, engineering, and safety expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete or resolved.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Trainer Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Trainer Refiner"

Performance-based refresher training on critical tasks is conducted at least every 3 years.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Trainer Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because most contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel and/or Contractor safety personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Trainer Refinery conducts a PSSR for new facilities or facility modifications to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel who enter process areas, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure so that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system so that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Trainer Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, and other facility changes be reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes that are strictly procedural in nature are managed in a separate program.  All changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage and control any new hazards and (2) verify that existing safeguards have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, process and instrumentation diagrams, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.

The investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors when appropriate) who could be affected by the findings.  The results of the investigation are retained for at least 5 years so that they can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help the accident prevention program to function properly, the Trainer Refinery conducts periodic audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
