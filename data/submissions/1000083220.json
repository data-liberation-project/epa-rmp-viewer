SSI Food Services is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at SSI Food Services. \n\n\n\nIt is SSI Food Services' policy to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  To accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established safety programs that enable plant personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare plant personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\n\n\nThe SSI Food Services facility draws from decades of internal experience and expertise, as well as resources of CTI Foods to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the plant's safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).

The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is 83,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program in general starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected on a regular schedule depending on manufacturer and industry recommendations.  \n\n\n\nFor example, all compressors are inspected on a monthly basis for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings and sensor calibrations are performed every 6 months;  the condensers are inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure receiver oil pots are drained, pump pressures are recorded and pumps and valves are defrosted for excessive ice build-up;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating limit conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year preventative maintenance schedule.  Ammonia leak detectors are calibrated semi-annually and are located in the machinery room and in the pressure relief headers that trigger local audible and visual alarms for onsite operators.  Machinery room ventilation systems operate continuously and are designed for exhaust rates which exceed the emergency exhaust requirements.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed t"

To help coordinate the plan, a management program has been established as well as an internal audit program which will help identify the compliance status and possible deficiencies in the program.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a toxic release, an emergency response plan coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), rural fire department and trained company personnel has been written and implemented.  The ultimate goal for SSI Food Services' PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the industry.\n\n\n\nThe SSI Food Services ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. The SSI Food Services facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically outline requirements for the design and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the machinery room and relief headers, continuous automated ventilation, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, and emergency stop controls.  The majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located"

All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves (that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to protect the vessel's integrity) that discharge to common headers that are monitored by ammonia sensors.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the PHA Revalidation study performed on October 23-24, 2019, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the past five years (October 2014 - October 2019) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in 24 hours or that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History as specified above.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nContinued improvement for the ammonia refrigeration systems is a top priority for SSI Food Services LLC.
