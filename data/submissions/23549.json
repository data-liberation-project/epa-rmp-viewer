      "SummaryText": "Mt. Vernon Water Treatment Plant operates 24 hrs. day serving most of Rockcastle County. The plant is classified as a 4-A, with four certified operators. We produce 2 million gallons day from Lake Linville, our primary disifectant is chlorine. The plant on average feeds around 110 lbs of chlorine daily. Chlorine is used to kill any algea, bacteria, and pathogenes that may be present, and to have a safe gaurd out in the distibution system. The water plant stores, at any given time about 8000 lbs of chlorine in the chlorine storeage building that sets aside from the main operation building.The chlorine is packaged in one ton cylinders. We have two cylinders setting on a set of scales so we can keep the amount of chlorine beening feed recored down. The two cylinders are tied together with automatic vacuum switch, and manual shut off valves. The storeage building has in place chlorine detectors, exhaust vent,look in window before entry, one ton chlorine repair kit, light & exhaust switch located outside the building, boots, SCBA, and ammonia to help prevent any leaks.\n The plant has another cautious area this is called the injector room, it is located on first floor. The chlorine storage building is connected to the injector room with a service line running from the cylinders. This service line is connected, to two injectors. These injectors lets the operator control the feed rate. The injector room also has in place a detection system, look in window before entry, light & exhaust switch located outside the room. The plant also has in place a windsock located next to the storeage building & injector room. \n This RMP has two chlorine release scenerio's worst case & alternative case. The worst case is defined as the owner or operator shall asume that the maxium quantity is released as a gas over a 10 min. due to a unspecified failure. The alternative case is defined as more likely to occur.\nThe modeling was used from the EPA's RMP*COMP for both scenerio's. The worst case"

Only the population with in the plum extending downwind of the release piont is potenally affected. The meteorological condition namely stadility F, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, 77 degrees and a average humidity.\nThe alternative release occurs with a pipe leak with a release rate of 50 lbs min., duration of 10 minutes. The toxic endpoint is .3 miles estimated population of 25 residents. The meteorological  condition , stability class D, wind speed of 3 meters/second.\nThe operators are trained on the job once a year , and also attend seminar, training corses they can use toward renewal of certification. Training of community response personnel ; The Mt. Vernon Fire department are trained to the awareness level and 10% are trained to the operation level.\nIn case of a release, radio station WRVK 1460 AM will be utilized to notify residents whether to evacuate or stay indoors for the duration. this will depend on the size of release and the travel. Also police, fire personnel will go door to door to insure the evacuation of all effectedresidents. Schools and churces will be used as shelters if the necessity arise. The incident commander will autherize er-entry of the evacuated areas. \nThe E R plan has been reveiwed by the LEPC. Exercises must be conducted on a fpur year cycle. Functional exercises must be conducted during 3or 4 years, but a full scale exercise must be conducted during one year of the cycle. Local officals are encouraged to include hazardous materials promblems in the exercise.\nThey have not been no accident in the past five years."
