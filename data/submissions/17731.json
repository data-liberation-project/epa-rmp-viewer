All applicable procedures of 40 CFR\n68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health\nand response agency interaction.\nChlorine is used to disinfect treated wastewater before it is returned to the Ocmulgee River. \nChlorination processes include liquid chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment,\ninstrumentation, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.  \n\nThe accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine\npotential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine\nrelease.  The first \"worst case\" scenario, defined by the EPA, states that \"the owner or\noperator will assume that the . . . maximum quantity in the largest vessel . . . is released as a\ngas more than ten (10) minutes.\"  The \"alternative scenario\" is \"more likely to occur than\nthe worst-case release scenario.\"  The Lower Poplar Street WPCF has no accident history.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance\ntraveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical \"toxic\nendpoint.\"  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the\nmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals\ncould be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening\nhealth effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic\nendpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Lower Poplar Street WPCF involves a failu"
