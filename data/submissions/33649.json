This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeabley, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with emergency responders to provide highly trained emregency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nCapitol Wholesale Meats (the Facility) has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under both 40 CFR Part 68 and the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Facility's prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Facility maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses follow the HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years, or more frequently if necessary. Any findings related to each analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was completed on May 13, 2004.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to the covered process, the Facility maintains written operating procedures on site.

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to perators involved with the process.  The most recent review of operating procedures was completed on June 9, 2003.\n\nTraining\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating the process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.  The most recent review of training programs was completed on June 9, 2003.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by thse checks includes among others; storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance preactices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemical, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process condidtions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "ese reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits\nThe facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provsions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The most recent compliance audit was completed on June 9, 2003.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe facility promptly investigates any incident  that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe facility believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to both the PSM standard and RMP rule.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  The facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known poetential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental relase of a regulated substance occur.\n                                                                                                                                                    "
