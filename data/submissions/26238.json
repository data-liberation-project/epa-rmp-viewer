ACE stores up to 10,320 gallons (60,800 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia, an acutely hazardous material, on site at any given time.\n\nACE originally prepared a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) in 1991 pursuant to California regulations and has complied with Cal-OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Both of these programs are similar in most respects to the Clean Air Act RMP program.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nACE is committed to environmental compliance.  In addition to environment, health and safety (EH&S) policies and principles, ACE has also instituted a compliance assurance plan (CAP).  The CAP is a living compliance management document developed from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and ISO 140001 elements.  Through a system of schedules, monitoring regulatory requirements, audits, training, incentive/discipline programs, and record keeping, ACE ensures compliance and continuous improvement.\n\nThe ACE Cogeneration Company Environmental Policy Statement:\n\nACE Cogeneration Company is to conduct business in a manner that is lawful, compatible with the environment and conductive to the health and safety of employees, facilities and the community.\n\nACE Cogeneration Company Health and Safety Policy Statement:\n\nACE Cogeneration Company is to conduct business in a manner that is lawful and promotes the health and safety of employees, contractors, visitors and the community.\n\nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Principles:\n\nACE Cogeneration Company will conduct business consistent with the EH&S Policy and the following EH&S Principles:\n\n?

Successful compliance has been a result of adherence to the above programs and future compliance is anticipated based on this formula.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nACE owns a 118-megawatt (gross), coal-fired, circulating fluidized bed, cogeneration facility, referred to as the ACE Cogeneration Facility, in northwestern San Bernardino County.  ACE began operation in 1990.  A/C Power-ACE Operations personnel, under an Operation and Maintenance Agreement, perform the day-to-day operation.  ACE provides steam for IMC Chemical (IMCC) Company.\n\nAmmonia is used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions, which improves air quality.  The emissions control operations include storage and handling up to 10,320 gallons of anhydrous ammonia, a substance that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified as an acutely hazardous material.  The Federal and State of California governments have established a program for reducing the hazards associated with the storage and handling of such materials.  The program was initiated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Title III, Section 112(r) and codified in 40CFR Part 68.  The California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) pursuant to Sections 25531 through 25543.3 of the Health and Safety Code has additional regulations.

      "SummaryText": " Plan (RMP) for its anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facilities.  In an RMP, a facility reviews its processes, equipment and procedures in order to identify steps that could reduce the likelihood or consequences of a release of an acutely hazardous material.  ACE requested the assistance of Processes Unlimited in preparing the June 2002 RMP.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn RMP must consider the results of the following:\n\n1.    A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) that identifies the hazards associated with handling an AHM due to operating error, equipment failure, and external events that may present a risk of an accident involving an AHM.\n2.    An Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) that assumes pessimistic air dispersion parameters, and other adverse environmental conditions for the worst-case scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n\nA PHA revalidation was conducted at the ACE facility on January 29, 2002 for the RMP/PSM process, using the ?What-If? methodology.  The basic events, which could lead to potential off-site impacts, are corrosion failure, external event, and on-site accidents.  The worse-case and alternate release scenarios were developed from the PHA review.\n\nThe OCA requires analysis of two release scenarios: worst-case and an alternate release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario, according to the RMP Requirements, must consider a release that empties the content of the ammonia system in a ten-minute period.  This scenario does not take into account whether or not the release is probable.  The alternative release scenario is designed to investigate the worst-case release that could happen within the life time of the facility.  This scenario takes into account the combination of frequency and severity.\n\nThe maximum capacity of the ammonia storage tank is 12,000 gallons.  Written operating procedures and a high-level alarm prevent more than 10,320 gallons from being present in the 12,000-gallon tank, or 8"

      "SummaryText": "6 percent of maximum capacity.\n\nBoth the worst-case and alternate release scenarios were completed according to the EPA?s OCA Guidance using the Reference Tables.  The Reference Tables are tools used to determine the OCA and toxic endpoints required under the Risk Management Program rule published by the Environmental Protection Agency on July 20, 1996, which implements Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Both the OCA Guidance and Reference Tables are available to the public and can be downloaded from the EPA?s Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office web site at http://www.epa.gov/ceppo.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nCatastrophic release of ammonia from the storage tank.  This scenario is required by 40 CFR 68.  Although this scenario is unlikely, it involves releasing the entire contents of the storage tank within a ten-minute period.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nRelease of the entire contents of a 2-inch diameter ? 25? long hose from an ammonia cargo tank truck following a ?pull-away? incident at the unloading station.\n\nEVALUATION OF RISK\n\nThe most significant impact from an ammonia release would occur at the ACE Cogeneration Facility.  Anyone working outside within a few hundred yards of the release would be exposed to the highest concentrations for the worst-case scenario.  Personnel located inside buildings would be at less risk, since ammonia would enter these areas at a rate dependent on building ventilation rates.\n\nThe next most vulnerable area of impact would be the IMCC facility located to the south and east of the facility.  Again, those outside working would be most vulnerable, while those located indoors would be protected from the highest concentrations.\n\nThe worst case scenario off-site consequences extended the vulnerability zone to 2.8 miles from the facility.  The worst-case scenario would affect approximately 1,810 residential receptors in Searles Valley at a level above the CAAA Title III endpoint level of 220 PPM (Specific data"

Mitigation systems include dikes, a deluge system and a canopy.\n\nAdministrative controls include: health, safety and process training for all employees, contractors and visitors, procedures for different aspects of operation, record keeping, proper installation of equipment, regular inspection, ammonia truck off-loading procedures, storage tank/system operation procedures, ammonia injection procedures, repair and maintenance for all equipment using anhydrous ammonia.  Plant personnel supervise the deliver and off-loading of ammonia.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nACE complies with both the Federal/State RMP requirements, and Cal-OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR).
