This plan has been endorsed by the City staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant.  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine release.  All personnel involved in handling chlorine are trained with regard to chlorine safety and accident prevention.\n\n\u00a768.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the City of Columbus Parsons Avenue Water Plant Chlorination Facility.  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant has a design capacity of 50 million gallons per day (MGD) and treats ground water to drinking water standards.  Facilities are provided for the handling and utilization of chlorine in one-ton containers.  The Chlorination Facility is located in the Chlorine Room, adjacent to the Chemical Building, and includes a loading and unloading area, as well as a storage area for the one-ton containers.  \n\nThe chlorine ton containers are stored inside the Chlorine Room.  The doors and windows in these rooms are normally kept shut. A monorail and hoist assembly is provided for the handling and transfer of the one-ton containers to the storage facilities from open top delivery trucks or from storage to the scale assemblies for process use.   Provisions are made to house eighteen (18) one-ton containers of chlorine, twelve (12) of these are on trunnions on the floor of the Chlorine Room and the remaining six (6) are on scales.  Therefore the maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Parsons Avenue Water Plant is 18 full one-ton containers of chlorine or approximately 36,000 lbs of chlorine.\n\nThe Chlorine Room is equipped with six single ton container h"

Normally, all six containers are connected to the container mounted vacuum regulator check valves, with  only two of the one-ton containers in operation at a time, one for the pre- and one for the post chlorine feed points. When the in service container approaches empty, the container is shut off and the next full container in the bank is opened and put in service. \n\nThe plant is feeding chlorine as a gas under vacuum.  Vacuum chlorine feed reduces the likelihood of a release to the environment.  The chlorine gas is reduced to a vacuum of 20-25 inches of mercury at the container-mounted vacuum regulator check. The facility has two pairs of chlorinators, one designated for pre-chlorination, and the other designated for post-chlorination.  Four water injectors are provided for solution chlorine feed at various process locations.  \n \nThere are a total of 13 chlorine gas detector units in the plant.  There are 2 passive sensors in most chlorine gas detection units (cgdu).  The cgdu alarms at .5ppm. There are displays on each cgdu and a centrally located panel that indicates which sensor(s) have alarmed.  Alarm status and chlorine concentration are displayed on each cgdu.  The cgdu initiates the cgdu alarms (only local audio and visual) at each location and initiate the chlorine gas detector panel which automatically activates the scrubber system if a chlorine room alarm indicated.  Chlorine alarms trigger SCADA system alarms that notify Operations Staff, de-activates the non scrubber exhaust system and activates the appropriate sub-system alarm.  The chlorine room has two exhaust fans and three small air intakes located on the roof.  All exhaust fans are manually controlled by multiple push button stations.  Motorized louvers on the air intakes are automatically opened when the exhaust fans are started.  All non-scrubber exhaust fans are automatically inhibited and louvers closed when a Chlorine Room cgdu alarms.  \nThe basin complex, filter buil"

These prevention measures include elements such as Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  \n\n\u00a768.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other impacts. \n\n\u00a768.155(f) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant is a non-responding facility, as defined by OSHA and USEPA (29 CFR 1910.120 and 40 CFR part 311).  Therefore the Parsons Avenue Water Plant has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR 68.90(b).  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency and has coordinated this plan with City of Columbus Fire Department - Haz Mat Station 4.  The Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a chlorine emergency.   Parsons Avenue Water Plant employees are not designated responders to a chlorine release.  As specified in 40 CFR 68.90, Parsons Avenue Water Plant's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.\n\n\u00a768.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendatio"
