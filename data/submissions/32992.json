As part of this commitment, SENA has established procedures to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facilities.  SENA?s Wisconsin Rapids Pulp Mill (Pulp Mill) has developed a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and helps to manage the risks of the covered substances and processes.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at SENA?s Pulp Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn April 1967, SENA adopted a corporate environmental policy that guides the continuous improvement of its environmental performance as it strives to prevent pollution and achieve the objective of operating facilities with minimal environmental impact.  This policy was updated in November 1996.  The corporate environmental policy statement is publicly available on SENA?s Internet website.  As part of its risk reduction objective, SENA will strive to minimize environmental, health, and safety risks to its employees and the communities in which it operates by employing safe technologies and operating procedures.  SENA will be constantly prepared for emergencies.  SENA will continually inform its employees and public of its progress in safety and environmental issues.\n\nSENA is one of 26 Wisconsin paper companies voluntarily participating in the Wisconsin Paper Council's Pollution Prevention Partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  As part of this membership, SENA produces an annual report that illustrates SENA?s and the Wisconsin paper indu"

SENA?s Pollution Prevention Partnership Progress Report is available to the public.  SENA has also pledged to voluntarily align its corporate Environmental Management System to ISO 14001 international standards and to adhere to the American Forest and Paper Association's Environmental Health and Safety Principles.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSENA's parent company, Stora Enso Oyj, is domiciled in Finland. It is an integrated paper, packaging and forest products company producing publication and fine papers, packaging boards and wood products, areas in which the Group is a global market leader. Stora Enso's sales totalled EUR 12.2 billion in 2003, and has annual paper and board production capacity of about 15.7 million tonnes, and 7.4 million cubic meters of sawn wood products, including 2.8 million cubic meters of value-added products. Some 44,000 persons are employed in more than 40 countries in five continents. The company's shares are listed in Helsinki, New York and Stockholm.  \n\nStora Enso North America is a Division of Stora Enso Oyj. The Division is North America's leading producer of coated and supercalendered papers for the printing and publishing industries. In addition, Stora Enso North America is a premier producer of speciality papers, and manufactures coreboard products. The Division produces elemental chlorine-free kraft pulp, totally chlorine-free mechanical pulp and recycled pulp from printed, preconsumer and postconsumer scrap paper.  SENA has papermaking operations in Wisconsin Rapids, Stevens Point, Whiting, Kimberly, Niagara and Biron, Wisconsin; Duluth, Minnesota; and Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nThe kraft pulp bleaching process in the manufacture of kraft pulp involves chemically treating the wood pulp fibers to reduce or remove lignin and resin.

In late 1996, SENA eliminated elemental chlorine from its entire kraft (chemical) pulp-bleaching process, thus achieving the commonly referred-to position of elemental chlorine-free (ECF).  SENA?s mechanical pulps were already being bleached using a totally chlorine-free (TCF) process.\n\nChlorine dioxide and chlorine are the chemicals regulated by the RMP rule that are stored or handled at this facility in total quantities greater than or equal to the threshold quantities.  Chlorine dioxide is generated onsite as a gas under a slight vacuum and absorbed into water.  The chlorine dioxide liquid solution is stored in tanks and is used to bleach pulp.  The chlorine dioxide solution is stored in three vertical aboveground tanks with design capacities of 60,000 gallons, 60,000 gallons, and 103,000 gallons.  The chlorine dioxide solution has a concentration of 1% by weight of chlorine dioxide.  Thus, the total quantity of chlorine dioxide stored at the Pulp Mill is 18,609 lb.  The three chlorine dioxide tanks are partially located inside a building.  Chlorine is stored in nine aboveground cylinder tanks, each with a design capacity of one ton.  The total quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 18,000 lb.  The chlorine cylinders are kept inside a building.  Chlorine is a toxic gas liquefied by pressure in the cylinder and is used to treat process water.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of its corporate environmental policy, SENA will continue to protect the environment and the health and well-being of fellow employees and communities by monitoring existing facilities to ensure that they meet all legal requirements through the use of safe technologies and operating procedures.\n\nThe Pulp Mill complies with the prevention and emergency "

On July 3, 2002, chlorine dioxide escaped from an open valve for less than a minute.  One Pulp Mill employee suffered irritation to the eyes while responding to the leak.  No one offsite was injured.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Pulp Mill's emergency response program includes a written Emergency Response Plan that discusses procedures to be followed in the case of a general emergency and specific procedures for the handling of chlorine dioxide and chlorine spills to prevent and minimize the effects of an emergency involving these chemicals.\n\nThe Pulp Mill's current Emergency Response Plan works with the Incident Command System.  The Incident Command System is designed to provide both public and private sector emergency response personnel with a logical building block system for managing hazardous material emergencies.\n\nThe system is designed to begin at the point where emergency response personnel recognize that they are in fact, dealing with a hazardous material emergency, even when the exact hazardous material has not be identified.\n\nThe local fire department is also trained to the Incident Command System and will join with the Pulp Mill team members and co-command on an incident.\n\nThe Incident Command System identifies a chain of command in response situations.  It also identifies specific responsibilities for the various levels in that chain.
