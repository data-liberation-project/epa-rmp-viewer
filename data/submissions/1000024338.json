      "SummaryText": "e bulk storage tanks are built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code. The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are protected by concrete traffic barriers. All welding and structural work done on the tanks are performed by certified welders.\r\n\r\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented:\r\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input. Passive mitigation systems in place at the Munson location are: Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a railcar or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point. At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.  Active mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function. Active mitigation systems in place at Munson are: Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank. They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate. They wont re-open until the downstream shutoff valves are closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat. Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly. Back check valves are located on the railcar / truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only. This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a railcar or truck from the storage tank. Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great. This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer"

      "SummaryText": "Source and Product Description:\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Munson, MI location is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies. \r\n\r\nThe facility occupies approximately 2.5 acres and is situated just north of the village of Munson in Medina Township, Lenawee County. The facility is located on the east side of Munson Highway, north of Lawrence Street and south of the Norfolk Southern Railroad Line. There is one residence to the south of the facility, about 30 yards away. There are no adjacent neighbors to the east. There are a couple of homes on the north, about .25 miles away. To the southwest, there are 15 houses and one church within 500 yards of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Major Hazards:\r\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a railcar or delivery truck to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the storage tanks to the small application tanks (aka nurse wagons). Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly. Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed. All transfers of ammonia are observed by Wilbur-Ellis personnel.\r\n\r\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled. Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \r\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tanks can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s).  \r\n\r\nThe relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved. These events are very short in duration a few seconds at the most. \r\n\r\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely. Th"

Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump. This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve. An ample amount of water is available near the bulk storage tanks from 10,000 gallon and 15,000 gallon water tanks. A nearby water well (120' away) could be utilized to provide water to knock down a vapor cloud. Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers. Wilbur-Ellis company personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program. All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the spring and fall season. A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia. All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files. Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or related equipment are also on file.\r\nThis facility uses Paul Akers, Inc. an Indianapolis, Indiana firm, for welding and major maintenance performed on the tank. \r\n\r\nEquipment Maintenance\r\nAll equipment maintenance is formally documented. See the Prevention Program section for further explanation.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nAll employees receive required training on anhydrous ammonia, emergency action plan and spill procedures, and hazard communication. Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\nAll contractors receive a contractor safety review prior to performing work at the facility.
