This would have a considerable offsite impact as indicated in Section 2 of the RMP.  It must be stressed that a release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely.  Furthermore, mitigation factors such as chlorine monitors, remote isolation valves, video surveillance, and excess flow valves were discounted for this scenario.\n\nOur alternative release scenario assumes a fracture in the 1 liquid chlorine transfer line.   The basis for this simulation is a ten-minute release at a rate of 250 pounds per minute.  Safety drills have proven that, with the advantage of chlorine monitors and remote valve closure systems, it would take considerably less than ten minutes to stop the release.  Above a release rate of 250 pounds per minute, the excess flow valves on the railcars would immediately block the flow of chlorine.  To summarize the parameters for the alternative release scenario, we have:\n\na) 2500 lb. of chlorine released over a 10-minute period (250 lb./min.)\nb) The toxic endpoint of chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2 basis)\nc) 3.0 meters per second wind speed (based on EPA's model program guidance)\nd) Atmospheric Stability Class D (based on EPA's model program guidance)\ne) Ambient air temperature of 25xC\nf) 50% humidity\ng) Ground level release\nh) Urban topography\ni) No mitigation measures, other than those used to estimate release rate and duration as described above.\n\nThe estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.3 miles.  There are no public receptors or environmental receptors within this radius.\n\nAs part of our attempt to prevent accidental releases, Elementis Catalysts, Inc. complies with the following rules and regulations:\n* Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 (40 CFR 355), formerly known as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA Title III)\n* Occupational Safety"

The only regulated substance, liquid chlorine, is supplied to the process from a 90-ton railcar.  Thus, the maximum amount of chlorine in the process is 180,000 pounds.  \n\nIn accordance with the RMP regulation we have developed a worst-case scenario and an alternative release scenario to evaluate the offsite impact of significant accidental releases.  These scenarios were evaluated using the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Toxic endpoints were determined using RMP*Comp(tm) software provided by EPA, and offsite receptor reports were generated by Environmental Data Resources, Inc. \n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  It is simply assumed that the release takes place, without considering the possible cause or probability that such a release might occur.  Based on this guidance, our worst-case scenario uses the following parameters:\n\na) 180,000 lb. of chlorine released over a 10-minute period (18,000 lb./min)\nb) The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2 basis)\nc) 1.5 meters per second wind speed\nd) Atmospheric stability class F (stable)\ne) Ambient air temperature of 25xC\nf) 50% humidity\ng) Ground level release\nh) Urban topography\ni) No mitigation measures"

This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation was developed in response to public concern regarding the consequences that a catastrophic chemical release may have on surrounding communities and the environment. The Clean Air Act required EPA to develop the RMP in an effort to help prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of a release should one occur.\n\nWe have one regulated substance that is above the threshold quantities as specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore must comply with the RMP program. This program provides our facility with an integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazards posed by regulated substances. Under this program, our facility has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.\n\nIf after reading this program, you find that improvements can be made, please contact the safety and health manager, Robert Mikovitch.
