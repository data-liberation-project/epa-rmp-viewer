The facility operates using a state-of-the-art air emission control system that includes a  Selective Catalytic Reduction System (SCR) to control oxides of nitrogen. Anhydrous ammonia,  an RMP regulated substance, is an essential element used to convert oxides of nitrogen to elemental nitrogen. The part of the system subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  \r\n \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n \r\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Birchwood Power Facility is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program is the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility for the individual program elements. Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring Plant employee are adequately trained and tested in the RMP program elements; ensuring new equipment and modifications to the ammonia storage and dilution system are designed, constructed, operated and maintained by following facility-wide Management of Change Procedures, and observing Pre-startup Review and Hot Work Permit Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and conducting periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\r\n  \r\nThe RMP is also written to meet the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.

For example the ammonia tank is constructed with excess flow control valves designed to instantaneously stop a release of ammonia resulting from a tank piping failure and a water sprinkler system that would engage if the tank pressure goes above a predetermined set point. There are five ammonia detectors around and above the tank that alarm if a leak is detected. There is a water deluge system that can be remotely activated from the control room to absorb ammonia leaks around the tank. Ammonia flow to the dilution skid can be remotely shut off in the event of a pipe leak. The dilution skid is equipped with an ammonia monitor that automatically alarms if ammonia leaks into the boiler room.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia tank and dilution skid is maintained under an electronic preventative maintenance program that includes regular inspection of equipment and testing of critical components.\r\n \r\nThe facility provides training to new employees and refresher training to all employees.\r\n \r\nFive-year accident history \r\n\r\nThere have been no ammonia releases since startup of the facility in 1996.\r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program \r\n \r\nThe facility has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan which is used to respond to all anticipated emergencies. The plan covers the actions to be taken in the event of a personal injury, fire, natural disaster, civil disobedience,  and/or a release of petroleum products or chemicals including ammonia. Topics coved by the plan include evacuation procedures; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; employee coordination; notifying local emergency and medical response agencies so that they can notify the public as needed; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; government agency notification; incident investigation and corrective action procedures; emergency alarm system; annual emergency action training"
