      "SummaryText": "\nBAY COUNTY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, Panama City, FL 32404\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Bay County Utility Services to store, handle and use chlorine in such a manner as to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public and the employees at all times.  To achieve this policy, Bay County Risk Management developed Standard Operating and Emergency Procedures for the Use of Chlorine Gas Containers in September, 1994.  These procedures have been refined and updated several times since 1994.  The most recent update of these procedures is included in our RMP submission.\n\n\n\nAll of the Operators and Maintenance Mechanics along with their supervisors are HAZMAT Level III certified and trained to repair chlorine one-ton container leaks using the Chlorine Emergency Repair Level \"B\" Kit.  Since the Water Treatment Plant is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there are as a minimum, two trained personnel present and ready to respond to a chlorine alarm/leak. In addition, all field personnel that are based out of the Plant site are HAZMAT Level II certified.  This will save precious minutes while the Bay County HAZMAT Team and the other HAZMAT Level III trained Plant staff are activated to respond to the situation.\n\n\n\nBay County Utility Services has just recently completed the design for a major upgrade and expansion of the Water Treatment Plant and is currently soliciting bids prior to awarding a contract during the summer of 2004.  This project will take about 28 months to fully complete.  A part of this upgrade project is the conversion of the disinfection process from the use of gaseous chlorine to liquid sodium hypochlorite.  Once this switch has been made, then Bay County Utility Services will be able to de-register our facility from the Risk Management Program Rule.\n\n\n\nSee the Bay County Standard Operating and Emergency Procedures for the Use of Chlorine Gas Containers (included) for details on the day-to-day use of chlorine containers and response to minor and major "
