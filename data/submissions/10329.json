These regulations deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as wells as fire, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs are in place to prevent potential accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage.\n\nThese safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary.  All information is communicated to all employees of John Morrell, Springdale through training and documentation.\n\nJohn Morrell, Springdale is a meat processing, and packaging company which utilizes approximately 32,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping areas.  126,000 Pounds of propane are stored on-site as a backup to the Natural Gas for emergency use as a boiler fuel.

The vapor could travel as far as .09 miles.  This alternative release scenario was chosen because of its more probable likelihood that it could occur.
