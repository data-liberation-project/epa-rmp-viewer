There have been no changes to ownership of Abengoa Bioenergy of Indiana since the facility was constructed in 2009.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nAbengoa Bioenergy of Indiana has a commitment to worker and public safety. Abengoa Bioenergy\r\nof Indiana's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated\r\nsubstances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as\r\nnecessary according to Emergency Response Plans.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nAbengoa Bioenergy of Indiana ethanol plant is located near Mount Vernon, Posey County, Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol\r\nfrom corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program is Denaturant.\r\n\r\nAbengoa Bioenergy of Indiana has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.7 miles due to the amount of denaturant stored on site.\r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nThe worse case scenario at the facility is the release of all 749,874 pounds of denaturant.  The worse case endpoint is 0.7 miles from the center of the tank.  There are two businesses and one residence within the 0.7 miles.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Abengoa Bioenergy of Indiana has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to\r\nmanage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were\r\ntaken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nAbengoa Bioenergy of Indiana has not had any spills on site in the five years. The facility is subject to RMP\r\nupon delivery of substances onsite.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Abengoa Bioenergy of India"
