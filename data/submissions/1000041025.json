The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC are \n\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \n\nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \n\nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the \n\nmanagement plan in those meetings. The facility maintains an internal emergency \n\ncontingency plan.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work \n\nwith local fire departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize \n\nthe impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\n\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \n\nindustry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, \n\nhere after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, stored, and used in the \n\nproduction of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important source \n\nof Nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and fall of the year.\n\n \n\nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility is approximately 48,000 pounds.  The typical \n\nmethod of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds. The \n\ntransports are unloaded into the stationary storage tank.  A pump transfers the ammonia \n\nto the batch process. Batch process is not continuous but is operated intermittently. \n\n\n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n\n   \n\nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards  \n\nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \n\nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and \n\nmaintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Proce"
