      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a public generation and transmission company that provides power to almost 50 communities in Georgia.  The company has recently constructed a natural gas combined cycle combustion turbine facility at the existing Wansley Power Plant in Heard County, Georgia.  This new facility, called Wansley Unit 9, has been required by MEAG to develop and maintain site specific accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan.  The company is also requiring that the facility coordinate its emergency response plan with power plants located in close proximity.  Regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site are managed by MEAG and its facility operator.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nWansley Unit 9 is located south of Lowell, Georgia, close to the Northwest corner of Heard County.  Unit 9 consists of two natural gas fired combustion turbines each feeding a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems have been installed to decrease nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions that are produced by the turbines.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the SCR process to reduce the NOx  to nitrogen and water.  Wansley Unit 9 stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in two 15,000 gallon tanks for addition to the SCR process.  \n\nAlthough each ammonia tank has a total capacity of 15,000 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading Procedure limits the tank level to 85% of capacity, or a maximum inventory in each tank of 12,705 gallons.  The total process inventory of anhydrous ammonia is therefore 129,540 lbs. of ammonia, which exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nSince the RMP regulation requires that loss of chemical from the largest vessel be considered, this analysis involves the rupture of the storage tank, releasing 64,770 lbs. of ammonia over a t"

Using RMP*Comp to calculate the endpoint, the ammonia gas could travel 4.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L)\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of a break in the 2\u00bf charging line near the tank during charging operations.  It is assumed that the tank is 1/3 full and that due to the pressure drop between the storage vessel and the point of rupture, the liquid ammonia flashes and is released as a gas.  Using RMP* Comp and a release rate of 2,540 lbs/min, the ammonia gas could travel 0.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L).\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nThe RMP regulation requires classification of each process into a Program Level 1, 2, or 3 in order to determine the prevention program requirements.  Since the worst case release scenario would impact a public receptor, the process can not be classified as a Program 1.  Program 3 processes are ones that are not Program 1, but are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Standard , 29 CFR 1910.119, or one of the 10 NAICS codes listed in the RMP regulation.  The SCR process is covered by the PSM Standard and is therefore a Program 3 process.  The SCR process will use the PSM program which has been developed as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe PSM Program was established in the summer of 2003 for the new system prior to it being charged with ammonia.  The process is expected to begin operation in late 2003.  Wansley Unit 9\u00bfs PSM Program receives full support of plant management and includes involvement of employees and contractors who work on or near the SCR process.\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\u00bfEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis (PHA) is cond"

Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system. The written information includes the ammonia Material Safety Data Sheet and a description of the design of the SCR process.\n\u00bfProcess Hazard Analysis: Qualified plant personnel have conducted studies, using the What-If Technique, to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n\u00bfOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed to describe the steps that should be followed to safely operate the SCR process. \n\u00bfTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties that they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the SCR process. \n\u00bfContractors: All contractors are evaluated before they perform work on or near the SCR process. The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure safe work practices are followed. \n\u00bfPre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new  projects that affect the covered process to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been conducted, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. \n\u00bfMechanical Integrity. This program ensures that the SCR process is built and maintained using preventative maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\u00bfHot Work Permit: Procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning. \n\u00bfManagement of Change: The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the SCR process are properly reviewed.\n\u00bfIncident Investigation: The procedures ensure that any accidents and near misses are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team. \n\u00bfCompliance Audits: There are procedures to co"
