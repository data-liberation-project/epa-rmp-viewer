Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy at Bonduelle USA, Inc. - Bergen\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including associates that Bonduelle USA, Inc. is complying with OSHA'sProcess Safety Management Standards (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68 to manage the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to minimize the occurrence and consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  \n\nOverall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid\n\nphysical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\nOur safety programs show a commitment to safety and implimentation of safe procedures to minimize accidents as they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities or equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all associates at the facility.\n\n\n\n2. Regulated Substances Handled - (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\n\n\nThis facility is a frozen vegetable processing plant, which produces bulk frozen peas, various green beans, cut corn and carrots.  These vegetables are locally grown and transported to our facility for processing. The refrigeration process for freezing these vegatables involves the use of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The ammonia refrigeration process at this facility consists of various pumps,compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid in a closed system. The system operation is very similar to the operation of a household refrigerator.  We have three independent systems, with the largest system containing 40,393 pounds.  The other two systems contain 28,636 pounds and 4,286 pounds respectfully. The system that contains 4,286 pounds operates our cold storage warehouse. \n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed as required and they comply with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68.  The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\n\n\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n- Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n- Incident Investigation\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Hot Work Permit\n\n- Contractor Qualifications\n\n- Contractor Safety Program\n\n- Comprehensive Yearly Maintenance Program\n\n- Ammonia Detection System\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia to report over the past five years, that have resulted in a major or minor injury to an associate.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nBergen's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR .120)  We have trained associates for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  Our associates receive refresher training and physicals annually, paid for by the company. We conduct annual simulated release response drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with participation of the lo"

The facility currently has a 10 man trained response team consisting of current employees.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Bergen facility through a capital investment plan that emphsises continuous process improvement to upgrade our ammonia refrigeration equipment as needed. In 2014 all relief valves were recertified or replaced, our ammonia detection system was upgraded to alarm at 25 ppm as recommended. We have installed a new 200 HP compressor to replace an obsolete one. A 5 year Mechanical Interity Inspection was preformed in October of 2013 and completion of any recommendations is underway.\n\n  \n\n7. Worst and alternate release senerios submitted for 2014 RMP resubmission\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of pressurized anhydrous ammonia from the largest high pressure receiver located outside.  The selection of this vessel is consistent with Appendix E (Supplemental Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration) in the General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention which states that the worst-case release quantity is the greater of the following:\n\n\n\n?    The greatest amount held in a vessel taking into account the administrative controls on maximum quantity; or\n\n?    The greatest amount held in piping.\n\n\n\nSystem 1 in our refrigeration operations has 3 interconnecting vessels that hold a total of 40,393 lbs. This is our largest system thus chosen for the catastrophic release for the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\n  The following assumptions are made for the worst-case scenario\n\n\n\n?    Release of 4,000 pounds per minute for 10 minutes = 40,000 pounds released \n\n?    Wind speed of 1.5 meters/second\n\n?    Source height of 5 feet\n\n?    Air temperature of 77 degrees\n\n?
