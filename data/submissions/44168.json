      "SummaryText": "Schwan places a high priority on chemical safety.  The corporate environmental manager is assigned responsibility for ammonia refrigeration safety.  All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain 3-shift coverage of emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level.\n\nThis facility manufactures frozen pizza.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, with a system inventory of 390,000 pounds.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios are calculated sing RPM*comp and urban conditions.\n\nThe refrigeration system is covered by OSHA PSM rule, 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe facility has experienced 4 releases reportable under the EPCRA 304 rules.  None resulted in onsite or offsite casualties of offsite evacuations. \n\nThe emergency response team has about 50 members, all trained at the 24-hour technician level by the corporate environmental compliance manager.  Training emphasizes ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, protective equipment including use of level a suits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS).  Emergency plans are filed with the local fire department and annual walk-throughs are conducted with fire officers.  Pre-planned command posts and staging areas are designated and IC transfer and liaison protocols have been established.  Post incident de-briefings are conducted.\n\nSchwan continuous improvement process, a designated PSM team and post-incident reviews are to improve safety and emergency response."
