Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds one, two, four, or six bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Cold Storage Rooms and Pre-coolers. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows.

      "SummaryText": " To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\n \n\nIn the pumped overfeed system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each liquid recirculator. Each liquid recirculator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters each liquid recirculator. Low pressure liquid is pumped from each liquid recirculator to the bunker mounted and ceiling suspended evaporators located in the Cold Storage Rooms, Hallways, and Pre-coolers. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows.

As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\n\n \n\nSafety Systems\n\nThe ammonia detection system is displayed and controlled inside the machinery room and pump room. There are three ammonia sensors installed at Sun Pacific Lerdo. Two (2) ammonia detectors are installed inside the machinery room, and one (1) inside the pump room. \n\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) roof-mounted ventilation fans that are continuously running that can be used to reduce the ammonia concentration inside the room in an emergency. The emergency ventilation system can be controlled manually by the ON/OFF switch located on the machinery room roof, or the emergency break glass switch outside the principal machinery room door.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) was installed in accordance with the Fire Code at the time of construction. The ECB is installed on the east wall of the machinery room and contains three (3) valves.\n\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #3: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\n\nOpening Valve #1 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #2 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #3 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system.\n\n \n\nThe Emergency Control Box is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment from high and low pressure.\n\n\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with pressure relief"

      "SummaryText": " valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. The relief valves on the high side of the system relieve at 250 or 300 psig while the low side of the system relieves at 150 psig. Accumulators 15 and 21-29 relief valves are equipped with a rupture disc and non-resetting gauge to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. The rupture discs are installed upstream of each relief valve and are designed to break at the relief valve set pressure. Once the rupture disc gauge has been broken, the gauge needle will move to the \"burst\" zone, indicating that the relief valve has lifted. The gauges can be manually reset. All pressure relief valves are piped to the ammonia diffusion tank sized according to the Uniform Mechanical Code at the time of construction. This tank helps mitigate many of the hazards associated with the release of ammonia through a pressure relief valve.\n\n\n\nThe liquid recirculators and main suction accumulator are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\n\n\nProcess Classification\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sun Pacific Lerdo consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
