Per the LEPC, one Risk Management Plan was prepared for the facilities.  In 2006, Apio Cooling developed their own independent refrigeration system.  This submittal represents Curation Foods as an independent, stand-alone ammonia refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nA. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nCuration Foods located in Guadalupe, California, utilizes refrigeration for ice making and cold storage. Senior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. A majority of the ammonia equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\nCuration Foods has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the Santa Barbara County.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Curation Foods to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. Curation Foods response team will mitigate incidental releases up to the IDLH. Curation Foods does not enter an IDLH atmosphere.\r\n\r\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Curation Foods facility is located at 4595 W.

In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cooling and storage of vegetables.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 15 psig to 30 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 125 to 150 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP);\r\n\u00bf\tOSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \r\n\r\nAdministrative Measures:\r\n\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia  Refrigeration Tie ins\"\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\r\n\u00bf       IIAR 6 \"Standard for Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration systems\"\r\n\r\nThe Curations Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.

For example, the Curations Foods facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\r\n\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: two emergency shutdown switches (located outside the engine room exit door and in the office) that stop electrical power to all engine room equipment with the exception of the exhaust fans, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and ventilation fans in the engine room which start automatically when the ammonia level or temperature in the engine room exceed designated setpoints.\r\n\r\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (January 2012 - January 2017) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \r\n\r\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action/Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tsave lives;\r\n\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\r\n\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\r\n\u00bf\tminimize prop"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  \r\n\r\nCurations Foods personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Operations Manager. The Operations Manager and or Maintenance Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\r\n\r\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed on 10/22/2021 at the Curations Foods facility. This study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Curations Foods facility located in Guadalupe, California.  In addition a compliance and 5 yr mechanical audits were completed in 2021. The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Curations Foods safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year and one half, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include but are not limited to the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Update the emergency response plan to include additional details for rescue, active shooter and decontamination\r\n2.
