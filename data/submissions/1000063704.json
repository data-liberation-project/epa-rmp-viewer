Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunview Cold Storage - Pond has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Sunview Cold Storage - Pond, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sunview Cold Storage - Pond has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration         Anhydrous Ammonia                17,000\r\n \r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Nevertheless, Sunview Cold Storage - Pond continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sunview Cold Storage - Pond's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sunview Cold Storage - Pond's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage - Pond has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sunview Cold Storage - Pond has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Sunview Cold Storage - Pond now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and initiate an auto-dialer. Also, Room 3, Room 9, Room 10, and Room 11 are equipped with a standalone ammonia detector that is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and initiate an auto-dialer.\r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed on the south exterior wall of Precool 6, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sunview Cold Storage - Pond consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage - Pond has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sunview Cold Storage - Pond facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage - Pond has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage - Pond's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release.
