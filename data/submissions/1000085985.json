The Hobbs Fractionation Complex has several regulated flammables. These are present at Site both in pure form and in mixtures. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n1. Process Safety Information - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure the safe operation of the covered processes. SDS (Safety Data Sheets) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled in the site.  Engineering design documents include the safe operating parameters, design basis operating paramete"

Process Hazard Analysis - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex performs and updates risk assessments of the covered processes to ensure systematic identification and control of process hazards.  These risk evaluations include off-site consequences as well as possible environment consequence and public impact.  The What-If/Checklist analysis technique along with the Layer of Protection (LOPA) Analysis technique are used to perform these hazards evaluations. \n\n3. Operating Procedures - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains key process parameter documents or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n4. Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, Hobbs Fractionation Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refreshe"

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n5. Mechanical Integrity - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  These activities make up a system that maintains the integrity of the process equipment.\n\n6. Management of Change (MOC) - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex utilizes a change management tool to ensure proper reviews are conducted, hazards are assessed, and a safe operation environment is maintained during and after the introduction of a change in the covered processes.  Each MOC (permanent or temporary) includes a risk assessment to identify potential hazards of a change such as (1) process equipment, (2) chemicals, (4) technology (including process operating conditions), and other facility changes.  The MOC system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.  Approval and action items are tracked in the MOC application.\n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex conducts a PSSR for any new or modified facility that requires a change in the process safety information. This review confirms that (1) proper equipment is used, (2) that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a risk assessment is conducted and (4) training has been implemented.

Compliance Audits - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex performs PSM and RMP compliance audits at least every three (3) years. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.\n\n9. Incident Investigation - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex investigates all incidents that reasonably could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n10. Employee Participation - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees "

The teams typically have members from operations, maintenance and plant management.\n\n11. Safe Work Practices - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hobbs Fractionation Complex is coordinated with the Gaines County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and Industry representatives.  The Hobbs Fractionation Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an Incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic lEPC meetings, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe Site has had one accidental release as defined by the RMP regulation in the past 5 years.
