The What-If/Checklist analysis technique along with the Layer of Protection (LOPA) Analysis technique are used to perform these hazards evaluations. \r\n3. Operating Procedures - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\nIn addition, the Hobbs Fractionation Complex maintains key process parameter documents or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n4. Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, Hobbs Fractionation Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refreshe"

Compliance Audits - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex performs PSM and RMP compliance audits at least every three (3) years. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.\r\n9. Incident Investigation - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex investigates all incidents that reasonably could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n10. Employee Participation - The Hobbs Fractionation Complex encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.
