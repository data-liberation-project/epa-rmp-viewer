Flexsys has an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that establishes clear expectations for immediate response for spills/ other hazardous scenarios of concern. \r\n\r\n(b) STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \r\n\r\nFlexsys has one chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2), that meets the toxic chemicals TQs, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program for its use within the process. CS2 is used as a solvent within the process. \r\n\r\n (c) ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.  \r\nFlexsys had been diligent in its completion of the Program 3 Prevention Program requirements that help safeguard the public from accidental releases by:\r\n- Process safety information:  Flexsys compiled written process safety information that is completed prior to conducting any process hazard analysis required by the rule.  This written information enables Flexsys and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances.  Minimum information includes hazards data such as that found on a Safety Data Sheet, technology information, and equipment information.\r\n- Process hazard analysis:  A detailed hazard evaluation has been performed by an experienced team to ide"

The what-if/checklist methodologies were used for determining and evaluating the hazards of the process.  The analysis addressed the hazards of the process. The PHA process requires the review of any previous incident which had a potential for catastrophic consequences. Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards are evaluated and recommendations created if needed. Controls include early warning detections that provide early warning of release. Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, stationary source siting, human factors, and qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls are assessed.  These analyses are being updated and revalidated on a five-year basis.\r\n - Operating procedures:  Written procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety information.  Elements that are addressed include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain a process.  These procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure they represent current operating practice.  In addition, safe work practices, applicable to employees and contractor employees, are developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during a variety of plant operations.\r\n - Training:  Initial and refresher training is conducted as appropriate for each employee involved in operating a process.  Flexsys establishes and documents that each employee has received and understood the required training.\r\n - Mechanical Integrity:  Flexsys has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity program that applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, pip"

Safety improvements to process equipment and operating procedures are planned to prevent the accidental release of CS2 for the safety of our employees and the community.

The procedures assure that the technical basis for the proposed change, the impact of the change on the environment, safety, and health, the modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change are all addressed.  Appropriate employees and contractors are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process of affected part of the process.
