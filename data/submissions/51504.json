We willingly observe the stringent industry safety precautions to prevent hazards in the workplace. City management and water operations staff have instituted procedures to ensure a safe working environment is maintained which emphas proper handling and containment of hazardous materials. The City's safety planning also emphas the prevention of the release of toxic substances into the environment. In the unlikely event of a release, the plan also identifies in-house and community-based expertise which will be called upon to minimize the impact to the community.\n\n     The current Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located 3 miles southwest of the core of Hermiston at the intersection of OR Hwy 207 and W. Feedville Rd in Umatilla County, Oregon. Disinfection of the water being treated is accomplished through chlorination with chlorine gas. The WTP falls under EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations due to the storage and use of chlorine gas for diinfection. The WTP currently stores 3 tons of chlorine in pressurized, one-ton containers.\n\n     No accidents associated with the storage of chlorine gas at the WTP facility have occurred since it's construction in 1995. An extensive Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) of the worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario has been performed with the aid of the EPA's RMP*CompO and EPA guidance documentation. The following is a brief description of the OCA results.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nQuantity Release:                    2000 lbs\n\nRelease Rate:                          200.0 lbs\n\nRelease Duration:                     10.0 min\n\nWind Speed:                            1.5 m/sec\n\nAtmospheric Stability Class       F\n\nTopography:                             Rural\n\n\n\nDistance to Endpoint:                2.2 mile"

The City provides extensive training for all employees who work on the chlorination precess, including emphasis on stringent procedures for maintaining the integrity of the chlorination equipment. The WTP is continuously monitored for potential hazards that could affect the chlorination process. When a potential problem is identified, it is corrected as quickly as possible. There have been numerous changes and upgrades implemented to the original chlorination process since the WTP was built in 1995, including the addition of audible/visual alarms, wind sock, alarms for chlorine detectors to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)system.

In-place safety plans will take every precaution so that any future change deemed necessary will be correctly designed, constructed, and operated.\n\n\n\n     The City of Hermiston has created a focused Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that will be followed in the event of an accidental release of chlorine at the WTP. Employees are trained in the procedures of this EAP to ensure it's policies are quickly and effectively implemented in an emergency. Coordination with Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services and the Oregon State Regional Hazmat Team constitutes significant elements of this EAP. The regional Hazmat Team 10 team is based out of Hermiston.\n\n\n\n     We believe the outstanding safety record of the City of Hermiston and the WTP related to chlorine gas will continue. The City's focus will continue to be maintenance of a safe working environment for it's employees and protection of the community."
