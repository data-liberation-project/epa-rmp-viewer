All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAEP - Rockport Power Plant is located in Rockport, IN. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a supply system for emissions reduction. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, AEP - Rockport Power Plant has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nAEP - Rockport Power Plant facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the storage system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The tank area is provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The storage system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the storage system. In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the Spencer County LEPC to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as\n\nrequired.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nThis facility has procedures in place to respon"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAEP - Rockport Power Plant expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of the PSM/RMP program. All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia storage process. AEP - Rockport Power Plant expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
