The six (6) elements or core values of Brenntag Cornerstone are: SAFETY FIRST, LEADERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY, EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND OWNERSHIP, COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WORLD CLASS VALUE CREATION.  As stated by Mr. William A. Filder, President & CEO of Brenntag North America and Latin America; \"Nothing we do can ever become more important than our safety performance.\" and \"There is not business goal worth asking people to sacrifice what they value most in life.\"  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with ORLANDO FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Orlando facility's primary activities include the repackaging and distribution of chemical products.  We have three (3) regulated substances present at the Orlando facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine is received into Orlando in 180,000 pound railcars.  Chlorine is repackaged in different  containers and used to produce bleach (sodium hypochlorite)for distribution to our customers.  The Sulfur Dioxide containers are packaged at our Henderson, KY facility and are stored"
