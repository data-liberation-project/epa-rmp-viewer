Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nWe at Solvay USA, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances, and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\n\n \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe University Park, IL facility's manufactures chemical specialties such as amides, amidoamines, imidazolines, preservatives, blends, and other surfactants and specialty chemicals. These products are used in the production of various commercial and industrial chemicals as well as in the HPC market. The facility utilizes one chemical, Epichlorohydrin, above the threshold quantity of the EPA Risk Management Program; thus, this substance is regulated under the EPA RMP regulations. \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for the Solvay USA, Inc. University Park facility in accordance with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following briefly describe the elements of the release prevention programs that are in place at the facility. \n\n\n\n4. Process Safety Information \n\nSolvay USA, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes. \n\n\n\n5. Process Hazard Analysis \n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled. The methodology currently being utiliz"

The analyses are performed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process, and equipment operations. The safety studies are revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\n6. Operating Procedures \n\nThe facility maintains written procedures which address safety specific to the operating equipment and product manufacturing processes. These procedures are controlled to ensure that the current version is readily available to operators involved in the processes. The procedures address various modes of operation, such as normal operations, startup, shutdown, and emergency shutdown. The procedures are reviewed and updated at a minimum, annually. \n\n\n\n7. Training \n\nThe facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the procedures associated with the manufacturing processes and equipment for which the employees are responsible. Refresher training is provided periodically. Training on safe handling, use, and hazards of the raw materials and products is conducted regularly. \n\n\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program \n\nThe facility has a formal documented Mechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program. Regularly scheduled maintenance checks ensure reliability of process equipment. Process equipment covered by the program includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls, pumps, and interlocks. Qualified contractors complete some periodic inspections and tests. Other inspections and tests are carried out by qualified plant personnel with training in maintenance practices. Plant personnel are provided specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by inspections and test are corrected in a timely manner. \n\n\n\n9. Managemen"

The most recent revision of the management of change procedure was issued in June 2019. Process operators, maintenance personnel, and any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions or process equipment are promptly made aware of and provided training to address the modifications. \n\n\n\n10. Pre-startup Safety Reviews \n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes, modifications in established processes, and return-to-service after maintenance work are conducted as a regular practice at the University Park facility. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to returning the equipment to operation. \n\n\n\n11. Compliance Audits \n\nSolvay USA, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the regulations are properly implemented at the University Park facility. Corrective actions identified as a result of these audits are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n12. Incident Investigation \n\nThe facility investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could feasibly result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are completed to identify the root causes that lead to the incident as well as any corrective actions that should be completed to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n\n\n13. Employee Participation \n\nAt the University Park facility, Process Safety Management and accidental release prevention are a team effort. Plant personnel are strongly encouraged to express their views and concerns related to all aspects of Personal Safety, Process Safety, Accident Prevention, and other general issues. Plant personnel are strongly encouraged to recommend improvements and s"

Employees have access to all information created as a part of the facility's implementation of the EPA RMP rules, including the process hazard analyses. \n\n\n\n14. Contractors \n\nThe facility utilizes contractors on a regular basis to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. A safety performance evaluation of each contractor is conducted prior to selection for work on the site. Contractors are notified and informed of known potential hazards related to the work they will be performing and the processes in their work area. Contractors are informed of emergency response procedures in the event that there is an accidental release or a regulated substance. \n\n\n\n15. Five-year Accident History \n\nThe University Park facility has a record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our release prevention policies, during the last five years, there have been no accidental releases of RMP covered chemicals meeting the definition of a release that would require reporting in the updated RMP. \n\n\n\n16. Emergency Response Plan \n\nThe University Park facility has a formal written emergency response plan to deal with accidental release of hazardous materials and other incidents. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response related to adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning of the site's emergency response equipment regular inspections and tests are conducted. Training is conducted and the emergency response plan is updated to reflect any applicable modifications to equipment and manufacturing processes which would result in a different response. In the event of an accidental release, the site would involve the Will County Local Office of Emergency.\n\n\n\n17. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe site continually"
