      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: We at Genpak, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Charlotte Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled: The facility manufactures disposable food trays. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is n-butane. N-Butane is actually a mixture of n-butane (95%) and isobutane (5%). In this document, the mixture is referred to as n-butane. The regulated substance at our facility, n-butane, is used for adding fluff in the making of polystyrene food trays and containers. The maximum inventory of n-butane at our facility is 110,000 lb. The n-butane is stored in a 30,000 gallon (110,000 pounds max) tank filled to a maximum of 87% capacity and in a 23,000 gallon (84,000 lbs max) railcar. These are not connected except during refilling of the storage tank. The railcar is only present on site when the storage tank requires refilling. Therefore, 110,000 lbs is the maximum inventory. \n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario: To perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and the model EPA Comp.

      "SummaryText": "s of the chosen scenarios. \n\n-The worst case release scenario submitted for flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the storage tank in the n-butane process. The scenario involves the release of 110,000 lb. of n-butane from the storage tank. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \n\n-The alternative release scenario submitted involves a release from the n-butane distribution line due to a break in the distribution hose during filling of the tank. The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion. The scenario involves the release of 1,000 lb. of n-butane in 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.04 miles. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Our facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This n-butane system was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard. The n-butane process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Genpak, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a what if analyses. The s"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures: For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Genpak, LLC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining: Genpak, LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity: Genpak, LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. \n\nMaintenance: Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations involving the regulated process. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change: Written procedures are in place at Genpak, LLC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews: Pre-start up safety rev"
