      "SummaryText": "North Central Texas Municipal Water Authority (NCTMWA) utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant at its water treatment plant (WTP).  NCTMWA has a maximum of 3 one ton cylinders of chlorine on hand at a time.  A chemical release could only consist of a cylinder rupture which would allow the complete contents of a cylinder to be released into the atmosphere.  The alternative scenario would be if a leak occurred in the piping connections at the cylinders in which the WTP operator on duty would turn the manual shutoff at the cylinder to prevent the complete contents of the cylinder from escaping into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nNCTMWA employs 7 full time WTP operators.  There are a maximum of 4 employees at the WTP site at a time.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 residences located around Miller Creek Reservoir within 3.1 miles of the WTP, which is distance to the endpoint for the worst case scenario.  None of these residences are occupied full time, but are weekend/vacation residences for recreation by the owners at the lake.\n\n\n\nNCTMWA has not had an incident involving the release of chlorine gas into the atmosphere within the past 5 years."
