      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nZenith Sintered Products, Inc. is committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at their facility.  Zenith Sintered Products' policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in order to 1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, 2) reduce the threat to employees' health, and 3) reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used, the training of personnel, and the manner in which an accidental release is handled.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nZenith Sintered Products utilizes anhydrous ammonia at the facility for heat treating as part of the sintering process.  The anhydrous ammonia is dissociated through the use of heat and a catalytic reaction, forming nitrogen and hydrogen gases.  The hydrogen is utilized as a heat source at the furnace, and the nitrogen is used as a blanketing mechanism at the furnace as a barrier to unwanted contaminants.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in two 8,000 gallon tanks.  The tanks are not filled to greater than 82% capacity.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release\nZenith Sintered Products used the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis\" to determine the worst-case release scenario.  Standard operating procedures limit the filling of each vessel to no greater than 82% of capacity.  Failure of one of the 8,000 gallon tanks filled to 82% capacity would release 3,060 pounds per minute for ten minutes.  The scenario assumes a wind speed of 1.5 m/s, stability class F, and urban terrain.  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm is 2.0 miles.  No passive mitigation was considered in determining the worst-case release.\n\nAlternative Scenario\nZenith Sintered Products used the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis\" to calculate an alternative release scenar"

      "SummaryText": "io.  Zenith Sintered Products chose a two-inch diameter hole in one of the storage tanks which could release 7,550 pounds per minute.  The scenario assumes a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, stability class D, and urban terrain.  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm is 0.5 mile.  No passive or active mitigation were considered.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nZenith Sintered Products complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard as well as all applicable state codes and regulations.  Properly trained Zenith Sintered Products' employees conduct daily and weekly inspections and maintenance activities on the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nZenith Sintered Products implements an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  Employees receive training on an annual basis.  The facility will notify the fire department in the event of an emergency.  The Waukesha County LEPC has developed an Off-Site Plan to address a release of ammonia at the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nZenith Sintered Products believes that safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Improvements to the program will be made as necessary or as the opportunity arises."
