Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at the Hobbs Gas Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release were to occur, we are completely coordinated with the Hobbs Fire Department, which provides trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is the operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  The regulated substances at our facility are components of the natural gas feed to the plant, the extracted liquid product, and the residue natural gas.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Methane at our facility is 56,000 lb, while Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] are present at our facility in quantities of 58,000 lb, 48,000 lb, 16,000 lb, 8,500 lb, 7,400 lb and 6,700 lb, respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.

      "SummaryText": " of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the \"Gas Plant and Associated Operations\" process.  The scenario involves the release of 109,680 lb of a flammable mixture containing Pentane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane, and Ethane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.38 miles is obtained, corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the \"Gas Plant and Associated Operations\" process.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 37,721 lb of a flammable mixture containing Pentane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane, and Ethane.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.18 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  The Hobbs Gas Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) (29 CFR 1910.119).    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Hobbs Gas Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to "

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on May 14, 1996.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Hobbs Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Hobbs Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Hobbs Gas Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on January 28, 1999.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten proc"

The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed on December 10, 1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification.  They are also given any training required to safely deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Hobbs Gas Plant.
