              "Description": "8.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2, SUBPART C\n\nThe Geocycle prevention program covers both Processes  \n\nThe Geocycle Hazardous Waste Derived Fuels (HWDF) systems and feed to the Holcim cement kiln, related utility and safety systems are subject to the requirements of EPA's Prevention Program Level 2.  \n\nGeocycle has developed and implemented seven elements required by Prevention Program Level 2:\n\n1.    Safety Information            68.48\n\n2.    Hazard Review                    68.50\n\n3.    Operating Procedures            68.52\n\n4.    Training                68.54\n\n5.    Compliance Audits            68.58\n\n6.    Incident Investigation            68.60\n\n7.    Maintenance                68.56\n\n\n\n7.1.    SAFETY INFORMATION    68.48\n\nGeocycle compiled the safety information required under the RMP regulations.  The safety information assists in the understanding of the safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, and the limitations placed on the operations and the adopted codes and standards.  First, Geocycle receives hazardous waste and uses a detailed chemical analysis and physical property analysis to define each waste stream.  There are no MSDS or SDSs for hazardous waste.   Next, the bulk containers used for delivering the waste fuel containing the RMP compounds are DOT-specification containers and are required to be tested periodically for tightness and adequacy for carrying hazardous materials.  Documentation of the safety and design information on the typical process equipment, along with the corresponding design codes, is maintained in the plant's current RCRA Permit Application in Section4 - Storage and Process Information (4.3 Hazardous Waste Management), Operations SOPs for Operating Limits and Temporary Operations, Engineering and Maintenance Records.  The 2011/2012 EPD audit report and equipment evaluation confirmed all of the equipment installations were within code.  The information contained on the Safety Information Sheet is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis for completeness and accuracy.  The maximum intended inventory for each RMP Toxic Chemical is listed in the List of Chemicals in Table #1 and #2..  \n\n\n\n7.2.    HAZARD REVIEW    68.50\n\nThe facility completed several hazard reviews (HR) of its RMP regulated process (HWDF) facility operations. A Hazard Review was conducted on October 31, 2014 of the improvements to the Vapor Recovery System and a Hazard Review was conducted on March 24, 2015 of the expansion of the Sprinkler System in the Receiving areas. A Hazard Review was conducted on December 17, 18, and 19, 2012 of the RMP regulated process.  In 2011 a complete explosibility and electrical systems review was completed.  Then in September 2009, a Hazard Review and audit of the blend tanks and derived fuel system was conducted. Again in January  2008 for the Direct Burn Process and September 2006,and Management of Change Review, February 6, 2007 for the Blend Tank Process (update to the initial HR performed in June 2001 and December 1999). the HR used a structured \"what-if\" for the most of the evaluations. The more complete Hazards and Operability (HazOp) technique  was used for the 2011 review.  Each HR used a multidisciplinary team to conduct the evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe HR identified:\n\n7.2.1.    Hazards associated with the process and regulated chemicals\n\n7.2.2.    Potential for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause a release\n\n7.2.3.    Safeguards that control the hazards or prevent the malfunction or error\n\n7.2.4.    Steps to detect or monitor releases\n\nThe HR results have been documented and are retained on file at the facility.  Implementation of the HR recommendations is ongoing and essentially a continuing process.  The Hazard Review shall be updated minimally every 5 years or with any process or equipment change that occurs that impacts the covered processes. \n\n\n\n7.3.    OPERATING PROCEDURES    68.52\n\nGeocycle has written operating procedures (OPs) that describe in detail what tasks a process operator must perform.  The OPs set safe process operating parameters that must be maintained.  It lists the set safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  These procedures are the guide for employees on how to work safely, providing a readily accessible source of comprehensive information that can prevent or mitigate the effects of an accident.  Finally it provides workers and management with a standard against which to assess performance.\n\n\n\nGeocycle must have written operating procedures for each of the following:\n\n7.3.1.    Initial start-up\n\n7.3.2.    Normal operations\n\n7.3.3.    Temporary operations\n\n7.3.4.    Emergency shutdown\n\n7.3.5.    Emergency operations\n\n7.3.6.    Normal shutdown\n\n7.3.7.    Start up following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change\n\n7.3.8.    Consequence of deviation and steps required to avoid or correct deviations and\n\n7.3.9.    Equipment inspection\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures shall be updated any time there is a change in the process in a way that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Examples of changes that may require an update to the operating procedures include:   the installation of new operating equipment, a change in the safety information for the regulated chemical or process equipment, as well as the identification of additional hazards during the updates to the facility hazard review.\n\n\n\n7.4.    TRAINING    68.54\n\nUnder the RMP regulation in 40 CFR Part 68.54, all new workers and experienced workers are trained in the Operating Procedures prior to starting working on an RMP covered process.  Also, training is given any time the procedures are revised as everyone must be trained in using the new procedures.  Training for the RMP program is given at least once every three years  Finally, training will be given more often if necessary, employees will be consulted by Geocycle to establish a refresher training regimen.  Refresher training is provided on the operating procedures even if they have not changed.  The training must cover all parts of the operating procedures, including information on the consequences of deviations and steps needed to address deviations. \n\n\n\nUnder the provisions of 40 CFR ? 68.54(c), the facility \"may use training conducted under Federal or state regulations or under industry specific standards or codes or training conducted by covered process equipment vendors to demonstrate compliance with this section to the extent that the training meets the requirements of this section\".  Under the prevailing federal RCRA regulations, all HWDF facility and cement plant employees associated with hazardous waste operations are trained within 6 months of hire.  The training includes the following:\n\n24 Hours initial RCRA/MSHA hazardous waste operations and emergency training  \n\n8 hours RCRA/MSHA annual refresher training\n\nClassroom and on-the-job training is conducted, along with written examinations as required.  All training logs and records are maintained on site.\n\n\n\n7.5.    MAINTENANCE    68.56\n\nPreventive maintenance, inspection, and testing of equipment are critical to safe operations.  Geocycle has developed and implemented procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment.. We also train applicable workers and contractors in the maintenance procedures, under 40 CFR 68.52, 54 and 56. \n\nAs required under 40 CFR 264/265, the facility has implemented Procedures to Prevent Hazards  as an integral part of its hazardous waste management operations.  These written procedures meet or exceed the requirements for preventive maintenance, inspection and testing under the RMP regulations and are incorporated by reference.  They provide a detailed list of the equipment to be tested and the inspection frequency.  The schedules already in practice are based on: \n\n7.5.1.    Regulatory Compliance Requirements\n\n7.5.2.    Manufacturer's Recommendations\n\n7.5.3.    Industry Standards or Codes\n\n7.5.4.    Good Engineering Practices\n\nAll employees associated with preventive maintenance, inspection and testing are trained in these procedures.\n\n\n\n7.6.    COMPLIANCE AUDITS     68.58\n\nGeocycle will review and audit the RMP Plan every three years, at a minimum, to ensure that the plan is implemented and documented adequately.  The audit program is designed to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of the Risk Management Program and ensure that the prevention program elements are up-to-date and appropriate for current operations.\n\n\n\nThe compliance audit will be conducted every by an individual (or team); knowledgeable of both the regulated processes as well as the RMP regulations [40 CFR Part 68].  The compliance audit will include a review of all elements of the RMP plan level 2 program, including:\n\n7.6.1.    Safety Information\n\n7.6.2.    Hazard Review\n\n7.6.3.    Change in Regulated Process or Regulated Chemicals\n\n7.6.4.    Records\n\n\n\nUpon completion of the compliance audit, all findings shall be summarized in a written report.  Geocycle will promptly determine and document an appropriate response to each audit finding and further document all corrective actions taken to address any deficiencies.  Copies of the two most recent compliance audits and documentation of all corrective actions will be maintained at the facility.  A copy of the blank audit form used by South Carolina DHEC is included in Appendix 7.\n\n\n\n7.7.    Incident Investigation    68.60\n\nGeocycle will perform an investigation of each incident which has resulted in, or could have resulted in a release or catastrophic release of a regulated chemical.  A catastrophic release is one that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.  An RMP reportable release is one that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nThe following steps will be taken in performing an incident investigation:\n\n7.7.1.    Initiate an investigation as promptly as possible, as but no later than 48 hours following the incident.\n\n7.7.2.    Summarize the investigation in a report.  Incorporate all factors contributing to the incident including:  date of incident; date investigation began, a description of the incident; the factors that contributed to the incident; and any recommendations resulting from the investigation.\n\n7.7.3.    Address the investigation findings and recommendations.  Resolutions and corrective actions shall be documented.\n\n7.7.4.    The findings shall be reviewed with all affected personnel to prevent future occurrence of similar incidents\n\n7.7.5.    Each investigation report is maintained for a minimum of five years.\n\n",

All results are maintained on site and included in the RMP Submit program.  \n\n3.1.1.    Worst Case (c) (1)\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed for each flammable and toxic chemical using the EPA's RMP-COMP program.  \n\n3.1.2.    Alternative Case (c) (2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 100-gallon-per-minute leak in a tank, pump, pipe or associated storage and transfer equipment.  Modeling was performed using the EPA's RMP COMP program based on duration of 60 minutes, which is a conservative assumption.\n\n\n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE LEVEL 2 PREVENTION PROGRAM (C)\n\nThe Geocycle accidental release prevention program is based on EPA's RMP Level 2 prevention program.  Also, Geocycle HWDF policies and procedures meets RCRA requirements for a permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility and MSHA safety standards therefore the plant is exempt from OSHA standards.  \n\n\n\n4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (C) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written program's elements is listed below:\n\n4.1.1.    Process safety information for chemicals and equipment.  Note all chemicals are waste streams and thus a list of chemicals within a waste stream is certified by the waste supplier.  Geocycle also uses the SDSs for the pure constituents as a guide to the hazards presented.\n\n4.1.2.    A hazards review policy and reports.\n\n4.1.3.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\n\nOn November 2, 2015 - 7:30 PM; the Material Handler was splashed with a non-RCRA/ non-RMP liquid fuel and sustained an injury.  He was in the process of unhooking the hose from the tanker truck which should not have had any pressure on it.  He opened and closed an inlet valve to the pump thinking he had relieved all the pressure in the unloading hose. In doing so, he closed the valve leading into the pump rather than closing the valve on top of the pump.  When he unhooked the hose from the tanker truck it blew off pressure spraying no more than 20 gallons of the non-RCRA/non-RMP liquid fuel on his body and face, the tanker truck, and the surrounding building walls and floor.  All was contained in the unloading area containment system.  He immediately went to the local eyewash and safety shower and flushed his eyes and skin.  We had him visit a Doctor to evaluate the exposure which resulted in the Material Handler receiving a prescription for eye drops to heal the irritation in his eyes.  The Material Handler was released back to full duty after one day of restricted duty; no lost time from work resulted from this incident.  Based on the incident investigation team report, full face respirators are to be used for unhooking and hooking up hoses to tanker trucks and rail cars.
