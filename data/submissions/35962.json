The company's Searles Valley facilities, tap into one of the richest sources of diversified minerals and chemicals on earth ? the location contains 98 of the world's 110 known chemical elements.  Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \n\nA unique liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) process for manufacturing boric acid has been operated at the Facility since 1962.  An organic extractant was developed and patented for use in this process.  The boric acid process is based on the ability of the organic extractant to form a compound with certain boron compounds found in the Searles Lake brines to form a compound that has very specific properties.  \n\nBoric acid production consists of 2 processes: liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) and evaporation-crystallization.  The liquid-liquid extraction process consists of 2 sections:\n1.    A loading section where boron, sodium and potassium are extracted from the lake brine, and combined into the organic extractant used in the LLX Plant. \n2.    A stripping section where the boron, sodium and potassium are stripped from the organic extractant by contact with a dilute acidic aqueous solution to form an aqueous solution of boric acid and sodium and potassium sulfates (called the strip solution), and to regenerate the extractant for re-contact with Lake Brine.\n\nIn the evaporation-crystallization section the dilute aqueous strip solution is evaporated and the boric acid is separated from the mixed sulfates by fractional crystallization.\n\nDescription of Regulat"

P20 is produced in the P20 Plant (at the Trona Facility) and it can be described as a 50% weight solution of specific phenolic compounds in a kerosene base.  The purpose of P20 is to provide the raw material for making the extractant utilized at the LLX plant.\n\nChlorine (a regulated substances) alongwith other raw materials is used in the manufacture of the P20 Product (as such a separate RMP has been submitted for the Searles Valley Minerals Trona Facility).  One ton containers of chlorine are stored at the Lake Operations Chlorine Storage Facility for eventual transport to- and use at- the Trona Facility.  Up to a maximum of ten one-ton containers of chlorine may be stored at the Lake Operations Chlorine Facility at any one time.  These containers are stored on a double row set of rails (on a concrete slab) at ground level and protected from rolling by chocks.  A roof over the slab provides the containers protection from solar heating.  The Chlorine Storage Facility is located in an isolated and unpopulated location along Oscar Johnson Road on Searles Valley Minerals?s Lake Property.  The only activity conducted at the Chlorine Storage Facility is the storage and handling of one-ton chlorine containers (as received from the chlorine vendor).  No connections are made to the chlorine containers are made at this location.\n\nSearles Valley Minerals personnel pick up containers with a crane and a special handling device (certified spanner bar), place them on a licensed transport trailer equipped with a cradle and mechanical restraints and deliver the containers to the Trona Facility (at the P20 Plant).  The site has been used for the storage of one-ton chlorine containers for over 20-years.\n\nSite Security\nA chain link fence prohibits unauthorized entry or access t"

These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to specific areas including those areas where chlorine is stored and handled, thus adding a level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the site.\n\nES 2.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n?    the worst case release; and\n?    an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\nCHLORINE\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nIn this scenario, one of the ten one-ton containers of chlorine stored at the Chlorine Storage Facility experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the Chlorine Storage Facility where the one ton containers are located/stored).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case).  The release of chlorine would occur outdoors.  Thus, it was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident form a cloud of chlorine vapor which is free to migrate off-site.

These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Chlorine Storage Facility, a pinhole leak in one of the chlorine containers that develops some time after delivery and acceptance of the container or a variety of transportation accidents involving a chlorine container during either delivery to the Chlorine Storage Facility or delivery from the Chlorine Storage Facility to the Trona Facility.  In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 2000-pounds of chlorine gas were released during an event in which the valve on one of the containers is sheared off due to some unknown external event.  The resulting cloud of chlorine vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.  Utilizing the BREEZE DEGADIS PLUS MODEL, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 1.3-miles.\n\nES 3.0    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update (i.e., from June 21, 1999 through June 21, 2004), the Facility has NOT had any releases of chlorine that have resulted in:\n?
