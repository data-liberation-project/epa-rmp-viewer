      "SummaryText": "Parslow Trucking Inc., dba Parslow Products has a retail anhydrous ammonia facility at Hansboro, North Dakota.  Hansboro is a very small town of a population of approximately 18.  Our facility/plant has approximately 40 nurse tanks that are currently used and two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  In 1996 we requested our first inspection from the Department of Ag & Boiler Inspector of ND.  Our plant continues being inspected every 5 years by an official from the ND Dept of Agriculture.  The last inspection was on September 10, 2019 as in compliance with: the ND Century Code 4.1-38, the Agriculture Commissioners enforcement of chemical accident prevention provisions of RMP outlined in 40 Code of Federal Register (CFR) part of 68 under the Clean Air Act. Our employees attend annual Fertilizer Facility Safety, Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) Handler Training and Product Transportation Meetings put on by the ND Dept of Ag; and/or employee training is also done through videos and by hands on job safety training. There is a community an emergency evacuation plan in response to an incident of a worse-case ammonia leak occurring.  We have been in business since 1977 years without any major ammonia incidents.  We are concerned with agriculture, public safety, employee/customer safety and awareness that all comes together for anhydrous ammonia to helping to grow food to feed our nation."
