Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\n \n\nLineage Logistics has a long standing commitment to worker, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Vernon 1-3, is a facility run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics - Compliance Department that includes; Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nLineage Logistics - Vernon 1-3 is located at 3141 East 44th Street, Vernon-California.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly commercial and industrial area.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Vernon 1-3, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA PSM and EPA Program 3.\n\n\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements include:\n\n?Process Saf"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of ?68.42(a), the owner or operator shall submit as part of the RMP the information required by Section ?68.42(b) on each accident covered by section ?68.42(a).\n\n\n\n\"The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"\n\nLineage Logistics - Vernon 1-3 has had no releases in the last five years (May 29, 2014 - May 29, 2019) that meets the five-year accident history reporting criteria, therefore no data is required. \n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics - Vernon 1-3, has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place to properly prepare for emergency evacuations, to provide first aid and medical treatment and to contact federal, state and local officials in the event of a major release of ammonia. The Facility Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local responding units, such as the local fire department or HAZMAT Team. \n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include:\n\n?A Process Hazard Analysis, which was performed in April 29, 2019.\n\n?A Hazard Assessment, which performed April 24, 2019.\n\n?A 5 Year Mechanical Integrity Audit, which was performed in April 1, 2019\n\n?A Compliance audit, which was performed in February 28, 2018.\n\n\n\nAny outstanding recommendations from these studies, including the target completion date and/"
