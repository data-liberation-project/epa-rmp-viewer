      "SummaryText": "This facility is subject to the EPA's SPCC regulation (40 CFR 112.7) and the release prevention procedures are discussed in more detail in the facility SPCC plan. Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate the facility.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from various field wells. Separated natural gas undergoes a chilling process to strip out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 42,000-gallon pressurized bullet tank, which is located approximately 0.5 mi south of the main facility. Administrative controls are implemented at the facility which limit the total volumes to 33,000 gallons in the pressurized bullet tank. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.\n\nThe NGL products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, and propane. For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL).\n\nThe facility has not experienced an incident as defined by the regulations within the past 5 years.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required. The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required. Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate the facility.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
