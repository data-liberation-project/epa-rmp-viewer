      "SummaryText": "COMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nMozel  is a wholesale chemical packager and distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  We supply the automotive, coatings, ink, adhesives, sealants, plastics and  many other key industries with chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nMozel's parent company, Univar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome products stored and handled by Mozel are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n Prevention Program\n\nAll Univar USA Inc. facilities that handle hazardous substances comply with stringent Operating Standards and Health, Safety & Environmental Employee Training Programs.  Univar has documented the operating and safety procedures in the Operations Standards Manual and in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, the Process Safety Manual includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazards Analysis\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Management of Change\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Hot Work Permits\n?    Contractors\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Columbia site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to industrial and wholesale customers.  Prepackaged containers of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) are handled at inventory levels above the RMP planning thresholds.  The typical inventory level forTDI is 20,000 lbs.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario for the site would involve a total 55 gallon drum failure with the rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase of 550 lbs of Toluene Diisocyanate, according to the EPA prescribed release protocol.  This would result in a release of 550 lbs of TDI in a 1 minute time period.  USEPA's RMP COMP air dispersion model projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 0.6 miles.    \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAn alternative release scenario was also developed for the site using EPA prescribed protocol and conducting air dispersion modeling with RMP COMP.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for Toluene Diisocyanate would involve a 550 lb drum leak releasing 55 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Mozel is subject to Program Level 2 prevention requirements under RMP.  Some of the chemical specific prevention steps at the Columiba site include the following:\n\n1.  The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2.  Employee training and operating procedures.\n3.  Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4.  Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines.\n5.  Inside storage in contained rooms equiped with sprinkler and foam fire suppression systes.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Columbia site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the containerized storage of toluene diisocyante in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nMozel has an Emergency Contingency Plan in-place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to Mozel facility personnel.  Mozel responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.  Mozel invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with our products and facilities."
