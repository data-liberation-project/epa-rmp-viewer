If a release should occur, we are prepared to work with local fire departments, medical agencies and law enforcement to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION  - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  We also blend dry bulk fertilizer for sale and custom application to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and sold to farmers for fertilizer for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored at our location would be 80,000 # in one storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled at any one time would be the unloading of a transport of 45,000 #.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 # from one storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to the endpoint is.83 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential release is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be 5000 # in a 2 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint is .28 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - The facility has excess flow valves, relief valves and manual shutoff valves in place to help prevent accidental releases.  We have also implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility also has training and safety meetings on a regular basis.\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  We have also provided state and l"

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nButch Gilbert\nPlant Manager"
