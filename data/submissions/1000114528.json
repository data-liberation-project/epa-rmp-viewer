Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Waseca, Minnesota (Original Plant) - Frozen Foods facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are coordinated with the Waseca Fire Department and the Waseca County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility processing plant used for food manufacturing and packaging of vegetable products (i.e., peas & corn).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media associated with Warehouse #3\u0092s closed-looped ammonia refrigeration system. \n\nA majority of the site has been decommissioned, including some of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  Currently only Warehouse #3 Ammonia Refrigeration System remains active. Even though the quantity of anhydrous ammonia remaining on site is approximately 7,500 lbs., due to the hazardous nature of ammonia we have decided to continue managing the system as being covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n \n3.
