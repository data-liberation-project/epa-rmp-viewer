FRUIT CO., REEDLEY FACILITY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees The Giumarra Co. is preparing a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program to comply with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Program Level 3 Elements, and Federally Title 40 CFR Part 68) and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program is being prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program will promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program will enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our program incorporates and brings together several existing safety programs which already set forth rules, procedures and practices which help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nWe operate a Commercial Cold Storage of deciduous tree fruit - apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, grapes, persimmons and kiwi fruit.  We store all of our packed product in cold storage.  Our facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms, some equipped with blast tunnels for cooling fruit.  Each cold room is equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  High pressure liquid from our main receiver is "

      "SummaryText": "piped to each cold room, where it passes through a liquid feed valve to the low pressure refrigerated area.  Low temperature and pressure gas from the coils is returned to our engine room, where it passes through a compressor.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a evaporative heat exchanger where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Giumarra Co. is an integral part of the overall business.  It has a system charge of approximately 58,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system/process is constantly being monitored by our refrigeration engineer.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment.   The system/process is controlled by a computer which monitors many process variables, and allows remote control.  In the event of a system upset the computer actuates a dialing program that alerts key personnel and responders.  We have ammonia detectors which also trigger alerts.  The detectors are inspected weekly and serviced annually.  Our evaporator coils are also equipped with water defrost, which can be used to absorb released ammonia.  Water containing ammonia would be held in an onsite holding pond.\n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an ac"

      "SummaryText": "cidental release of ammonia through monthly safety meetings.  During these meetings we also discuss the preventative measures to take, such as evacuation, in order to not be affected by a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 \"Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\"  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves.  These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to overpressurization.\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Giumarra Co. facility at Reedley has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans\" and Federally Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" and Federally Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond Defensively to a release. Our engineer has received Defensive Training (First Responder, Operations Level) specific for ammonia response and meeting HAZWOPER criteria.  Under this plan our employees will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. Initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place before the end of the year.  The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment.  Steps might include stopping the flow of ammonia to a leak point, or using the compressor"

All response activities would be coordinated with the local fire department and the Visalia Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release.  We have two (2) windsocks at our facility that employees can use to determine the \"upwind\" side of any point of release.  \n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAs of June 21, 1999, the time that this Executive Summary is being submitted, our Risk & Process Safety Management Plan is not complete.  The reason is that in order to do it right a lot of work must be done.  We simply do not have enough qualified employees or resources to meet the initial deadline. Our company operates seasonally and we have found that our ability to allocate managerial and operator resources to prepare this plan depends upon our workload.  In addition, we have found it necessary to obtain help from outside vendors for some critical elements, such as preparing Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and conducting a Process Hazard Analysis.  These vendors are attempting to meet the requests of numerous facilities such as ours at the same time, and have the same problem of only a limited number of people qualified to carry out the required tasks.  Thus, these vendors are setting completion dates for plan elements that we cannot entirely control.\n\nHowever, we have prepared the following milestones and allotted times for the completion of our plan:\n\nMilestone Allotted Time\n* Conduct Offsite Consequence Analysis - Done\n* Prepare RMP*Submit showing status as of 6/21/99 -Done\n* Collect Process Safety Information - Done\n* Conduct Process Hazard Analysis - On or around Oct 1, 1999\n* Finish PHA documentation including Action List 30 days - By Nov 1"
