This includes the West Water Treatment Plant located at 300 South 49th Street and the East Water Treatment Plant located at 111 South 1st Street.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergencyu Response Policy - Water staff is trained in safe chlorine operation and handling procedures and is able to respond to minor leaks.  Staff also performs monthly maintenance and safety checks on the chlorination equipment,  chlorine scrubber and leak detection systems.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of Norfolk Fire Division and Elkhorn Valley LEPC, which will notify any potential affected residents in the area.  Chem Trec is contacted by the City to perform the HazMat duties.\n\n2.  Regulated Substance - The East Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant.  We have one-one ton chlorine cylinder on line at all times and will have one additional one ton cylinder on hand at any given time for a total of two-one ton cylinders on site.\n\n3.  Worse Case Scenario - A possible broken cylinder valve on a one ton chlorine cylinder will release chlorine and can travel a distance of 1.3 miles.  If this type of leakage would occur we would activate the emergency response team to protect the residents in the affected area.  Next step would be to notify Chem Trec response team.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History - We have not had any accidental releases in the last five years using one ton chlorine cylinders.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program - Our emergency response is to utilize an on-site chlorine scrubber which is activated when a chlorine leak is detected and is able to consume a one ton chlorine cylinder within 25 minutes.  Water Treatment staff is also trained and ready to respond to chlorine leaks by activation of the emergency plan, which includes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division which activates the Local"
