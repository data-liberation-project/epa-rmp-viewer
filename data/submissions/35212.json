We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n*Comply with all applicable laws, regulations and standards.\n*Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental improvements.\n\nOur complete Health, Safety & Environmental policy statement, signed by our Plant Manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility.\n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protect the environment. Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner. This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program. To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and the experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly form the Plant Manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n2.

The foam buns are fabricated into spools, rolls, and other specialty parts. Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA?s risk management rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck; it is stored in four tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can stored at this facility is 420,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nSafety information\nHazard reviews of our processes\nOperator  procedures\nTraining\nEquipment Maintenance Program\nRMP Compliance Audits\nAccident/ Incident Investigation\nContractor Training\nHot Work Permit\nProcess Equipment Change\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn addition, we have established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines the hazards of handling Toluene Diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce the hazards of Isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community and the environment. Process controls also exist to minimize potential releases (e.g. tank level gauges, high level alarms, high-pressure switches, bursting disk, and system interlocks).\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

Five-year accident history\n\nIn the previous 5 years, the following reportable accidents have occurred at the Woodbridge, Chattanooga facility.\n8/18/03 Incident involving TDI resulting in an onsite employee exposure. After unloading a railcar of TDI the employee was exposed to TDI due to improper hose disconnection. The employee was disciplined for not following proper procedures. The procedures were subsequently modified to improve the clarity of the unload hose connection, disconnection, and PPE requirements. All certified operators were retrained on the procedure modification.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. We have coordinated our program with local emergency planning committee and the fire department. The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department all have copies of an MSDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits our plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\n\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release. The following responses are addressed in our plan:\n*Proper notifications in the event of a release (internal and external).\n*Systematic shutdown of operations.\n*Evacuation of personnel.\n*First Aid procedures.\n*Emergency response team actions.\n*Decontamination of personnel and equipment.\n*Management of waste material\n*Start up of operations.\n*Accident/Incident Investigations.\n\n\n6.
