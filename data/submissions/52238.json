The facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage and it is the policy of Ford Motor Company Sharonville Transmission Plant to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local Laws.  In the event of an emergency concerning the propane tank, and associated processes, it is our policy to notify the Sharonville City Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.  The plant maintains fire team to respond to small minor incidents and coordinates with the local emergency responders.  In addition, the Plants minimize the risks associated with their propane systems by:\n\n1. Development and implementation of a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in compliance with OSHA?s PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119)\n\n2. Planning and training for response to an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]\n\n\n\nSharonville Plant is an automotive transmission manufacturing facility, which produces transmissions for Ford Motor Company. \n\n\n\nThe storage and dispensing of propane at Sharonville is limited to one 12,000-gallon liquid propane storage tank and its associated dispensing systems.  The capacity of the storage tank is limited by administrative controls to 85 percent by volume or 42,450 pounds. The propane is used in the vacuum carburizing processes, and associated thermal oxidizer, within the manufacturing building\n\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios [40 CFR 68.155(c)]\n\n\n\nAs required by EPA guidance, the worst-case releases were determined for the release of the entire contents of the storage tank at the Sharonville Plant, followed by a vapor cloud explosion. \n\n\n\n To determine the amount of propane released in the worst-case scenario, Sharonville considered the administrative control on the capacity of the sto"

This endpoint extends beyond the Sharonville Plant property line.  There are no residential areas within the end point.  Sharonville minimizes the possibility of this type of release from occurring through the accidental release prevention program that we have established.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a facility present information on one alternative release scenario analysis to represent all flammable substances held above the threshold quantity. A number of alternative release scenarios were identified at Sharonville.  The one that appears to be the most useful is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a release of propane when a hose fails during filling.  The distance to the endpoint was calculated to be 0.02 miles.  The distance to the endpoint for this scenario does not extend off-site and there are no public receptors.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\n\n\n\nSharonville complies with the EPA?s accident prevention rules, the OSHA PSM standard, and all the applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane process is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  In addition, Sharonville has developed and use routine maintenance and operational controls to prevent accidents.  Specific prevention steps are listed in the Sharonville Plant Emergency Response Plan and the PSM Plan.  Specifically, Process Safety Information, Operating Procedures, Pre-Start-up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Contractors, and Management of Change contribute to safe operation of the process.\n\n\n\nThe established work practices for the propane process at Sharonville outline the methods of transferring propane from the delivery vessel to the storage tank and storing propane that minimize releases.  They also outline the process for the safe operation of the carburiz"

This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plant.  The most recent PHA conducted by the plant identified no deficiencies in the propane system.  The PHA did not identify an impending release of propane based on the operation or maintenance of the propane system.\n\n\n\nAs described in the Training section of the PSM document, each employee with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling or use of propane is thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the propane-related procedures relevant to their responsibilities.  Employee Participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM Plan at Sharonville.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History [40 CFR 68.155(e)]\n\n\n\nSharonville has never had an accident involving propane that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program [40 CFR 68.155(f)]\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the propane system, it is the policy of this facility to notify the Sharonville Fire Department and request assistance.  In addition, the facility has personnel and a fire team to respond to minor incidents involving propane, and coordinates the emergency response plans with the Sharonville Fire Department. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety [40 CFR 68.155(g)]\n\n\n\nAfter consideration of the identified release scenarios, the accident history, and a review of the latest inspection reports for the propane systems at Sharonville, no changes to the system are deemed necessary by the plant. \n\n\n\n"
