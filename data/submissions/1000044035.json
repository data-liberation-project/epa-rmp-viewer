Wilbur-Ellis Company, Willows is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Willows staff is trained and utilize equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, for safely storing anhydrous ammonia, conducting anhydrous mixing operations to produce aqueous ammonia, and storing and distributing aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Willows has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Conversion System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Willows policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Willows is located at 6504 County Road 57, Willows, California in the county of Glenn. The primary activity at the Facility is the conversion of anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia, storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia used for conversion is received, stored, and used in the production of aqueous ammonia, which is distributed as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000 gallon storage tank (bullet) and one 15,000 gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 154,242 pounds.\r\n\r\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 125,000 gallon above ground tanks at t"

The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24% active ingredient by weight, is 425,400 pounds. \r\n\r\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \r\n\r\n-Risk Considerations\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\r\n   -The history of the Wilbur-Ellis Company, Willows (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Willows to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\n\r\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 154,242 lbs.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM.  The 500 lbs state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Pro"

As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 and EPA RMP Program Level 3. \r\n\r\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n\r\n   -Process Safety Information\r\n   -Process Hazard Analysis\r\n   -Operating Procedures\r\n   -Training\r\n   -Mechanical Integrity\r\n   -Management of Change\r\n   -Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n   -Compliance Audits\r\n   -Incident Investigation\r\n   -Employee Participation\r\n   -Hot Work Permit\r\n   -Contractors\r\n\r\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan. See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\r\n\r\nThe facility's maximum storage of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 425,400 lb.  Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lbs threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Wilbur-Ellis Company, Willows is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 24% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantity of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%. For the reasons mentioned above, the Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and EPA RMP Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Prevention Program 2 elements include:\r\n\r\n   -Safety Information\r\n   -Hazard Review\r\n   -Operating Procedures\r\n   -Training\r\n   -Maintenance\r\n   -Compliance Audits\r\n   -Incident Investigation\r\n\r\n5.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements. To improve the safety of the ammonia system, Wilbur Ellis is in the process of developing a more comprehensive anhydrous ammonia inspection checklist for the bullet tank system and nurse tanks. The comprehensive checklist will include daily, weekly, and annual inspection frequencies, including visual and non-destructive tests to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks, valves, piping, etc. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry standards. Wilbur-Ellis is also implementing a facility wide comprehensive corrective action/preventative action (CAPA) log to track and facilitate completion of listed CAs on a timely basis. Recommended improvements and identified deficiencies from the  inspection checklists, compliance audits, and PHA studies will be included on the facility CAPA log along with the priority, employee responsible, and targeted completion dates. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the June 4th, 2009 PHA Report. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by December 2009.\r\n\r\n9.
