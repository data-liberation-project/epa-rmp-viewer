              "Description": "PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe purpose of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to ensure that written information is compiled for all Scott covered processes.  This compilation of information is designed to enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in processes utilizing ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, or nitric oxide.  The PSI documents are as follows:\n\n1. The hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide;\n2. Technical information on the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems; and \n3. Design information on the process equipment.\n\nPSI activities are required under the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (Cal/OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard Title 8, Section 5189(D) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).\nSummary of Scott Process Safety Information Requirements\nWritten PSI, documenting the information discussed below, is to be compiled for each covered process at the facility; in this instance, these are the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems.\n1. Material hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide are to be identified, including:\n          Toxicity\n          Permissible exposure limits\n          Physical data\n          Thermal and chemical stability data\n          Reactivity data\n          Corrosivity data\n[Note:  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) may be adequate to comply with this requirement.]\n\n2. The technical bases of designs for the covered systems are to be documented, including:\n         The process chemistry\n     Maximum intended system inventory\n     Safe upper and lower operating limits for system items such as temperatures, pressures, flows, or compositions \n     An evaluation of the consequences of system operation deviation,                including those affecting the safety and health of employees\n\n3. Equipment design basis for the each system is to be documented, including:\n     Materials of construction \n     Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) \n     Electrical classification\n     Relief system design and design basis\n     Ventilation system design\n     Safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection or suppression systems)\n     Design codes and standards that were used in the design\n\nWritten PSI is to be compiled before conducting a PHA on a covered process.  This information forms the basis for identifying and understanding the potential hazards associated with a covered process.  The information is also essential for thorough completion of other RMP activities, such as Management of Change, Operating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations.\nThe PSI shall be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Safety Information Overview\nScott believes that complete and accurate written information concerning each RMP chemical, each RMP chemical process technology, and each RMP chemical process equipment is essential to an effective RMP Program.  \nThe purpose of the PSI Program is as follows:\n    To enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the hazards involved with the RMP chemicals;\n    To provide information for a complete and thorough PHA; \n    To support other RMP activities, such as Management of Change \nOperating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations; \n    To provide information on the hazards involved with ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide to Scott employees and contractors; and to document that the covered process systems are designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nToxic Gas Monitoring\nThe H Building, the enclosed areas in the H Building, the laboratory and the B Building are monitored with toxic gas monitors.  An MDA 7100 monitor, two MDA CM4 monitors, two System 16 monitors that continuously sample the air for hydrides, mineral acids, corrosives and chlorine.  A System 57 monitors the Laboratory also ammonia and flammables in the H bldg. These monitors will detect levels of ammonia, arsine, Boron trichlouride, chlorine, hydrogen and Nitric Oxide at different alarm levels\n\nFire Protection\nThe H Building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  The system was installed and is maintained in accordance with Uniform Fire Code requirements.\n\nOther Process Safety Information\nThe following information is contained in the Standard Operating Procedures:\n    Safe upper and lower limits for major process parameters;\n    Consequences of deviation from established safe limits; and\n    Safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.  Because the systems are covered by the RMP standard, an initial PHA must be performed and recertified every 5 years.\n\nConducting the Process Hazard Analysis\nFor each ?What-if? question raised by the study team during the meetings, the team identified the current potential hazards, their consequences, severity, and likelihood of occurrence, as well as recommendations to reduce, eliminate, or control the hazards.  If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\nThe PHA addressed the following issues:\n1.   The potential hazards of the process.\n2.   The identification of any previous incidents that had a likely potential for consequences in the workplace.\n3.   Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the potential hazards.\n4.   Potential consequences in the event of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\nPHAs are required only for Program 3 covered processes.  PHAs were also conducted for the Program 2 covered processes (in lieu of simpler hazard reviews) due to the similarity of the processes and the ease of maintaining the PHA teams.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.

If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\n\nProgram 3 Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures for Program 3 covered processes must be available for the arsine and nitric oxide processes and must address the following elements:\n1. Steps for each operating phase:\n    Initial startup\n    Normal operations\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n2. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n3. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n    Precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n4. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n5. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n\nScott Operating Procedures\nAll ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide process operations at the Scott Fremont facility are governed, to some degree, by written Operating Procedures.  These Operating Procedures include guidance from the manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the specific process equipment.  All Operating Procedures have been and are developed through detailed discussion with operating personnel, who are considered a useful resource for practical job safety information.\nOperating Procedures are updated as necessary whenever there is a change in a covered process.  The Safety Manager oversees the development and revision of the Operating Procedures when process change occurs.  The Production Manual contains the most recent control versions of specific Operating Procedures.\nCurrent Operating Procedures are distributed to and maintained in the production area.  They are used as the basis for all new and updated operator training.  Operators and other personnel who could have an impact on the safety of covered processes, such as contractors, are trained on any revisions to Operating Procedures before changes are implemented.\n\nTRAINING\nProgram 3 Training Requirements\nEach employee involved in operating a Program 3 covered process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.  The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazard, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.\nRefresher training is required at least once every 3 years, or at any time the procedures are revised, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.\nA record of employee participation in the training program must be maintained.  Training documentation must include employee name, date of training, and the means used to verify the employee understood the training (e.g., oral or written exam).\n\nProgram 3 Mechanical Integrity Program Requirements\nThe Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program applies to the Boron Trichloride, Hydrogen Chlouride and nitric  oxide systems.  According to the CalARP RMP rule, the following process equipment must be included in a Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program:\n    Pressure vessels and storage tanks;\n    Piping systems (including piping components such as valves);\n    Relief and vent systems and devices;\n    Emergency shutdown systems;\n    Controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks); and\n    Pumps.\nIn general, the Mechanical Integrity program must incorporate the following:\n1. Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, including periodic maintenance, inspection, testing, and servicing procedures as further outlined below:\n    Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and \nemployee training is to identify process hazards and determine how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  For contractors hired to do maintenance on a Program 2 CalARP RMP covered process, Scott must ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  The maintenance program procedures were most recently reviewed in July 1999.\n\nManagement of Change Procedure\nThe Management of Change procedure is documented in the PSM Manual.  The procedure meets all of the requirements of the CalARP RMP Section 2760.6.  The Safety Manager is responsible for updating and implementing the Management of Change program.  \nThe Management of Change documentation will be maintained in Central Files, in the Management of Change file with appropriate, associated documentation, including, but not limited to:\n     Safety Review Checklists,\n     PHA documents, and\n     Training documentation.\n\nScott Compliance Audit Program\nScott has developed an organized and well-documented compliance audit program.  Responsibility for the compliance audit has been assigned to the Safety Manager, who may delegate specific responsibilities and select an audit team, as appropriate.  The audit begins with a kick-off meeting for all involved with RMP management.  Then, each element of the RMP is assessed through employee interviews, review of records, and selected field observations.  \nAfter the compliance audit, draft and final reports are issued.  All responsible personnel receive copies and are expected to respond to the list of findings.  The Safety Manager, through the RMP Committee, coordinates follow-up on all findings and responses.  The Safety Manager maintains reports and records of response to findings.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure \nIncidents should be investigated by the Plant Manager, by the Production Supervisor or designated representative, and other trained plant personnel as needed.  At least one person knowledgeable about the process should be included on the investigation team and a contractor employee must be included if the incident involved the work of a contractor.\nThe incident investigation facts should be reviewed by the Plant Manager or designated representative, and a cause of the event should be determined and specific actions should be recommended to prevent a reoccurrence.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report must be completed within 5 working days of the incident.\nThe Production Supervisor shall submit the Incident Investigation Summary Report to appropriate management personnel for their review/approval.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report will include the following\n     Date and time of the incident;\n     Date the inspection began;\n     Description of the incident;\n     The factors that contributed to the incident;\n     How the incident could have been prevented; and\n     Any recommendations resulting from the investigation, individual(s) accountable for resolution, target date(s), and completion date(s).\nCorrective action and means of resolution developed from the incident investigation must be documented in the Incident Investigation Summary Report.  The most recent incident investigation resulted from an incident that occurred on 15 February 2001.  No procedural changes\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\nThe primary mechanism for employee involvement and awareness is through the RMP Committee, which is described in Section 2, Management System.  The RMP Committee ensures senior management as well as employee involvement in overseeing and implementing RMP activities.  Department managers have responsibilities for performing specific RMP activities, as outlined in Section 2.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\nThe full description of Scott?s Hot Work Permit issuance procedures is included in the facility?s PSM Manual.  The program meets all of the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.11.  The Safety Manager has responsibility for implementing and updating the Hot Work Permit program.\n\nScott Contractors Program Scott has a comprehensive contractor control program, which begins with the initial screening of contractors.  Responsibilities are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The main points of the Scott contractors program are summarized here.\n     All Requests for Contracts by Scott departments identify work to be performed on or near processes involving arsine or nitric oxide.\n     All Request for Bid packages require contractor submission of information on the contractor?s safety record, safety program, and  relevant experience and qualifications.  The contractor must be pre-qualified prior to being approved for work.\n     The Scott Supervisor requesting the contract work is designated as the Contractor Supervisor for the requested work.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor participates in the contractor selection process.\n     All new contractor employees receive orientation on facility safety procedures.\n     Contractor employees sign in and out each day.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor conducts daily evaluations of contractor employee work.\n     The Contractor Supervisor conducts meetings at the start of each contractor work shift to review work activities to be conducted and work permits needed.  \n     Documentation is maintained of orientations, evaluations, and other pertinent information.\nThe detailed Contractor Program for arsine and nitric oxide is maintained in the PSM Manual.  The Program meets all the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.12.  The Contractor Program was most recently updated in December 1999.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR CALARP RMP CHEMICALS\nEmergency Situations\nThe EPRP will be activated in the following emergency situations:\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals that trigger the sensors and alarms; and\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals with the potential to harm human health or  the environment.\nReporting Emergency Situations\nAny Scott employee or contractor employee may report an emergency situation.  All personnel are encouraged to notify any supervisor when they know or suspect that a release of any hazardous chemical has occurred at the facility.

              "Description": "PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe purpose of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to ensure that written information is compiled for all Scott covered processes.  This compilation of information is designed to enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in processes utilizing ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, or nitric oxide.  The PSI documents are as follows:\n\n1. The hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide;\n2. Technical information on the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems; and \n3. Design information on the process equipment.\n\nPSI activities are required under the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (Cal/OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard Title 8, Section 5189(D) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).\nSummary of Scott Process Safety Information Requirements\nWritten PSI, documenting the information discussed below, is to be compiled for each covered process at the facility; in this instance, these are the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems.\n1. Material hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide are to be identified, including:\n          Toxicity\n          Permissible exposure limits\n          Physical data\n          Thermal and chemical stability data\n          Reactivity data\n          Corrosivity data\n[Note:  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) may be adequate to comply with this requirement.]\n\n2. The technical bases of designs for the covered systems are to be documented, including:\n         The process chemistry\n     Maximum intended system inventory\n     Safe upper and lower operating limits for system items such as temperatures, pressures, flows, or compositions \n     An evaluation of the consequences of system operation deviation,                including those affecting the safety and health of employees\n\n3. Equipment design basis for the each system is to be documented, including:\n     Materials of construction \n     Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) \n     Electrical classification\n     Relief system design and design basis\n     Ventilation system design\n     Safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection or suppression systems)\n     Design codes and standards that were used in the design\n\nWritten PSI is to be compiled before conducting a PHA on a covered process.  This information forms the basis for identifying and understanding the potential hazards associated with a covered process.  The information is also essential for thorough completion of other RMP activities, such as Management of Change, Operating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations.\nThe PSI shall be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Safety Information Overview\nScott believes that complete and accurate written information concerning each RMP chemical, each RMP chemical process technology, and each RMP chemical process equipment is essential to an effective RMP Program.  \nThe purpose of the PSI Program is as follows:\n    To enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the hazards involved with the RMP chemicals;\n    To provide information for a complete and thorough PHA; \n    To support other RMP activities, such as Management of Change \nOperating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations; \n    To provide information on the hazards involved with ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide to Scott employees and contractors; and to document that the covered process systems are designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nToxic Gas Monitoring\nThe H Building, the enclosed areas in the H Building, the laboratory and the B Building are monitored with toxic gas monitors.  An MDA 7100 monitor, two MDA CM4 monitors, two System 16 monitors that continuously sample the air for hydrides, mineral acids, corrosives and chlorine.  A System 57 monitors the Laboratory also ammonia and flammables in the H bldg. These monitors will detect levels of ammonia, arsine, Boron trichlouride, chlorine, hydrogen and Nitric Oxide at different alarm levels\n\nFire Protection\nThe H Building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  The system was installed and is maintained in accordance with Uniform Fire Code requirements.\n\nOther Process Safety Information\nThe following information is contained in the Standard Operating Procedures:\n    Safe upper and lower limits for major process parameters;\n    Consequences of deviation from established safe limits; and\n    Safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.  Because the systems are covered by the RMP standard, an initial PHA must be performed and recertified every 5 years.\n\nConducting the Process Hazard Analysis\nFor each ?What-if? question raised by the study team during the meetings, the team identified the current potential hazards, their consequences, severity, and likelihood of occurrence, as well as recommendations to reduce, eliminate, or control the hazards.  If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\nThe PHA addressed the following issues:\n1.   The potential hazards of the process.\n2.   The identification of any previous incidents that had a likely potential for consequences in the workplace.\n3.   Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the potential hazards.\n4.   Potential consequences in the event of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\nPHAs are required only for Program 3 covered processes.  PHAs were also conducted for the Program 2 covered processes (in lieu of simpler hazard reviews) due to the similarity of the processes and the ease of maintaining the PHA teams.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.

If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\n\nProgram 3 Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures for Program 3 covered processes must be available for the arsine and nitric oxide processes and must address the following elements:\n1. Steps for each operating phase:\n    Initial startup\n    Normal operations\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n2. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n3. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n    Precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n4. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n5. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n\nScott Operating Procedures\nAll ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide process operations at the Scott Fremont facility are governed, to some degree, by written Operating Procedures.  These Operating Procedures include guidance from the manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the specific process equipment.  All Operating Procedures have been and are developed through detailed discussion with operating personnel, who are considered a useful resource for practical job safety information.\nOperating Procedures are updated as necessary whenever there is a change in a covered process.  The Safety Manager oversees the development and revision of the Operating Procedures when process change occurs.  The Production Manual contains the most recent control versions of specific Operating Procedures.\nCurrent Operating Procedures are distributed to and maintained in the production area.  They are used as the basis for all new and updated operator training.  Operators and other personnel who could have an impact on the safety of covered processes, such as contractors, are trained on any revisions to Operating Procedures before changes are implemented.\n\nTRAINING\nProgram 3 Training Requirements\nEach employee involved in operating a Program 3 covered process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.  The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazard, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.\nRefresher training is required at least once every 3 years, or at any time the procedures are revised, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.\nA record of employee participation in the training program must be maintained.  Training documentation must include employee name, date of training, and the means used to verify the employee understood the training (e.g., oral or written exam).\n\nProgram 3 Mechanical Integrity Program Requirements\nThe Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program applies to the Boron Trichloride, Hydrogen Chlouride and nitric  oxide systems.  According to the CalARP RMP rule, the following process equipment must be included in a Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program:\n    Pressure vessels and storage tanks;\n    Piping systems (including piping components such as valves);\n    Relief and vent systems and devices;\n    Emergency shutdown systems;\n    Controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks); and\n    Pumps.\nIn general, the Mechanical Integrity program must incorporate the following:\n1. Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, including periodic maintenance, inspection, testing, and servicing procedures as further outlined below:\n    Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and \nemployee training is to identify process hazards and determine how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  For contractors hired to do maintenance on a Program 2 CalARP RMP covered process, Scott must ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  The maintenance program procedures were most recently reviewed in July 1999.\n\nManagement of Change Procedure\nThe Management of Change procedure is documented in the PSM Manual.  The procedure meets all of the requirements of the CalARP RMP Section 2760.6.  The Safety Manager is responsible for updating and implementing the Management of Change program.  \nThe Management of Change documentation will be maintained in Central Files, in the Management of Change file with appropriate, associated documentation, including, but not limited to:\n     Safety Review Checklists,\n     PHA documents, and\n     Training documentation.\n\nScott Compliance Audit Program\nScott has developed an organized and well-documented compliance audit program.  Responsibility for the compliance audit has been assigned to the Safety Manager, who may delegate specific responsibilities and select an audit team, as appropriate.  The audit begins with a kick-off meeting for all involved with RMP management.  Then, each element of the RMP is assessed through employee interviews, review of records, and selected field observations.  \nAfter the compliance audit, draft and final reports are issued.  All responsible personnel receive copies and are expected to respond to the list of findings.  The Safety Manager, through the RMP Committee, coordinates follow-up on all findings and responses.  The Safety Manager maintains reports and records of response to findings.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure \nIncidents should be investigated by the Plant Manager, by the Production Supervisor or designated representative, and other trained plant personnel as needed.  At least one person knowledgeable about the process should be included on the investigation team and a contractor employee must be included if the incident involved the work of a contractor.\nThe incident investigation facts should be reviewed by the Plant Manager or designated representative, and a cause of the event should be determined and specific actions should be recommended to prevent a reoccurrence.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report must be completed within 5 working days of the incident.\nThe Production Supervisor shall submit the Incident Investigation Summary Report to appropriate management personnel for their review/approval.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report will include the following\n     Date and time of the incident;\n     Date the inspection began;\n     Description of the incident;\n     The factors that contributed to the incident;\n     How the incident could have been prevented; and\n     Any recommendations resulting from the investigation, individual(s) accountable for resolution, target date(s), and completion date(s).\nCorrective action and means of resolution developed from the incident investigation must be documented in the Incident Investigation Summary Report.  The most recent incident investigation resulted from an incident that occurred on 15 February 2001.  No procedural changes\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\nThe primary mechanism for employee involvement and awareness is through the RMP Committee, which is described in Section 2, Management System.  The RMP Committee ensures senior management as well as employee involvement in overseeing and implementing RMP activities.  Department managers have responsibilities for performing specific RMP activities, as outlined in Section 2.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\nThe full description of Scott?s Hot Work Permit issuance procedures is included in the facility?s PSM Manual.  The program meets all of the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.11.  The Safety Manager has responsibility for implementing and updating the Hot Work Permit program.\n\nScott Contractors Program Scott has a comprehensive contractor control program, which begins with the initial screening of contractors.  Responsibilities are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The main points of the Scott contractors program are summarized here.\n     All Requests for Contracts by Scott departments identify work to be performed on or near processes involving arsine or nitric oxide.\n     All Request for Bid packages require contractor submission of information on the contractor?s safety record, safety program, and  relevant experience and qualifications.  The contractor must be pre-qualified prior to being approved for work.\n     The Scott Supervisor requesting the contract work is designated as the Contractor Supervisor for the requested work.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor participates in the contractor selection process.\n     All new contractor employees receive orientation on facility safety procedures.\n     Contractor employees sign in and out each day.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor conducts daily evaluations of contractor employee work.\n     The Contractor Supervisor conducts meetings at the start of each contractor work shift to review work activities to be conducted and work permits needed.  \n     Documentation is maintained of orientations, evaluations, and other pertinent information.\nThe detailed Contractor Program for arsine and nitric oxide is maintained in the PSM Manual.  The Program meets all the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.12.  The Contractor Program was most recently updated in December 1999.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR CALARP RMP CHEMICALS\nEmergency Situations\nThe EPRP will be activated in the following emergency situations:\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals that trigger the sensors and alarms; and\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals with the potential to harm human health or  the environment.\nReporting Emergency Situations\nAny Scott employee or contractor employee may report an emergency situation.  All personnel are encouraged to notify any supervisor when they know or suspect that a release of any hazardous chemical has occurred at the facility.  When contacting the supervisor, personnel should provide as much information as possible regarding the known or suspected situation.  If a supervisor is not immediately available, the employee may activate the toxic release alarm and evacuate the building",

              "Description": "PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe purpose of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to ensure that written information is compiled for all Scott covered processes.  This compilation of information is designed to enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in processes utilizing ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, or nitric oxide.  The PSI documents are as follows:\n\n1. The hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide;\n2. Technical information on the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems; and \n3. Design information on the process equipment.\n\nPSI activities are required under the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (Cal/OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard Title 8, Section 5189(D) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).\nSummary of Scott Process Safety Information Requirements\nWritten PSI, documenting the information discussed below, is to be compiled for each covered process at the facility; in this instance, these are the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems.\n1. Material hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide are to be identified, including:\n          Toxicity\n          Permissible exposure limits\n          Physical data\n          Thermal and chemical stability data\n          Reactivity data\n          Corrosivity data\n[Note:  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) may be adequate to comply with this requirement.]\n\n2. The technical bases of designs for the covered systems are to be documented, including:\n         The process chemistry\n     Maximum intended system inventory\n     Safe upper and lower operating limits for system items such as temperatures, pressures, flows, or compositions \n     An evaluation of the consequences of system operation deviation,                including those affecting the safety and health of employees\n\n3. Equipment design basis for the each system is to be documented, including:\n     Materials of construction \n     Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) \n     Electrical classification\n     Relief system design and design basis\n     Ventilation system design\n     Safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection or suppression systems)\n     Design codes and standards that were used in the design\n\nWritten PSI is to be compiled before conducting a PHA on a covered process.  This information forms the basis for identifying and understanding the potential hazards associated with a covered process.  The information is also essential for thorough completion of other RMP activities, such as Management of Change, Operating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations.\nThe PSI shall be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Safety Information Overview\nScott believes that complete and accurate written information concerning each RMP chemical, each RMP chemical process technology, and each RMP chemical process equipment is essential to an effective RMP Program.  \nThe purpose of the PSI Program is as follows:\n    To enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the hazards involved with the RMP chemicals;\n    To provide information for a complete and thorough PHA; \n    To support other RMP activities, such as Management of Change \nOperating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations; \n    To provide information on the hazards involved with ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide to Scott employees and contractors; and to document that the covered process systems are designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nToxic Gas Monitoring\nThe H Building, the enclosed areas in the H Building, the laboratory and the B Building are monitored with toxic gas monitors.  An MDA 7100 monitor, two MDA CM4 monitors, two System 16 monitors that continuously sample the air for hydrides, mineral acids, corrosives and chlorine.  A System 57 monitors the Laboratory also ammonia and flammables in the H bldg. These monitors will detect levels of ammonia, arsine, Boron trichlouride, chlorine, hydrogen and Nitric Oxide at different alarm levels\n\nFire Protection\nThe H Building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  The system was installed and is maintained in accordance with Uniform Fire Code requirements.\n\nOther Process Safety Information\nThe following information is contained in the Standard Operating Procedures:\n    Safe upper and lower limits for major process parameters;\n    Consequences of deviation from established safe limits; and\n    Safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.  Because the systems are covered by the RMP standard, an initial PHA must be performed and recertified every 5 years.\n\nConducting the Process Hazard Analysis\nFor each ?What-if? question raised by the study team during the meetings, the team identified the current potential hazards, their consequences, severity, and likelihood of occurrence, as well as recommendations to reduce, eliminate, or control the hazards.  If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\nThe PHA addressed the following issues:\n1.   The potential hazards of the process.\n2.   The identification of any previous incidents that had a likely potential for consequences in the workplace.\n3.   Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the potential hazards.\n4.   Potential consequences in the event of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\nPHAs are required only for Program 3 covered processes.  PHAs were also conducted for the Program 2 covered processes (in lieu of simpler hazard reviews) due to the similarity of the processes and the ease of maintaining the PHA teams.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.

If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\n\nProgram 3 Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures for Program 3 covered processes must be available for the arsine and nitric oxide processes and must address the following elements:\n1. Steps for each operating phase:\n    Initial startup\n    Normal operations\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n2. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n3. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n    Precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n4. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n5. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n\nScott Operating Procedures\nAll ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide process operations at the Scott Fremont facility are governed, to some degree, by written Operating Procedures.  These Operating Procedures include guidance from the manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the specific process equipment.  All Operating Procedures have been and are developed through detailed discussion with operating personnel, who are considered a useful resource for practical job safety information.\nOperating Procedures are updated as necessary whenever there is a change in a covered process.  The Safety Manager oversees the development and revision of the Operating Procedures when process change occurs.  The Production Manual contains the most recent control versions of specific Operating Procedures.\nCurrent Operating Procedures are distributed to and maintained in the production area.  They are used as the basis for all new and updated operator training.  Operators and other personnel who could have an impact on the safety of covered processes, such as contractors, are trained on any revisions to Operating Procedures before changes are implemented.\n\nTRAINING\nProgram 3 Training Requirements\nEach employee involved in operating a Program 3 covered process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.  The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazard, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.\nRefresher training is required at least once every 3 years, or at any time the procedures are revised, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.\nA record of employee participation in the training program must be maintained.  Training documentation must include employee name, date of training, and the means used to verify the employee understood the training (e.g., oral or written exam).\n\nProgram 3 Mechanical Integrity Program Requirements\nThe Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program applies to the Boron Trichloride, Hydrogen Chlouride and nitric  oxide systems.  According to the CalARP RMP rule, the following process equipment must be included in a Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program:\n    Pressure vessels and storage tanks;\n    Piping systems (including piping components such as valves);\n    Relief and vent systems and devices;\n    Emergency shutdown systems;\n    Controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks); and\n    Pumps.\nIn general, the Mechanical Integrity program must incorporate the following:\n1. Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, including periodic maintenance, inspection, testing, and servicing procedures as further outlined below:\n    Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and \nemployee training is to identify process hazards and determine how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  For contractors hired to do maintenance on a Program 2 CalARP RMP covered process, Scott must ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  The maintenance program procedures were most recently reviewed in July 1999.\n\nManagement of Change Procedure\nThe Management of Change procedure is documented in the PSM Manual.  The procedure meets all of the requirements of the CalARP RMP Section 2760.6.  The Safety Manager is responsible for updating and implementing the Management of Change program.  \nThe Management of Change documentation will be maintained in Central Files, in the Management of Change file with appropriate, associated documentation, including, but not limited to:\n     Safety Review Checklists,\n     PHA documents, and\n     Training documentation.\n\nScott Compliance Audit Program\nScott has developed an organized and well-documented compliance audit program.  Responsibility for the compliance audit has been assigned to the Safety Manager, who may delegate specific responsibilities and select an audit team, as appropriate.  The audit begins with a kick-off meeting for all involved with RMP management.  Then, each element of the RMP is assessed through employee interviews, review of records, and selected field observations.  \nAfter the compliance audit, draft and final reports are issued.  All responsible personnel receive copies and are expected to respond to the list of findings.  The Safety Manager, through the RMP Committee, coordinates follow-up on all findings and responses.  The Safety Manager maintains reports and records of response to findings.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure \nIncidents should be investigated by the Plant Manager, by the Production Supervisor or designated representative, and other trained plant personnel as needed.  At least one person knowledgeable about the process should be included on the investigation team and a contractor employee must be included if the incident involved the work of a contractor.\nThe incident investigation facts should be reviewed by the Plant Manager or designated representative, and a cause of the event should be determined and specific actions should be recommended to prevent a reoccurrence.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report must be completed within 5 working days of the incident.\nThe Production Supervisor shall submit the Incident Investigation Summary Report to appropriate management personnel for their review/approval.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report will include the following\n     Date and time of the incident;\n     Date the inspection began;\n     Description of the incident;\n     The factors that contributed to the incident;\n     How the incident could have been prevented; and\n     Any recommendations resulting from the investigation, individual(s) accountable for resolution, target date(s), and completion date(s).\nCorrective action and means of resolution developed from the incident investigation must be documented in the Incident Investigation Summary Report.  The most recent incident investigation resulted from an incident that occurred on 15 February 2001.  No procedural changes\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\nThe primary mechanism for employee involvement and awareness is through the RMP Committee, which is described in Section 2, Management System.  The RMP Committee ensures senior management as well as employee involvement in overseeing and implementing RMP activities.  Department managers have responsibilities for performing specific RMP activities, as outlined in Section 2.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\nThe full description of Scott?s Hot Work Permit issuance procedures is included in the facility?s PSM Manual.  The program meets all of the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.11.  The Safety Manager has responsibility for implementing and updating the Hot Work Permit program.\n\nScott Contractors Program Scott has a comprehensive contractor control program, which begins with the initial screening of contractors.  Responsibilities are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The main points of the Scott contractors program are summarized here.\n     All Requests for Contracts by Scott departments identify work to be performed on or near processes involving arsine or nitric oxide.\n     All Request for Bid packages require contractor submission of information on the contractor?s safety record, safety program, and  relevant experience and qualifications.  The contractor must be pre-qualified prior to being approved for work.\n     The Scott Supervisor requesting the contract work is designated as the Contractor Supervisor for the requested work.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor participates in the contractor selection process.\n     All new contractor employees receive orientation on facility safety procedures.\n     Contractor employees sign in and out each day.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor conducts daily evaluations of contractor employee work.\n     The Contractor Supervisor conducts meetings at the start of each contractor work shift to review work activities to be conducted and work permits needed.  \n     Documentation is maintained of orientations, evaluations, and other pertinent information.\nThe detailed Contractor Program for arsine and nitric oxide is maintained in the PSM Manual.  The Program meets all the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.12.  The Contractor Program was most recently updated in December 1999.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR CALARP RMP CHEMICALS\nEmergency Situations\nThe EPRP will be activated in the following emergency situations:\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals that trigger the sensors and alarms; and\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals with the potential to harm human health or  the environment.\nReporting Emergency Situations\nAny Scott employee or contractor employee may report an emergency situation.  All personnel are encouraged to notify any supervisor when they know or suspect that a release of any hazardous chemical has occurred at the facility.  When contacting the supervisor, personnel should provide as much information as possible regarding the known or suspected situation.  If a supervisor is not immediately available, the employee may activate the toxic release alarm and evacuate the building",

              "Description": "PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe purpose of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to ensure that written information is compiled for all Scott covered processes.  This compilation of information is designed to enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in processes utilizing ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, or nitric oxide.  The PSI documents are as follows:\n\n1. The hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide;\n2. Technical information on the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems; and \n3. Design information on the process equipment.\n\nPSI activities are required under the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (Cal/OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard Title 8, Section 5189(D) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).\nSummary of Scott Process Safety Information Requirements\nWritten PSI, documenting the information discussed below, is to be compiled for each covered process at the facility; in this instance, these are the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems.\n1. Material hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide are to be identified, including:\n          Toxicity\n          Permissible exposure limits\n          Physical data\n          Thermal and chemical stability data\n          Reactivity data\n          Corrosivity data\n[Note:  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) may be adequate to comply with this requirement.]\n\n2. The technical bases of designs for the covered systems are to be documented, including:\n         The process chemistry\n     Maximum intended system inventory\n     Safe upper and lower operating limits for system items such as temperatures, pressures, flows, or compositions \n     An evaluation of the consequences of system operation deviation,                including those affecting the safety and health of employees\n\n3. Equipment design basis for the each system is to be documented, including:\n     Materials of construction \n     Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) \n     Electrical classification\n     Relief system design and design basis\n     Ventilation system design\n     Safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection or suppression systems)\n     Design codes and standards that were used in the design\n\nWritten PSI is to be compiled before conducting a PHA on a covered process.  This information forms the basis for identifying and understanding the potential hazards associated with a covered process.  The information is also essential for thorough completion of other RMP activities, such as Management of Change, Operating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations.\nThe PSI shall be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Safety Information Overview\nScott believes that complete and accurate written information concerning each RMP chemical, each RMP chemical process technology, and each RMP chemical process equipment is essential to an effective RMP Program.  \nThe purpose of the PSI Program is as follows:\n    To enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the hazards involved with the RMP chemicals;\n    To provide information for a complete and thorough PHA; \n    To support other RMP activities, such as Management of Change \nOperating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations; \n    To provide information on the hazards involved with ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide to Scott employees and contractors; and to document that the covered process systems are designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nToxic Gas Monitoring\nThe H Building, the enclosed areas in the H Building, the laboratory and the B Building are monitored with toxic gas monitors.  An MDA 7100 monitor, two MDA CM4 monitors, two System 16 monitors that continuously sample the air for hydrides, mineral acids, corrosives and chlorine.  A System 57 monitors the Laboratory also ammonia and flammables in the H bldg. These monitors will detect levels of ammonia, arsine, Boron trichlouride, chlorine, hydrogen and Nitric Oxide at different alarm levels\n\nFire Protection\nThe H Building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  The system was installed and is maintained in accordance with Uniform Fire Code requirements.\n\nOther Process Safety Information\nThe following information is contained in the Standard Operating Procedures:\n    Safe upper and lower limits for major process parameters;\n    Consequences of deviation from established safe limits; and\n    Safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.  Because the systems are covered by the RMP standard, an initial PHA must be performed and recertified every 5 years.\n\nConducting the Process Hazard Analysis\nFor each ?What-if? question raised by the study team during the meetings, the team identified the current potential hazards, their consequences, severity, and likelihood of occurrence, as well as recommendations to reduce, eliminate, or control the hazards.  If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\nThe PHA addressed the following issues:\n1.   The potential hazards of the process.\n2.   The identification of any previous incidents that had a likely potential for consequences in the workplace.\n3.   Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the potential hazards.\n4.   Potential consequences in the event of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\nPHAs are required only for Program 3 covered processes.  PHAs were also conducted for the Program 2 covered processes (in lieu of simpler hazard reviews) due to the similarity of the processes and the ease of maintaining the PHA teams.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.

If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\n\nProgram 3 Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures for Program 3 covered processes must be available for the arsine and nitric oxide processes and must address the following elements:\n1. Steps for each operating phase:\n    Initial startup\n    Normal operations\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n2. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n3. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n    Precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n4. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n5. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n\nScott Operating Procedures\nAll ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide process operations at the Scott Fremont facility are governed, to some degree, by written Operating Procedures.  These Operating Procedures include guidance from the manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the specific process equipment.  All Operating Procedures have been and are developed through detailed discussion with operating personnel, who are considered a useful resource for practical job safety information.\nOperating Procedures are updated as necessary whenever there is a change in a covered process.  The Safety Manager oversees the development and revision of the Operating Procedures when process change occurs.  The Production Manual contains the most recent control versions of specific Operating Procedures.\nCurrent Operating Procedures are distributed to and maintained in the production area.  They are used as the basis for all new and updated operator training.  Operators and other personnel who could have an impact on the safety of covered processes, such as contractors, are trained on any revisions to Operating Procedures before changes are implemented.\n\nTRAINING\nProgram 3 Training Requirements\nEach employee involved in operating a Program 3 covered process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.  The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazard, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.\nRefresher training is required at least once every 3 years, or at any time the procedures are revised, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.\nA record of employee participation in the training program must be maintained.  Training documentation must include employee name, date of training, and the means used to verify the employee understood the training (e.g., oral or written exam).\n\nProgram 3 Mechanical Integrity Program Requirements\nThe Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program applies to the Boron Trichloride, Hydrogen Chlouride and nitric  oxide systems.  According to the CalARP RMP rule, the following process equipment must be included in a Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program:\n    Pressure vessels and storage tanks;\n    Piping systems (including piping components such as valves);\n    Relief and vent systems and devices;\n    Emergency shutdown systems;\n    Controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks); and\n    Pumps.\nIn general, the Mechanical Integrity program must incorporate the following:\n1. Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, including periodic maintenance, inspection, testing, and servicing procedures as further outlined below:\n    Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and \nemployee training is to identify process hazards and determine how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  For contractors hired to do maintenance on a Program 2 CalARP RMP covered process, Scott must ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  The maintenance program procedures were most recently reviewed in July 1999.\n\nManagement of Change Procedure\nThe Management of Change procedure is documented in the PSM Manual.  The procedure meets all of the requirements of the CalARP RMP Section 2760.6.  The Safety Manager is responsible for updating and implementing the Management of Change program.  \nThe Management of Change documentation will be maintained in Central Files, in the Management of Change file with appropriate, associated documentation, including, but not limited to:\n     Safety Review Checklists,\n     PHA documents, and\n     Training documentation.\n\nScott Compliance Audit Program\nScott has developed an organized and well-documented compliance audit program.  Responsibility for the compliance audit has been assigned to the Safety Manager, who may delegate specific responsibilities and select an audit team, as appropriate.  The audit begins with a kick-off meeting for all involved with RMP management.  Then, each element of the RMP is assessed through employee interviews, review of records, and selected field observations.  \nAfter the compliance audit, draft and final reports are issued.  All responsible personnel receive copies and are expected to respond to the list of findings.  The Safety Manager, through the RMP Committee, coordinates follow-up on all findings and responses.  The Safety Manager maintains reports and records of response to findings.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure \nIncidents should be investigated by the Plant Manager, by the Production Supervisor or designated representative, and other trained plant personnel as needed.  At least one person knowledgeable about the process should be included on the investigation team and a contractor employee must be included if the incident involved the work of a contractor.\nThe incident investigation facts should be reviewed by the Plant Manager or designated representative, and a cause of the event should be determined and specific actions should be recommended to prevent a reoccurrence.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report must be completed within 5 working days of the incident.\nThe Production Supervisor shall submit the Incident Investigation Summary Report to appropriate management personnel for their review/approval.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report will include the following\n     Date and time of the incident;\n     Date the inspection began;\n     Description of the incident;\n     The factors that contributed to the incident;\n     How the incident could have been prevented; and\n     Any recommendations resulting from the investigation, individual(s) accountable for resolution, target date(s), and completion date(s).\nCorrective action and means of resolution developed from the incident investigation must be documented in the Incident Investigation Summary Report.  The most recent incident investigation resulted from an incident that occurred on 15 February 2001.  No procedural changes\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\nThe primary mechanism for employee involvement and awareness is through the RMP Committee, which is described in Section 2, Management System.  The RMP Committee ensures senior management as well as employee involvement in overseeing and implementing RMP activities.  Department managers have responsibilities for performing specific RMP activities, as outlined in Section 2.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\nThe full description of Scott?s Hot Work Permit issuance procedures is included in the facility?s PSM Manual.  The program meets all of the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.11.  The Safety Manager has responsibility for implementing and updating the Hot Work Permit program.\n\nScott Contractors Program Scott has a comprehensive contractor control program, which begins with the initial screening of contractors.  Responsibilities are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The main points of the Scott contractors program are summarized here.\n     All Requests for Contracts by Scott departments identify work to be performed on or near processes involving arsine or nitric oxide.\n     All Request for Bid packages require contractor submission of information on the contractor?s safety record, safety program, and  relevant experience and qualifications.  The contractor must be pre-qualified prior to being approved for work.\n     The Scott Supervisor requesting the contract work is designated as the Contractor Supervisor for the requested work.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor participates in the contractor selection process.\n     All new contractor employees receive orientation on facility safety procedures.\n     Contractor employees sign in and out each day.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor conducts daily evaluations of contractor employee work.\n     The Contractor Supervisor conducts meetings at the start of each contractor work shift to review work activities to be conducted and work permits needed.  \n     Documentation is maintained of orientations, evaluations, and other pertinent information.\nThe detailed Contractor Program for arsine and nitric oxide is maintained in the PSM Manual.  The Program meets all the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.12.  The Contractor Program was most recently updated in December 1999.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR CALARP RMP CHEMICALS\nEmergency Situations\nThe EPRP will be activated in the following emergency situations:\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals that trigger the sensors and alarms; and\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals with the potential to harm human health or  the environment.\nReporting Emergency Situations\nAny Scott employee or contractor employee may report an emergency situation.  All personnel are encouraged to notify any supervisor when they know or suspect that a release of any hazardous chemical has occurred at the facility.  When contacting the supervisor, personnel should provide as much information as possible regarding the known or suspected situation.  If a supervisor is not immediately available, the employee may activate the toxic release alarm and evacuate the building",

              "Description": "PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe purpose of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to ensure that written information is compiled for all Scott covered processes.  This compilation of information is designed to enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in processes utilizing ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, or nitric oxide.  The PSI documents are as follows:\n\n1. The hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide;\n2. Technical information on the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems; and \n3. Design information on the process equipment.\n\nPSI activities are required under the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (Cal/OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard Title 8, Section 5189(D) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).\nSummary of Scott Process Safety Information Requirements\nWritten PSI, documenting the information discussed below, is to be compiled for each covered process at the facility; in this instance, these are the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems.\n1. Material hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide are to be identified, including:\n          Toxicity\n          Permissible exposure limits\n          Physical data\n          Thermal and chemical stability data\n          Reactivity data\n          Corrosivity data\n[Note:  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) may be adequate to comply with this requirement.]\n\n2. The technical bases of designs for the covered systems are to be documented, including:\n         The process chemistry\n     Maximum intended system inventory\n     Safe upper and lower operating limits for system items such as temperatures, pressures, flows, or compositions \n     An evaluation of the consequences of system operation deviation,                including those affecting the safety and health of employees\n\n3. Equipment design basis for the each system is to be documented, including:\n     Materials of construction \n     Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) \n     Electrical classification\n     Relief system design and design basis\n     Ventilation system design\n     Safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection or suppression systems)\n     Design codes and standards that were used in the design\n\nWritten PSI is to be compiled before conducting a PHA on a covered process.  This information forms the basis for identifying and understanding the potential hazards associated with a covered process.  The information is also essential for thorough completion of other RMP activities, such as Management of Change, Operating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations.\nThe PSI shall be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Safety Information Overview\nScott believes that complete and accurate written information concerning each RMP chemical, each RMP chemical process technology, and each RMP chemical process equipment is essential to an effective RMP Program.  \nThe purpose of the PSI Program is as follows:\n    To enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the hazards involved with the RMP chemicals;\n    To provide information for a complete and thorough PHA; \n    To support other RMP activities, such as Management of Change \nOperating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations; \n    To provide information on the hazards involved with ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide to Scott employees and contractors; and to document that the covered process systems are designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nToxic Gas Monitoring\nThe H Building, the enclosed areas in the H Building, the laboratory and the B Building are monitored with toxic gas monitors.  An MDA 7100 monitor, two MDA CM4 monitors, two System 16 monitors that continuously sample the air for hydrides, mineral acids, corrosives and chlorine.  A System 57 monitors the Laboratory also ammonia and flammables in the H bldg. These monitors will detect levels of ammonia, arsine, Boron trichlouride, chlorine, hydrogen and Nitric Oxide at different alarm levels\n\nFire Protection\nThe H Building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  The system was installed and is maintained in accordance with Uniform Fire Code requirements.\n\nOther Process Safety Information\nThe following information is contained in the Standard Operating Procedures:\n    Safe upper and lower limits for major process parameters;\n    Consequences of deviation from established safe limits; and\n    Safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.  Because the systems are covered by the RMP standard, an initial PHA must be performed and recertified every 5 years.\n\nConducting the Process Hazard Analysis\nFor each ?What-if? question raised by the study team during the meetings, the team identified the current potential hazards, their consequences, severity, and likelihood of occurrence, as well as recommendations to reduce, eliminate, or control the hazards.  If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\nThe PHA addressed the following issues:\n1.   The potential hazards of the process.\n2.   The identification of any previous incidents that had a likely potential for consequences in the workplace.\n3.   Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the potential hazards.\n4.   Potential consequences in the event of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\nPHAs are required only for Program 3 covered processes.  PHAs were also conducted for the Program 2 covered processes (in lieu of simpler hazard reviews) due to the similarity of the processes and the ease of maintaining the PHA teams.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.

If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\n\nProgram 3 Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures for Program 3 covered processes must be available for the arsine and nitric oxide processes and must address the following elements:\n1. Steps for each operating phase:\n    Initial startup\n    Normal operations\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n2. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n3. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n    Precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n4. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n5. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n\nScott Operating Procedures\nAll ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide process operations at the Scott Fremont facility are governed, to some degree, by written Operating Procedures.  These Operating Procedures include guidance from the manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the specific process equipment.  All Operating Procedures have been and are developed through detailed discussion with operating personnel, who are considered a useful resource for practical job safety information.\nOperating Procedures are updated as necessary whenever there is a change in a covered process.  The Safety Manager oversees the development and revision of the Operating Procedures when process change occurs.  The Production Manual contains the most recent control versions of specific Operating Procedures.\nCurrent Operating Procedures are distributed to and maintained in the production area.  They are used as the basis for all new and updated operator training.  Operators and other personnel who could have an impact on the safety of covered processes, such as contractors, are trained on any revisions to Operating Procedures before changes are implemented.\n\nTRAINING\nProgram 3 Training Requirements\nEach employee involved in operating a Program 3 covered process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.  The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazard, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.\nRefresher training is required at least once every 3 years, or at any time the procedures are revised, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.\nA record of employee participation in the training program must be maintained.  Training documentation must include employee name, date of training, and the means used to verify the employee understood the training (e.g., oral or written exam).\n\nProgram 3 Mechanical Integrity Program Requirements\nThe Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program applies to the Boron Trichloride, Hydrogen Chlouride and nitric  oxide systems.  According to the CalARP RMP rule, the following process equipment must be included in a Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program:\n    Pressure vessels and storage tanks;\n    Piping systems (including piping components such as valves);\n    Relief and vent systems and devices;\n    Emergency shutdown systems;\n    Controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks); and\n    Pumps.\nIn general, the Mechanical Integrity program must incorporate the following:\n1. Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, including periodic maintenance, inspection, testing, and servicing procedures as further outlined below:\n    Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and \nemployee training is to identify process hazards and determine how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  For contractors hired to do maintenance on a Program 2 CalARP RMP covered process, Scott must ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  The maintenance program procedures were most recently reviewed in July 1999.\n\nManagement of Change Procedure\nThe Management of Change procedure is documented in the PSM Manual.  The procedure meets all of the requirements of the CalARP RMP Section 2760.6.  The Safety Manager is responsible for updating and implementing the Management of Change program.  \nThe Management of Change documentation will be maintained in Central Files, in the Management of Change file with appropriate, associated documentation, including, but not limited to:\n     Safety Review Checklists,\n     PHA documents, and\n     Training documentation.\n\nScott Compliance Audit Program\nScott has developed an organized and well-documented compliance audit program.  Responsibility for the compliance audit has been assigned to the Safety Manager, who may delegate specific responsibilities and select an audit team, as appropriate.  The audit begins with a kick-off meeting for all involved with RMP management.  Then, each element of the RMP is assessed through employee interviews, review of records, and selected field observations.  \nAfter the compliance audit, draft and final reports are issued.  All responsible personnel receive copies and are expected to respond to the list of findings.  The Safety Manager, through the RMP Committee, coordinates follow-up on all findings and responses.  The Safety Manager maintains reports and records of response to findings.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure \nIncidents should be investigated by the Plant Manager, by the Production Supervisor or designated representative, and other trained plant personnel as needed.  At least one person knowledgeable about the process should be included on the investigation team and a contractor employee must be included if the incident involved the work of a contractor.\nThe incident investigation facts should be reviewed by the Plant Manager or designated representative, and a cause of the event should be determined and specific actions should be recommended to prevent a reoccurrence.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report must be completed within 5 working days of the incident.\nThe Production Supervisor shall submit the Incident Investigation Summary Report to appropriate management personnel for their review/approval.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report will include the following\n     Date and time of the incident;\n     Date the inspection began;\n     Description of the incident;\n     The factors that contributed to the incident;\n     How the incident could have been prevented; and\n     Any recommendations resulting from the investigation, individual(s) accountable for resolution, target date(s), and completion date(s).\nCorrective action and means of resolution developed from the incident investigation must be documented in the Incident Investigation Summary Report.  The most recent incident investigation resulted from an incident that occurred on 15 February 2001.  No procedural changes\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\nThe primary mechanism for employee involvement and awareness is through the RMP Committee, which is described in Section 2, Management System.  The RMP Committee ensures senior management as well as employee involvement in overseeing and implementing RMP activities.  Department managers have responsibilities for performing specific RMP activities, as outlined in Section 2.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\nThe full description of Scott?s Hot Work Permit issuance procedures is included in the facility?s PSM Manual.  The program meets all of the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.11.  The Safety Manager has responsibility for implementing and updating the Hot Work Permit program.\n\nScott Contractors Program Scott has a comprehensive contractor control program, which begins with the initial screening of contractors.  Responsibilities are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The main points of the Scott contractors program are summarized here.\n     All Requests for Contracts by Scott departments identify work to be performed on or near processes involving arsine or nitric oxide.\n     All Request for Bid packages require contractor submission of information on the contractor?s safety record, safety program, and  relevant experience and qualifications.  The contractor must be pre-qualified prior to being approved for work.\n     The Scott Supervisor requesting the contract work is designated as the Contractor Supervisor for the requested work.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor participates in the contractor selection process.\n     All new contractor employees receive orientation on facility safety procedures.\n     Contractor employees sign in and out each day.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor conducts daily evaluations of contractor employee work.\n     The Contractor Supervisor conducts meetings at the start of each contractor work shift to review work activities to be conducted and work permits needed.  \n     Documentation is maintained of orientations, evaluations, and other pertinent information.\nThe detailed Contractor Program for arsine and nitric oxide is maintained in the PSM Manual.  The Program meets all the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.12.  The Contractor Program was most recently updated in December 1999.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR CALARP RMP CHEMICALS\nEmergency Situations\nThe EPRP will be activated in the following emergency situations:\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals that trigger the sensors and alarms; and\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals with the potential to harm human health or  the environment.\nReporting Emergency Situations\nAny Scott employee or contractor employee may report an emergency situation.  All personnel are encouraged to notify any supervisor when they know or suspect that a release of any hazardous chemical has occurred at the facility.  When contacting the supervisor, personnel should provide as much information as possible regarding the known or suspected situation.  If a supervisor is not immediately available, the employee may activate the toxic release alarm and evacuate the building",

              "Description": "PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe purpose of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to ensure that written information is compiled for all Scott covered processes.  This compilation of information is designed to enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in processes utilizing ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, or nitric oxide.  The PSI documents are as follows:\n\n1. The hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide;\n2. Technical information on the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems; and \n3. Design information on the process equipment.\n\nPSI activities are required under the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (Cal/OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard Title 8, Section 5189(D) of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).\nSummary of Scott Process Safety Information Requirements\nWritten PSI, documenting the information discussed below, is to be compiled for each covered process at the facility; in this instance, these are the ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide systems.\n1. Material hazards of ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide are to be identified, including:\n          Toxicity\n          Permissible exposure limits\n          Physical data\n          Thermal and chemical stability data\n          Reactivity data\n          Corrosivity data\n[Note:  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) may be adequate to comply with this requirement.]\n\n2. The technical bases of designs for the covered systems are to be documented, including:\n         The process chemistry\n     Maximum intended system inventory\n     Safe upper and lower operating limits for system items such as temperatures, pressures, flows, or compositions \n     An evaluation of the consequences of system operation deviation,                including those affecting the safety and health of employees\n\n3. Equipment design basis for the each system is to be documented, including:\n     Materials of construction \n     Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) \n     Electrical classification\n     Relief system design and design basis\n     Ventilation system design\n     Safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection or suppression systems)\n     Design codes and standards that were used in the design\n\nWritten PSI is to be compiled before conducting a PHA on a covered process.  This information forms the basis for identifying and understanding the potential hazards associated with a covered process.  The information is also essential for thorough completion of other RMP activities, such as Management of Change, Operating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations.\nThe PSI shall be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Safety Information Overview\nScott believes that complete and accurate written information concerning each RMP chemical, each RMP chemical process technology, and each RMP chemical process equipment is essential to an effective RMP Program.  \nThe purpose of the PSI Program is as follows:\n    To enable Scott personnel to identify and understand the hazards involved with the RMP chemicals;\n    To provide information for a complete and thorough PHA; \n    To support other RMP activities, such as Management of Change \nOperating Procedures, Training, and Incident Investigations; \n    To provide information on the hazards involved with ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide to Scott employees and contractors; and to document that the covered process systems are designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nToxic Gas Monitoring\nThe H Building, the enclosed areas in the H Building, the laboratory and the B Building are monitored with toxic gas monitors.  An MDA 7100 monitor, two MDA CM4 monitors, two System 16 monitors that continuously sample the air for hydrides, mineral acids, corrosives and chlorine.  A System 57 monitors the Laboratory also ammonia and flammables in the H bldg. These monitors will detect levels of ammonia, arsine, Boron trichlouride, chlorine, hydrogen and Nitric Oxide at different alarm levels\n\nFire Protection\nThe H Building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  The system was installed and is maintained in accordance with Uniform Fire Code requirements.\n\nOther Process Safety Information\nThe following information is contained in the Standard Operating Procedures:\n    Safe upper and lower limits for major process parameters;\n    Consequences of deviation from established safe limits; and\n    Safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.  In July and December 1999, personnel from Scott?s Fremont facility, and from Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California, conducted a PHAs of the containerized gas systems at the Fremont facility.  ERM facilitated the sessions while Scott team members, representing production, shipping, and management provided process information and expertise.\nThe containerized gas systems considered for the PHA included:  shipping and receiving; storage; and ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide transfilling/downfilling.  Because the systems are covered by the RMP standard, an initial PHA must be performed and recertified every 5 years.\n\nConducting the Process Hazard Analysis\nFor each ?What-if? question raised by the study team during the meetings, the team identified the current potential hazards, their consequences, severity, and likelihood of occurrence, as well as recommendations to reduce, eliminate, or control the hazards.  If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\nThe PHA addressed the following issues:\n1.   The potential hazards of the process.\n2.   The identification of any previous incidents that had a likely potential for consequences in the workplace.\n3.   Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the potential hazards.\n4.   Potential consequences in the event of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\nPHAs are required only for Program 3 covered processes.  PHAs were also conducted for the Program 2 covered processes (in lieu of simpler hazard reviews) due to the similarity of the processes and the ease of maintaining the PHA teams.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Overview\nThe Scott facility in Fremont, California has an ongoing program for accomplishing PHAs through this portion of the RMP Program.

If deemed appropriate, the potential hazards, consequences, and recommendations were recorded for a follow-up action.\n\nProgram 3 Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures for Program 3 covered processes must be available for the arsine and nitric oxide processes and must address the following elements:\n1. Steps for each operating phase:\n    Initial startup\n    Normal operations\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n2. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n3. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n    Precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment\n    Temporary operations\n    Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n    Emergency operations\n    Normal shutdown\n    Startup following a turn-around, or after an emergency shutdown\n4. Operating limits:\n    Consequences of deviation\n    Steps required to correct or avoid deviation\n5. Safety and health considerations:\n    Properties of, and hazards presented by, the regulated substances used in the process\n\nScott Operating Procedures\nAll ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide process operations at the Scott Fremont facility are governed, to some degree, by written Operating Procedures.  These Operating Procedures include guidance from the manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the specific process equipment.  All Operating Procedures have been and are developed through detailed discussion with operating personnel, who are considered a useful resource for practical job safety information.\nOperating Procedures are updated as necessary whenever there is a change in a covered process.  The Safety Manager oversees the development and revision of the Operating Procedures when process change occurs.  The Production Manual contains the most recent control versions of specific Operating Procedures.\nCurrent Operating Procedures are distributed to and maintained in the production area.  They are used as the basis for all new and updated operator training.  Operators and other personnel who could have an impact on the safety of covered processes, such as contractors, are trained on any revisions to Operating Procedures before changes are implemented.\n\nTRAINING\nProgram 3 Training Requirements\nEach employee involved in operating a Program 3 covered process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.  The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazard, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.\nRefresher training is required at least once every 3 years, or at any time the procedures are revised, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.\nA record of employee participation in the training program must be maintained.  Training documentation must include employee name, date of training, and the means used to verify the employee understood the training (e.g., oral or written exam).\n\nProgram 3 Mechanical Integrity Program Requirements\nThe Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program applies to the Boron Trichloride, Hydrogen Chlouride and nitric  oxide systems.  According to the CalARP RMP rule, the following process equipment must be included in a Program 3 Mechanical Integrity Program:\n    Pressure vessels and storage tanks;\n    Piping systems (including piping components such as valves);\n    Relief and vent systems and devices;\n    Emergency shutdown systems;\n    Controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks); and\n    Pumps.\nIn general, the Mechanical Integrity program must incorporate the following:\n1. Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, including periodic maintenance, inspection, testing, and servicing procedures as further outlined below:\n    Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and \nemployee training is to identify process hazards and determine how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  For contractors hired to do maintenance on a Program 2 CalARP RMP covered process, Scott must ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures.  The maintenance program procedures were most recently reviewed in July 1999.\n\nManagement of Change Procedure\nThe Management of Change procedure is documented in the PSM Manual.  The procedure meets all of the requirements of the CalARP RMP Section 2760.6.  The Safety Manager is responsible for updating and implementing the Management of Change program.  \nThe Management of Change documentation will be maintained in Central Files, in the Management of Change file with appropriate, associated documentation, including, but not limited to:\n     Safety Review Checklists,\n     PHA documents, and\n     Training documentation.\n\nScott Compliance Audit Program\nScott has developed an organized and well-documented compliance audit program.  Responsibility for the compliance audit has been assigned to the Safety Manager, who may delegate specific responsibilities and select an audit team, as appropriate.  The audit begins with a kick-off meeting for all involved with RMP management.  Then, each element of the RMP is assessed through employee interviews, review of records, and selected field observations.  \nAfter the compliance audit, draft and final reports are issued.  All responsible personnel receive copies and are expected to respond to the list of findings.  The Safety Manager, through the RMP Committee, coordinates follow-up on all findings and responses.  The Safety Manager maintains reports and records of response to findings.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure \nIncidents should be investigated by the Plant Manager, by the Production Supervisor or designated representative, and other trained plant personnel as needed.  At least one person knowledgeable about the process should be included on the investigation team and a contractor employee must be included if the incident involved the work of a contractor.\nThe incident investigation facts should be reviewed by the Plant Manager or designated representative, and a cause of the event should be determined and specific actions should be recommended to prevent a reoccurrence.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report must be completed within 5 working days of the incident.\nThe Production Supervisor shall submit the Incident Investigation Summary Report to appropriate management personnel for their review/approval.\nThe Incident Investigation Summary Report will include the following\n     Date and time of the incident;\n     Date the inspection began;\n     Description of the incident;\n     The factors that contributed to the incident;\n     How the incident could have been prevented; and\n     Any recommendations resulting from the investigation, individual(s) accountable for resolution, target date(s), and completion date(s).\nCorrective action and means of resolution developed from the incident investigation must be documented in the Incident Investigation Summary Report.  The most recent incident investigation resulted from an incident that occurred on 15 February 2001.  No procedural changes\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\nThe primary mechanism for employee involvement and awareness is through the RMP Committee, which is described in Section 2, Management System.  The RMP Committee ensures senior management as well as employee involvement in overseeing and implementing RMP activities.  Department managers have responsibilities for performing specific RMP activities, as outlined in Section 2.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\nThe full description of Scott?s Hot Work Permit issuance procedures is included in the facility?s PSM Manual.  The program meets all of the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.11.  The Safety Manager has responsibility for implementing and updating the Hot Work Permit program.\n\nScott Contractors Program Scott has a comprehensive contractor control program, which begins with the initial screening of contractors.  Responsibilities are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The main points of the Scott contractors program are summarized here.\n     All Requests for Contracts by Scott departments identify work to be performed on or near processes involving arsine or nitric oxide.\n     All Request for Bid packages require contractor submission of information on the contractor?s safety record, safety program, and  relevant experience and qualifications.  The contractor must be pre-qualified prior to being approved for work.\n     The Scott Supervisor requesting the contract work is designated as the Contractor Supervisor for the requested work.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor participates in the contractor selection process.\n     All new contractor employees receive orientation on facility safety procedures.\n     Contractor employees sign in and out each day.\n     The Scott Contractor Supervisor conducts daily evaluations of contractor employee work.\n     The Contractor Supervisor conducts meetings at the start of each contractor work shift to review work activities to be conducted and work permits needed.  \n     Documentation is maintained of orientations, evaluations, and other pertinent information.\nThe detailed Contractor Program for arsine and nitric oxide is maintained in the PSM Manual.  The Program meets all the requirements of CalARP Section 2760.12.  The Contractor Program was most recently updated in December 1999.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR CALARP RMP CHEMICALS\nEmergency Situations\nThe EPRP will be activated in the following emergency situations:\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals that trigger the sensors and alarms; and\n     Releases of the RMP chemicals with the potential to harm human health or  the environment.\nReporting Emergency Situations\nAny Scott employee or contractor employee may report an emergency situation.  All personnel are encouraged to notify any supervisor when they know or suspect that a release of any hazardous chemical has occurred at the facility.  When contacting the supervisor, personnel should provide as much information as possible regarding the known or suspected situation.  If a supervisor is not immediately available, the employee may activate the toxic release alarm and evacuate the building",

The legal authority for the CalARP Program is the California Health and Safety Code (H&SC), Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2 (commencing with Section 25531).  The California Office of Emergency Services has issued implementation regulations under the California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  Scott Semiconductor Gases (Scott) is regulated under the CalARP Program, due to on-site storage of six chemicals that exceed the RMP applicability threshold in a process.  A process is defined as ?any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\n\n?Facility\nScott is located at 5121 Brandin Court in Fremont, California (see Figure ES-1, Site Location Map).  The facility is comprised of two buildings.  The H Building is used for compressed gas cylinder storage and gas processing.  The B Building houses the administration offices, the laboratory, a clean room, and additional inert compressed gas cylinder storage.\n\nChemical Inventories\nThe chemicals at Scott that exceed the RMP applicability threshold are ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide.

The release is assumed to occur while the cylinder is in the H- Building storage area.  The entire quantity is assumed to be released over a period of 10 minutes.  The release rate to the atmosphere is the quantity contained in the cylinder divided by the duration of the release.  A summary of the worst-case release scenarios is provided in this RMP report.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for each RMP process is assumed to be a failure of a valve on or a connection to a cylinder containing the greatest quantity of the compressed gas.  The release is assumed to occur while the cylinder is inside the storage and processing building, where the doors would be closed in the event of a leak.  It is estimated that the release could be stopped within 15 minutes of occurrence; however, it is likely that the entire quantity of compressed gas in the cylinder would be released before the release could be stopped.  Therefore, the release rate to the atmosphere is the quantity contained in the cylinder divided by the duration of the release, adjusted to account for the mitigation provided by the enclosed building.
