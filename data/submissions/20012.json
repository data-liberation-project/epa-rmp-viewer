USEPA requires companies to use models for  \u0013worst-case\u0014 and \u0013alternate\u0014 release scenarios for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur. If a release occurred, however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.  \n\nThe ammonia release scenario was modeled using SLAB (June 1990 version) to obtain the distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint. The Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2, ERPG-2, was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  It refers to the level of ammonia that individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without being subjected to irreversible or other serious health effects that could make it difficult for them to leave the affected area.\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n                                                                                                                                                                             This facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for its ammonia refrigeration program.  There are several key aspects of the prevention program:\n\n1. Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\n\n2. There is a plant-wide ammonia detection system which alerts the utility personnel and security area personnel, and both of these areas are staffed continuously.\n\n3. Most of the ammonia pipe work is located away from employee traffic"

It also deals with training for plant personnel who respond to spills and leaks anywhere on site.\n  \n The purpose of the SPCC document is to also establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the LEPC and the Avon Fire Department) and company personnel in the event of an emergency.  It includes planning for potential spills and the appropriate responses and countermeasures.\n \n Our"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY for AVON:\n\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Avon, New York, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia). This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system. This  system uses a real time data base to track preventive maintenance, training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Avon, New York Fire Department and the Livingston County, New York Emergency Planning  Committee, in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nKraft manufactures frozen whipped toppings and lunch combination products at the Avon, NY, plant.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the  primary process at this facility is 311991. Kraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Avon, NY,  plant -- ammonia. The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\n\nThe  ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 95,000 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989. Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause  burns. The potential risks"
