      "SummaryText": "The PES Woodbine facility consists of two operating units:  Pathfinder and Peachtree.  The Woodbine facility is located on a 24-acre site in Kingsland, Georgia.  Pathfinder produces two tons of compressed gaseous hydrogen per day using a 5-MW Electrolyzer skid with the hydrogen stored and shipped in Department of Transportation (DOT) compressed gas tube trailers.  The Peachtree unit was completed in 2023, produces cryogenic (liquified) hydrogen which is stored in two 90,000-gallon cryogenic tanks.  Liquid hydrogen is shipped in MC-338 cargo tanks.  Hydrogen processing is scheduled for a 24 hour/365 day a year operation. The facility employees approximately 20 individuals. A minimum of one board (console) operator and a field technician (operator) are on each shift.\n\nThe Pathfinder operating unit utilizes electric current to break the hydrogen-oxygen bonds in water to produce hydrogen with oxygen as a byproduct.  The unit is designed to produce 99.999% pure hydrogen at a pressure less than 580 psig.  The main process components are:\n\u0095\tWater purification and deionization\n\u0095\tRectifier (converts AC power to DC power used by Electrolyzer)\n\u0095\tElectrolyzers\n\u0095\tHydrogen dryer system\n\u0095\tHydrogen buffer tank\n\u0095\tHydrogen compression system\n\u0095\tNitrogen system\n\u0095\tCooling tower and pump system\n\u0095\tUtilities such as instrument air and nitrogen\n\nThe Peachtree operating unit utilizes a similar process to Pathfinder with the exception the hydrogen is liquified and transported to customers in cargo tanks.  The main process components for liquid hydrogen production are:\n\u0095\tWater purification and deionization\n\u0095\tRectifier (converts AC power to DC power to be used by the Electrolyzer)\n\u0095\tElectrolyzers\n\u0095\tDe-oxygenation (Deoxo)/Dryer System\n\u0095\tHydrogen buffer tank\n\u0095\tHydrogen liquefier with recycle compressors (x4)\n\u0095\tNitrogen re-liquefier with liquid storage and recycle compressor.\n\u0095\tHelium liquid storage and compressors\n\u0095\tLiquid hydrogen storage tank & offloading\n\u0095\tCooling tower and pump system\n\u0095\tUtili"

Hydrogen is cooled and liquified for storage at a temperature of -421\u00b0F and 5 psig via heat exchange with nitrogen and helium compression and expansion cycles. A series of Ortho-Para conversion reactors are included in the liquefier system to achieve a concentration of approximately 95% para-hydrogen and 5% ortho-hydrogen, which will minimize boil-off of product hydrogen.\n\nLiquid hydrogen in the Peachtree unit is stored in two (2) 90,000-gallon horizontal storage tanks (phase 1 only). The tanks are vacuum jacketed and include a boil-off vapor collection system. Product hydrogen will be loaded into tanker trucks via loading bays present at the site.\n\nHydrogen storage tanks are constructed with the liquid hydrogen tank suspended in a vacuum casing.  There is an evacuation valve on the tank.\n\u0095\tThe liquid tank is wrapped with insulation material.  \n\u0095\tThe space between the liquid tank and the casing (outer shell) is evacuated (vacuum), filled with an adsorbent (perlite) to help maintain a vacuum, and sealed.\n\u0095\tGas and liquid hydrogen piping pass through the ends of the casing. \n\u0095\tThe casing is protected from over pressurization with a rupture disk in the event of a leak from the liquid container into the annular space.\n\u0095\tThe inner liquid container is protected by dual relief valves and a rupture disk.\n\nThe bulk liquid gas storage tanks are monitored by various methods:  overfill alarms that provides the liquid weight in the tank, and hand gauged.  All tanks during loading are manually checked every 30 minutes, which prevents the overfilling of tanks.  When tanks are to be filled to or near capacity, a loader is stationed at the tank during top-off. \n\nPlug Power Woodbine facility pipelines are supported on pipe standards to permit visual inspection for leaks"
