Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nChelan Fruit Cooperative, (hereafter referred to as CFC) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n    CFC refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\n\nAt CFC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n?    Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n?    Reduce the threat to our personnel\n?    Reduce the threat to the community\n\n\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nCFC is a group of fruit processing and cold storage facilities, located near the city of Chelan, county of Chelan, city of Pateros / Brewster and Okanogan, county of Okanogan, state of Washington.\n\nThe regulated substance used at CFC is anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7).\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used a"

The largest interconnected\nsystem could potentially release 12,000 pounds of product.\n\nThere is approximately 23,215 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Brewster\nsystems.  The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room\n1 and #2, and potentially release 8,570 pounds of product.\n\nThere is approximately 17,655 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Pateros North \nsystem. The larger of the two independent systems ( South Engine Room ) could\npotentially release 10,009 pounds of product.\nThere  is  approximately  2,169 pounds  of  anhydrous ammonia  in the Pateros\nSouth system. The quantities present at this location are well below the 10,000\npound threshold and therefore does not require a RMP.  As such, Worst Case and\nAlternative Scenarios were not calculated.  If in the future this location increases it?s\ncapacity to the 10,000 threshold an amended RMP will be immediately submitted. \nIn order to provide the Pateros South facility and the surrounding area a higher \nlevel of safety, most components of this RMP and related PSM are applied to the\nPateros South facility.\n\nThere is approximately 23,827 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Okanogan\nsystems. The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room\n`C? and `D? and release 7,640 pounds of product.   \n\nCFC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, CFC believes in the concept set forth in the ?General Duty Clause? of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, CFC has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n\nC.  Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as ?worst case? and ?alternative? scenarios."

This is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that CFC, located at Bldg #5, Highway 150, Chelan, WA, is complying with Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs deal with the risks involved in the storage, handling, and processing of highly hazardous materials such as ammonia.  In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\n2.    CFC?s PSM/RMP programs enable our facility to mitigate the occurrence and consequences of significant releases of hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of incidents.  \n\n3.    CFC?s PSM/RMP programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to all appropriate employees at CFC.\n\n4.    Copies of the written program may be reviewed in the refrigeration or Human Resources Offices. \n\n5.    If an employee (or any reader of this document) feel that any improvements can be made to the PSM / RMP programs, please contact Greg Townsend and present your written suggestion. CFC encourages all suggestions because we are committed to the success of our PSM / RMP programs. CFC striv"

At 50,000 ppm death is immediate.  Ammonia?s ability to bond with water destroys any human tissue (since all tissue has moisture).\n\nIncompatibilities and Reactivates\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is incompatible with:  acids; aldehydes; amides, halogens, heavy metals, oxidizers, plastics, and sulfur.\n\nAt CFC, the ammonia is used in a closed system, so the threat of ammonia mixing with an incompatible material is minimal.  It is important to keep potential incompatible materials away from areas that have the highest potential of a release, such as pressure relief devices.\n\nAmmonia is stable and hazardous polymerization will not occur.\n\nCorrosiveness\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is corrosive to certain materials, including brass, bronze, copper, cuprous nickel, nickel copper, phosphor bronze, tin, and zinc.

Since ammonia is the only substance on site in excess of the threshold, only one worst-case scenario was performed.  \n\nThe quantity calculated for Chelan was the amount in the largest vessel, as required by 40 CFR 68.25(e), which is the high-pressure receiver.  The dimensions of the receiver are 4.5? in circumference and 20? in length, giving the receiver a volume of 318 cubic feet.  The amount of ammonia possible, if the vessel were to be filled to 100% capacity at 85 degrees F is 11,845 pounds. (Based on the weight of liquid ammonia at 85o F, which is 37.25 pounds per cubic foot.)  Since there is connecting piping to the receiver containing liquid ammonia, the actual amount used in modeling the worst-case release was 12,000 pounds.  Also, there are no administrative controls or passive mitigation used in this scenario to mitigate the effects of the release. The distance to the toxic end-point, of 1.8 mile, was obtained by use of RMP-COMP, version 1.06.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis (68.28)\n\nRMP regulations require that at least one alternative scenario be identified and analysis for each regulated substance, at each location.  Since ammonia is the only regulated substance in excess of the threshold, only one alternative scenario was selected.  The scenario used was a release from a short pipe (.75? diameter) at the bottom of the receiver (the drain).  Of the alternative scenarios looked at, this scenario gave the greatest risk radius for the alternative release.\n\nUsing ALOHA?, the modeling analysis was based on the high-pressure receiver being filled with 30% liquid at 85o F, which is the normal operating situation.

Refrigeration employees who are expected to respond to a minor release of NH3 shall receive training in the hazards of ammonia, proper Personal Protective Equipment  ( PPE ) selection and how to identify and respond to minor releases commensurate with 29 CFR 1910.120 (e) HAZWOPER.\n\n2.    Employees who are expected to respond to any NH3 release, other than a minor release, shall receive training in accordance with WAC 296-62-3112, appropriate and required for their particular level of involvement.\n\n3.
