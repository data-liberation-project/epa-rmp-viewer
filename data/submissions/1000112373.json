(NuStar) is committed to the safety of our employees, surrounding community, and the environment and the Wolsey, SD. Terminal achieved OSHA VPP Star status on September 3, 2015 and recertified on March 12, 2019. It is NuStar\u0092s policy to comply with all federal, state, and local laws as well as accepted industry practice for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, butane, propane and other liquefied petroleum gases. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nII.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThe Wolsey Terminal was built and put into service in the mid 1960\u0092s. The facility was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 6\u0094 pipeline, to the Wolsey Terminal from the NuStar Terminal in Yankton, SD. The 3,944,068 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of ten, pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is stored in one pressurized bullet tank and is routed through a Depropanizer distillation process, which removes any excess propane from the LM and this propane is then stored in the propane bullet tanks with the good propane. The propane is then removed from the site by propane trucks that deliver it to various customers. The refined products are also stored in tanks and pumped to various customers by trucks.\n\nIII.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. The NuStar Wolsey, SD. Terminal will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements. \n\u0095\tTra"

Employee training includes participation in internal response drills with government agencies and local Fire Departments. Employees are trained and must demonstrate an understanding of the required task before being allowed to handle any RMP regulated substances. \n\u0095\tSafety Equipment: Describe the safety system around the regulated substance. \n\u0095\tFacility Design: The anhydrous ammonia, butane, propane handling facility has been designed to meet the standards set forth in NFPA 58 and is operated in compliance with the OSHA standard for the storage and handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (29 CFR 1910.110) \nIV.\tFive-year Accident History \nThe NuStar Wolsey, SD. Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. There has been no accidental release of a regulated substance, meeting the RMP five-year accident history reporting criteria, in the past five years. \nV.\tEmergency Response Information\nThe NuStar Wolsey, SD. Terminal has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on factors such as modifications made to the process or changes in the communication procedures. \nVI.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nThe NuStar Wolsey, SD. Terminal will continue to improve employee training resources, conduct safety audits, and incident investigations, as applicable, to continuously improve worker and public safety. The terminal will also continue to actively manage changes to facilities, process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment, as well as to review and revise operating, maintenance, emergency, and communication procedures to ensure that they reflect current operating practices.
