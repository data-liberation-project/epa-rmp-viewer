The facility does not have an on-site fire brigade. \n\nThe site is limited to the storage of 20 - 30,000 gallon capacity railcars. All movement of cars and maintenance and inspections are conducted by Vermont Rail.\n\nThe site has never had an accident at this location involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Danby, VT Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. Irving has trained Propane subject-matter experts within the company that can provide technical assistance to the Incident Commander. Vermont Rail has coordinated our response plans with the fire department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
