The first reportable release occurred on August 9th at 5:30 PM.  A small intermittent fire was discovered approximately 2 hours after H-805 had been shutdown.  Crude oil was allowed to continue circulating through the heater coils while it cooled.  At 5:25, the snuffing steam to the firebox was turned off in order to prepare the line for blinding by maintenance.  Three to five minutes afterward, a detonation and ensuing fire took place within H-805.  The operator extinguished the flames and ERT was activated.  No injuries occurred due to this incident.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nParamount Petroleum is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for its employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The prevention of accidents, injuries, fires, emergency releases and other emergency situations is of utmost importance and shall be the first priority for all persons working at the refinery. \nIt is anticipated that accidents, injuries and emergency situations may still occur. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) will provide guidelines for a coordinated emergency management system in the refinery to respond to such situations.  The ERP utilizes proven techniques of the Incident Command System.  When situations dictate, the system will utilize the combined effort from all departments, mutual aid groups and municipal agencies in order to mitigate emergency incidents in a safe, effective and timely manner.  The ERP includes:\n\u00bf\tEmergency Alarm Procedures\n\u00bf\tEvacuation Procedures\n\u00bf\tSafety and Health Considerations\n\u00bf\tNotification Procedures\nThe ERP is implemented through an Incident Command System (ICS).

The Shift Incident Commander also coordinates with the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) via telephone. \nFor larger emergencies the Director of Safety and Process Safety Management serves as the Incident Commander. An Emergency Management Team (EMT) may also be activated to assist, which is lead by the Vice President of Refining.  Other members of the EMT are members of the refinery senior management. The ERT, which may have initially responded to the emergency, relinquishes incident management to the Director of Safety and Process Safety Management when the latter assumes command and then provides support to the EMT. The Director of Safety and Process Safety Management communicates with the LACoFD and other outside agencies by telephone.  Refinery personnel assigned to ERT or EMT responsibilities receive continued training.  \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nParamount has a tracking system for implementing recommendations that result from Process Hazard Analyses. There is a continuing training and certification program in place. \nSEISMIC ASSESSMENT\nA seismic assessment of equipment covered processes was performed in 1999 in accordance with the seismic design requirements.  An additional evaluation was completed in 2004 for selected process equipment to conform with new CalARP guidelines in 2000. Processes being placed back in service and the new Penex Plus Unit had a seismic evaluation conducted in late 2004 and early 2005 as the processes were prepared for inspection.  The most recent seismic assessment was completed for #1 HDS Unit and the walk-down was performed in January 2009."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPPC - Paramount Refinery is located at 14700 Downey Avenue, Paramount, California. The Refinery occupies approximately 63 acres of land located in the city of Paramount in Southern California. The site is bordered on the north by Contreras Street, on the south by Somerset Boulevard and Southern Pacific Railroad track, on the east by Lakewood Boulevard and on the west by Downey Avenue. On the north side of the refinery, a trailer park, a shopping center, Wirtz Elementary School and single-family houses are located. On the west side, Paramount High School and a housing development are located. On the east side, there are single-family homes and mobile home development.  Across the railroad tracks on the south side is an apartment complex. \nThe primary business of the Paramount Refinery is the processing of local crude oils to finished hydrocarbon products, primarily asphalts for road construction and roofing materials, as well as reformulated gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD).  The present rated capacity of the refinery is 55 KBPD of crude.\nThe facility has developed a risk management program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785) as well as the EPA RMP requirements (40 CFR Part 68).  PPC - Paramount Refinery is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The PPC - Paramount Refinery staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia to reduce NOx emissions and refining petroleum.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nPPC - Paramount Refinery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, oper"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  \nPPC \u00bf Paramount Refinery\u00bfs the Prevention Program 3 elements for flammable substances include:\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\n\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit\n\u00bf\tContractors\n\u00bf\tEmergency Planning & Response\n\u00bf\tTrade Secrets\nOrganization Responsibility and Authority\nAll employees are equally responsible for ensuring the health and safety of themselves and others in the facility.\nManagement, however, by law and practice, is responsible for ensuring that employees are trained to safely perform their jobs.
