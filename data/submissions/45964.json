The observes safety precautions in handling ammonia to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment, and adheres to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner in which the facility handles ammonia, the safety devces inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Valdosta Fire Department. This includes procedures for notifing the Fire Departmemnt in the event of an incident involving ammonia.\n\nb. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility consists of a cotton seed delinting plant, a oilseed processing plant, a vegetable oil refinery, a refined oils packaging and a trucking operation.\n\nc. Accident Release Prevention\n\nThe concepts used in this facility's prevention program are the elements of the Process Safety Management Program: employee participation, process safety information, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe working pracitices, personnel training, contractor programs, pre-startup reviews, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, hot work permit procedures, incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.\n\nd. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility had one reportable release in the past five years which was triggered by a combination of equipment failure and a lack of applicable maintenance procedure. The release was over an extended period of time which created no adverse effects on the environment or personnel in the area. As a result of this incident, the facility has repaired or replaced the faulty equipment and created procedures to prevent this type of incident from recurring.\n\ne.

Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of our continued safety review of the facility's ammonia refrigeration system, this facility has added an ammonia detection and alarm system. The level of training has been improved to include a course in general refrigeration, coupled with specific equipment and emergency response. The facility is planning on removing the quench pots from the pressure relief systems, removing possible back pressure on the system."
