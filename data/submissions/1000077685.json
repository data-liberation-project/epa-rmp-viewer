This successful operating record is due to the City's commitment to ongoing training programs, operating procedures, and computer-generated maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and the Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe City of Lincoln operates a water treatment facility in Ashland, Nebraska.  The facility uses chlorine to reduce the pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and viruses in potable water to less than the maximum contaminant levels set forth in the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n\n\nChlorine utilized in the disinfection process arrives at the facility in one ton containers that are stored in a ventilated building equipped with leak detection devices and an air scrubber unit.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the facility is 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario were assessed for the chlorine process.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-cast scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The worst-case scenario allows consideration of passive mitigation measures.  The worst-case release scenario for the chlorine process was determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).\n\n\n\nThe alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\"  The alternative release scenario for the chlorine process was determined in accordance with the guidelines in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.  Active mitigation measures, as well as passive mitigation measures, can be used in determining the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nAccording to EPA, the toxic endpoint for chlorine has been "

An airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoints is the maximum airborne concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.\n\n\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly overestimates the population potentially exposed to a chlorine release because the chlorine plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the prominent winds.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nFor the chlorine process at the Ashland WTF, the worst-case release results from a one-ton chlorine cylinder (maximum amount held in a single vessel) rupturing when unloaded from the delivery truck and its contents escaping to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  In the event the cylinder would release its entire contents to the atmosphere in 10 minutes, the release rate would be 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint worst-case release distance, 1.3 miles, was taken from Exhibit 4-3 of the EPSA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, for an urban setting.\n\n\n\nThe residential population within the 1.3 miles was determined to be approximately 1905 people.  The population was calculated by utilizing the U.S. Department of Commerce software package Circular Profiling System, which sums 2010 population information from the Census Bureau for areas within the 1.3-mile radius impact zone.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario, or scenario more likely to result in a release, involves a failure of"

It is assumed that the air scrubber turns on at 3 ppm chlorine, which discharges 5 ppm chlorine at a rate of 500 cfm.  This results in a release rate of less than 0.1 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint alternative release distance, less than 0.10 miles, was taken from Exhibit 4-15 of the EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, for an urban setting.\n\n\n\nThe residential population within the 0.10-mile radius of influence was determined to be 0 people.

The City will continuously evaluate and update their safety and prevention procedures as needed.  The City conducted a process hazard review for the process determined to be A?coveredA?, the chlorine process, as part of the development of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Ashland WTF in the previous five years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program established by the City of Lincoln for the Ashland WTF does not require personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The local emergency response agencies will be relied upon for coordinating all response actions resulting from the release and for informing the public about the release.
