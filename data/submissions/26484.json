If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any releases to the population and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information: B. V.-82 has no full time employee.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilzer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmers.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility is approximately 407,600-pounds.  This amount includes our main storage tank and nurse tanks.  During periods of non operation, of this faciliy, local law enforcement conducts inspections at various times of the day and nights, through the year.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our main storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles.\n\n4. Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative-case release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the Standard of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facilty, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offs"

Planned Changes To Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess our prevention and safety programs.  No changes are planned at this time.\n\n9.  For additional information contact:\n\nMr. Gary L. Choat\n3373 State Highway 39\nSt. Edward, NE  68660\n(402) 678 2457"
