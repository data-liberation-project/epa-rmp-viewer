This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes procedures for the operation, maintenance, emergency response, and employee training associated with the regulated process at this facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nThe City of Ridgeland operates a water supply well located on Old Canton Road in Ridgeland, Mississippi.  The city utilizes two (2) one-ton cylinders of chlorine to disinfect water prior to distribution of the water to end users.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Old Canton Road water well involves the catastrophic release of a full one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The potential radius of impact was estimated by RMP*Comp to be approximately 1.3 miles.  The likelihood of this type of release is extremely small.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated for the Old Canton Road water well involves the release of chlorine from a disconnected transfer hose. The potential radius of impact was estimated by RMP*Comp to be approximately 0.1 miles.\n\nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases resulting in significant onsite or off-site impacts have occurred at the Old Canton Road water well.  In the event of an accidental release of chlorine from the site, the City of Ridgeland Fire Department would be notified immediately to respond.  The Fire Department has experienced personnel trained to mitigate such situations."
