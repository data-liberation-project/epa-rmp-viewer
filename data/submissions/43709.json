The 20-minute release period used for this calculation corresponds to the averaging time for the ERPG-2 concentration that EPA used as the basis for the Toxic Endpoint.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the impact of this hypothetical release, Kimberly-Clark used RMP* Comp Ver. 1.07 \r\nto model the sulfur dioxide plume that traveled 0.1 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  The plume barely extends beyond Kimberly-Clark site boundaries to encompass a portion of W. Marine View Drive.  The plume does not reach residential areas.  \r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario:  Aqueous Chlorine Dioxide Solution  \r\n\r\nChilled, aqueous chlorine dioxide is stored in two above-ground tanks inside a secondary containment dike.  Kimberly-Clark\u00bfs safety review team selected the following hypothetical accident as the Alternate Release Scenario: 1,000 gallons of solution spills from a broken fitting into the secondary containment.  After the spill is stopped, the solution accumulated in the secondary containment is manually drained to the mill\u00bfs closed sewer system and routed to the mill\u00bfs wastewater treatment plant.  \r\n\r\nEPA\u00bfs WATER8 emission model was used to calculate the amount of chlorine dioxide that would volatilize as the solution spilled into the containment dike.  WATER8 was also used to calculate the amount of chlorine dioxide that would volatilize from the sewer system and the wastewater treatment plant.  Of the 84 pounds of chlorine dioxide in the original 1,000-gallon spill, an estimated 22 pounds would volatilize and disperse downwind in the first 20 minutes.  \r\n\r\nEPA\u00bfs RMP* Comp Ver. 1.07 model was used to estimate the distance that the chlorine dioxide would blow downwind before it dispersed to EPA\u00bfs toxic endpoint concentration of 1 ppm.  The EPA defaults for wind speed of 3 meters/second and D stability were used in the model.  RMP* Comp estimated a distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint, which barely extends beyond the nearest plant boundary.\r\n\r\nA"

      "SummaryText": "lternate Release Scenario: Anhydrous Ammonia \r\n\r\nKimberly-Clark\u00bfs safety review team evaluated a wide range of hypothetical events, and selected the following scenario to represent releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is imported to the facility in rail cars.  A gasket on the unloading rack between the rail car and Kimberly-Clark\u00bfs process line develops a small leak (assumed to be a 1/8-inch wide split).  The leaking gasket is exposed to liquid ammonia at a pressure of 120 psig, which results in a release of ammonia droplets.  An ammonia monitor at the unloading station would detect the leak and automatically alert the control room, which would dispatch the mill\u00bfs HazMat team to the unloading area to repair the leak.\r\n\r\nThe TANKLEAK emission module of the AIRTOX model was used to calculate the ammonia emission rate.  Based on an assumed 1/8-inch hole size and a system pressure of 120 psig the calculated release rate is 2.5 gallons per minute (13 pounds per minute). \r\n\r\nThe Alternate Release Scenario ammonia plume was modeled with RMP* Comp Ver. 1.07 (3.0 meters/second and D stability) to travel 0.1 miles before it dispersed to the 200 ppm Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  The plume barely extends beyond the nearest plant boundary.    \r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario: Aqueous Ammonia Solution\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is manufactured onsite by blending anhydrous ammonia with water to a solution strength of 20%, cooling the solution in a heat exchanger, and storing the solution in a large storage tank.  A gasket on the heat exchanger processing 20% ammonia solution develops a small leak (assumed to be 1/8 inch diameter).  Equations from EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\u00bf were used to estimate the leakage flow rate.  At the 25-30 psig working pressure, the 1/8-inch gasket leak would cause a leakage flow rate of 2 gallons per minute of aqueous solution (4 pounds per minute of ammonia).  Using RMP* Comp Ver. 1.07, it was estimated that 60 pounds released"

Based on \u00bfUrban\u00bf surface roughness, 3.0 meters/second and D stability, the model predicts that the ammonia cloud would travel less than 0.1 miles before dispersing to the 200 ppm toxic endpoint concentration.

This Executive Summary is provided to demonstrate Kimberly-Clark\u00bfs continuing commitment to run an operation in Everett that is safe both to its employees and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\n\r\n5-year Anniversary Date Revision\r\n\r\nThis revised RMP is submitted for the 5-year anniversary date of the last RMP plan submission on 08/04/2000.  Kimberly-Clark Everett has had no major changes to the RMP covered chemical systems since the last plan submission.  This re-submitted plan includes updated dates for items in our prevention program and population updates in our hypothetical accidental releases of chlorine dioxide, anhydrous liquid sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia.    \r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Kimberly-Clark (K-C) Everett mill consists of a 500 air dried metric ton ammonium based sulfite pulp mill, a bleach plant, two pulp drying machines, and five paper machines.  The pulp mill was built in the 1930s and was owned by the Soundview Pulp Company until the early 1950s, when it was purchased by Scott Paper Company.  Scott Paper added paper machines and owned the operation until it merged with Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1995.\r\n\r\nIn the sulfite pulping operation, softwood and hardwood chips are cooked in batch digesters utilizing ammonium bisulfite cooking acid prepared on site.  The cooking separates the pulp fibers from the binding material (lignin) which holds them together.  To prepare the cooking acid, sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) is mixed with an aqueous solution of ammonia (NH3).\r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide is primarily generated by burning elemental sulfur, but is also reclaimed from the recovery boiler flue gas.

This purchased \u00bfliquid SO2\u00bf is brought in by truck and stored in two 100-ton tanks located inside the pulp digester building.  This quantity of SO2 is above the 5,000 pound threshold for the Risk Management Program; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia is brought to the site in anhydrous form via 80 ton rail cars.  This quantity exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold for anhydrous ammonia; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia is pumped from the rail cars and diluted with water prior to storage in a 150,000 gallon tank.  The aqueous ammonia is stored at approximately 20% strength; this quantity stored exceeds the 20,000 pound RMP threshold for aqueous ammonia, so aqueous ammonia is also subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia solution is employed on site not only to prepare the cooking acid, but also for pollution control: it is used as a reactant in the sulfite recovery boiler to remove nitrogen oxides from air emissions, and it is used in the mill's secondary wastewater treatment plant to provide the nutrients needed for proper operation.  It is also used to buffer concentrated spent sulfite liquor prior to storage. \r\n\r\nPulp leaving the digesters is transported to three counter-current pressure washers; weak spent sulfite liquor from the washers is transported to multiple effect evaporators where it is concentrated.  The concentrated sulfite liquor is then burned in the sulfite recovery boiler to generate steam.  \r\n\r\nAfter washing, the sulfite pulp is bleached.  The bleaching system, described in the plan submitted to EPA in August 2000, utilizes three bleaching stages: chlorine dioxide, caustic extraction with oxygen and peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  \r\n\r\nThe chlorine dioxide solution is manufactured at the mill via the Solvay process.  In this process, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide are mixed in a primary re"

The primary reactor underflows to a smaller secondary reactor where additional hydrogen peroxide and bubbled air are added to drive the reaction to its conclusion.  The chlorine dioxide gas is collected in the vapor space of the reactor vessel and transferred to an absorption tower.  In this tower chilled water is introduced to absorb the chlorine dioxide, forming a solution containing 8 to 14 grams per liter (approximately 1% ClO2).  The chlorine dioxide solution is then transferred to 50,000 gallon storage tanks of 1% chlorine dioxide solution for use in the bleaching process.  Each tank contains up to 5,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  As this quantity exceeds the 1,000 pound RMP reporting threshold, chlorine dioxide is subject to the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nKimberly-Clark\u00bfs Safety Program\r\n\r\nWe at Kimberly-Clark view safety as the most important aspect of our operations.  Consequently, not only what we do, but also how we do it is of utmost importance; this world-class safety philosophy extends to all facets of our operations.   Over the past five years, there have been no deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or environmental damage caused by accidental releases from RMP covered processes. \r\n\r\nThe facility employs a two full time Safety Managers and three four environmental professionals.  An environmental engineer monitors the Process Safety and Risk Management programs, ensuring the elements of these programs as listed below are properly executed.  In addition, the mill maintains an emergency response (HazMat) team staffed with trained individuals; this team is available 24 hours a day.  The HazMat team conducts drills to respond to simulated chemical accidents.  A plant health and safety committee, composed of represent"

As a result: 1) The chemical feeds will stop.  2) The dilution air will be diverted from the bottom of the reactor to the gas phase.  This will stop the stripping of chlorine dioxide, will purge the ClO2 and decomposition products from the reactor, and will cool the gas space and gas lines.  3) The generator cannot be restarted until the gas temperature falls below the critical set point.\r\n\r\n* The mill\u00bfs process control system is used to control the ClO2 process.

K-C has provided the county \u00bf911\u00bf system with an Emergency Alert System (EAS) whereby citizens can be advised of a problem and given directions via \u00bfEmergency Broadcast System\u00bf interruption of radio and television transmissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps To Improve Safety\r\n\r\nKimberly-Clark has completed the following steps to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases, and to minimize the impacts of releases that could conceivably occur.\r\n\r\n* Elimination of Methanol in Chlorine Dioxide production.  Kimberly-Clark switched from methanol, sodium chlorate, and sulfuric acid for production of chlorine dioxide to hydrogen peroxide, sodium chlorate, and sulfuric acid.  This eliminated the import, storage, and use of methanol at the mill.  The dilute aqueous chlorine dioxide solution is essentially used as it is generated, keeping the quantity stored low and greatly reducing risks to the surrounding community.  \r\n\r\n* Improved Traffic Barriers.  Kimberly-Clark evaluated potential traffic accidents that could damage piping containing aqueous ammonia solution, and installed new traffic barriers at some locations.  After installation of the barriers, there is no realistic likelihood of a traffic accident causing damage to process piping at the ammonia system.  \r\n\r\n* Enclosure of Liquid Sulfur Dioxide Tanks.  The two liquid SO2 tanks are located inside the pulp digester building.  Historically the end of the building containing the tanks was open to the atmosphere.  Large building doors were refurbished and are now kept shut thus enclosing the tanks, which reduces significantly the distance any release would travel. \r\n\r\n* Community Cooperation.

However, since such a release could impact industries, commercial areas, and residential areas, Kimberly-Clark is working with the Snohomish County Local Emergency Planning Committee to minimize any potential impact.  As mentioned above, K-C worked with the County Department of Emergency Management (DEM) to upgrade their existing Emergency Alert System (EAS) so it now provides \u00bf911\u00bf service 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.  This should greatly reduce community risk should a major chemical release or other catastrophe occur.\r\n\r\nHypothetical Accidental Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical uncontrolled accidental releases.  EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it disperses to an ambient concentration equal to the \u00bfToxic Endpoint Concentration.\u00bf  The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds are specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no lasting physical harm but could interfere with the ability of people to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the facility are: 200 parts per million (ppm) of ammonia, 1 ppm of chlorine dioxide, and 3 ppm of sulfur dioxide. \r\n\r\nKimberly-Clark conducted safety reviews with plant operators, mechanics, engineers, and safety managers to evaluate a wide range of hypothetical accidents that could cause releases of ammonia, chlorine dioxide, or sulfur dioxide.  In accordance with EPA\u00bfs rule, two general types of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\r\n\r\n* The \u00bfAdministrative Worst-Case Release\u00bf that arbitrarily assumes the entire contents of the largest container of chemical is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.

      "SummaryText": "the safety review teams concluded have a realistic (but small) chance of actually occurring at the mill. These hypothetical releases generally consist of flange leaks, temporary process upsets, and breakage to pipes or tanks. \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario: Sulfur Dioxide\r\n\r\nFor the Worst-Case Release, the entire contents of a 100-ton tank containing pressurized liquid sulfur dioxide was assumed to be released as a gas in 10 minutes.  Kimberly-Clark is unaware of any conceivable accident that could such a large release.\r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide storage tanks are indoors.  Equations from EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\u00bf were used to estimate the release rate.  Based on EPA guidance in RMP* Comp Ver. 1.07, it was assumed that the building would partially contain the gaseous release, so of the 100 tons released inside the building only 55% would be lost to the outside air in the first 10 minutes.   RMP* Comp was used to estimate the distance that the sulfur dioxide plume would travel.  It is estimated that the plume would travel 8.1 miles before it dispersed to EPA\u00bfs toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm.  \r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario: Sulfur Dioxide\r\n\r\nKimberly-Clark\u00bfs safety review team selected the following hypothetical accident as the Alternate Release Scenario: a large earthquake breaks a 420-foot long pipe connecting the SO2 storage tanks to the processing plant.  The entire contents of the pipe (590 pounds of anhydrous liquid) spills onto the ground, forms a liquid pool that immediately cools to its boiling point temperature (-14 degrees F), and forms a puddle of SO2 \u00bfice\u00bf. It is estimated that 60 percent of the solid puddle would evaporate in 20 minutes to form a gas cloud that could blow downwind.   The resulting gaseous SO2 release is 17.5 pounds per minute for the first 20 minutes.  After that time the remaining SO2 would volatilize slowly.  Of the 590 pounds of spilled liquid, only 350 pounds would be released as a gas in the first 20"
