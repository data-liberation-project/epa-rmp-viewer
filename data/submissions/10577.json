Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Western Farm Service's Dos Palos Ave., Firebaugh facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 12325 N. Dos Palos Ave., Highway 33 & Hudson, Firebaugh, California, 93622 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia and ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000-gallon and one 20,000-gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 255,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight) is produced and stored at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in one 38,000-gallon above ground tank at the site. The storage tank is located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 285,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is 85,000 pounds.  \n\nPropane gas is received by tanker truck and stored in one 1,000-gallon and one 1,800-gallon above ground tanks at the site.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "ase Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nOne alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount releasing 154,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.79 miles.   The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release of 26,638 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a broken 3-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.56 miles.\n\nB.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 285,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution within the secondary containment structure.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.70 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release of 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\nC.  Propane Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  \nFailure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 9,090 pounds of propane.  It is assume that the entire tank contents are released as a vapor which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in a resulting explosion.    The distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 0.20 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a  pull-away failure of a 1-1/4-inch diameter pipe with a subsequent "

      "SummaryText": "vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.04 miles. \n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nPropane:  The facility has addressed fires and explosions that could result from a propane release in their Emergency Response Plan. \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and propane processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs. In summary, planned changes address the review and development of Standard Operating Procedures for regulated onsite processes."
