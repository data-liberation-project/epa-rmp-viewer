The plan only allows trained and qualified employees and off-site responders to respond to releases, spills, and or upsets.  Accidental release prevention, training and awareness are reinforced annually and as the operations at the plant dictates.  Employees receive training in Hazardous Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operations, maintenance, and emergency actions.  The Edy\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Laurel, Maryland facility has specific operational and emergency procedures in place for delivery and handling of ammonia. with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action/Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nEdy\u00bfs Grand Ice Creams\u00bf aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."

This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility\u00bfs Hazmat Teams, Howard County Fire Department, and the Howard County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n- Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nEdy\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, is located at 9090 Whiskey Bottom Road, Laurel, MD 20723.  The facility is responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of ice cream product in various varieties and specialties.  To accommodate the facility\u00bfs existing registered ammonia process system, a second separate ammonia process system (Big Scoop) located in the same general area is in final stage of construction, and is expected to go on-line and become fully operational by February 1, 2006.  As with the current process system, the second process will also use a discrete Anhydrous Ammonia closed loop refrigeration system as a heat removal media.  \n\nAs a result of a recognized highly toxic chemical used at the Edy\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream facility and in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program, 40 CFR, Section 68 requirements.  The facility has developed and implemented prevention program # 3 for the second process.  Additionally, the facility also has in place a Process Safety Management program for the process as required by OSHA Standard 1910.119.  As with the current process, the second process further uses this program as a management system per the outlined requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  \n\nEdy\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream"

EPA's RMP Comp model is referenced in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process. \n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file with Edy\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream (Risk Manager\u00bfs office).  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW V mapping system software, and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEdy\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream has integrated various engineering and administrative control mechanisms to eliminate and/or minimize any possible upsets/releases from this facility including; electronic ammonia detection and alarms located through out the facility, safety devices and interlocks that will shutdown equipment exceeding safe operating limits, safety relief valves are installed on all required equipment components including pressure vessels and oil separators to eliminate the possibility of an over-pressurization condition.   \n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe facility has implemented strict preventive maintenance procedures and an Emergency Action & Response Plan (ERP).
