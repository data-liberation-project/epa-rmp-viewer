The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ostrander Farmers' Co-op (Chester Tank Storage Location) are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of NH3 for sale to farmers.\n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 52500 pounds in our 12000 gallon storage tank. Maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi tank car holding 44000 pounds.\n\n-  Anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for direct soil application for crop production nutrients from this location.\n\n-   The number of tanks on hand at the facility will vary depending on time of year.\n\n3.  The accident release prevention program:\n\n-   The worst cases scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 52500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is 2.8 miles.\n\n-   The alternative release scenario is based on the 5 year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is .3 miles\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), CFR 1910.111, \"Strorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.  The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been"

The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility has:\n\n-  A written action plan , in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CRF 1910.38\n\n-  Provided stated and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA)\n\n7.  Planned changed in improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is on on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recomendations for implementation at this time."
