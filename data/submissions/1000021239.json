The Water Department is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Section Safety Supervisors are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the pump station. In addition, the Department has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothe potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe chlorine system for the Glorietta Park Pump Station of City of Glendale Water and Power is located at 2833 Verdugo Road in Glendale, California.  The chlorine system for the Glorietta Park Pump Station consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a maximum of two tanks at a time through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the treatment processes. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored for the chlorination process is 4,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that in the last five years (February 2006 - February 2011), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of \"any\" release at the Glorietta Park Pump Station. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of Glendale Water and Power employees. Since the Glorietta Park Pump Station is an unmanned facility, no evacuation would be required in case of a chlorine release.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of Glendale Water and Power responsible person, Ms. Miriam Caro Sykes, at least once a year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Glendale Water Department has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (November 2010) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (March 2009). Both studies resulted in minor procedural modifications to ensure a safe operation. These modifications are currently being"
