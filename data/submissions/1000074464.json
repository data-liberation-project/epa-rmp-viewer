The acetylene is a byproduct of a chemical production process.   The acetylene gas is compressed into specially designed individual acetylene cylinders or clusters which are then shipped to end-users.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; Flammable mixture of Acetylene and DMF or acetone -  resale to end market users\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Gurabo facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous subst"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nAcetylene safety systems are designed for manual and automated shutdown.  An operator also attends the process.\n\nAn incident alarm system can be activated manually that will shutdown the process and activate the deluge system.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Gurabo facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Gurabo location will be a \"non-responding facility\" as defined in section 8.1 of the "

Copies of the facility emergency plans are shared with these agencies and drills are conducted at least annually.\n\n\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the facility emergency action plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n\n\n"
