We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders. This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response   personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) organization, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nThe plan has been updated to simplify and combine interconnected processes, resulting in a change from eight to five processes.  As part of the overall review of the re-submission, the regulated substances and inventories were reviewed, and modifications have been made accordingly.  \r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nOur facility produces a number of products that include Propylene Oxide (PO), Styrene Monomer (SM), Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (ETBE), Polyether Polyols (Polyols), and an assortment of products from the Butanediols (BDO) unit, including Allyl Alcohol (AA). There are two PO/SM units, one RTBE unit in which either MTBE or ETBE can be produced, one Polyols unit, and one BDO unit. These operating units process the following chemicals that have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause signi"

PO is the major product of the CVOS facility and is also a feedstock for the Polyols and BDO production units.\r\n\r\nAllyl Alcohol (AA): Approximately 5.3 million lbs. are on-site based on storage and production. AA is a product produced in the BDO unit.\r\n\r\nEthylene Oxide (EO): Approximately 3.6 million lbs. are stored and used on-site. EO is a primary feedstock of the Polyols unit.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3): Approximately 66,000 lbs. of NH3 are stored on-site to be utilized in the control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) in the Utilities area.\r\n\r\nFlammables - \r\n\r\nPropylene: Approximately 257,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site. Propylene is the primary feedstock for both PO units.\r\n\r\nEthylene: Approximately 32,000 lbs. are contained in a pipeline and is used as a primary feedstock to produce Ethylbenzene in the two PO/SM units.\r\n\r\nIsobutylene: Approximately 8.9 million lbs. are stored in a sphere, railcars and within the process of the RTBE unit. Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of RTBE and is purified for selling as finished product.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixtures:  Approximately 14 million lbs. of flammable mixtures are stored and processed through-out the PO/SM, BDO, and RTBE units and (un)loading areas.  Regulated substances in these flammable mixtures are:  Acetaldehyde, Isobutylene, Methylamine, Propane, Propylene, and Propylene Oxide.  \r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0  General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nLyondell Chemicals Channelview Operations (CVOS) has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accident"

All contractor employees must attend the Houston Area Safety Council training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant. In addition to basic training, site specific training is required prior to arriving at the plant. The company has a rigorous process for pre-screening all contract companies to ensure they meet all company requirements.  All resident and many non-resident contractors are part of the site's CHESS (Contractors Helping Everyone Stay Safe) Team.\r\n\r\n4.0  Five Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of substances regulated under the RMP rule at this facility over the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.0  Emergency Response\r\nThe site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the site coordinates with the community response plan through the North Channel LEPC, as well as the Harris County Office of Emergency Management.
