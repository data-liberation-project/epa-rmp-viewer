This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nWhite Energy has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the following documents: Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan, and Facility Response Plan (with Emergency Response Action Plan).  Most of the documents listed have a minimum of annual training requirements to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the plant.  Employees (in specific job roles) are required to read and be familiar with the contents of the above-listed plans.\n\n\n\nWhite Energy's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nWhite Energy is located in Russell, Russell County, Kansas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from waste starch water and corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is based on the release of the entire contents of "

The denaturant tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  This secondary containment structure was not used as a passive mitigation measure when determining the worst case scenario for denaturant.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine intial RMP applicablity, White Energy continues to use this worst case MSDS for this RMP resubmission.  Of the entire tank contents, totalling 218,400 pounds, only 74,256 pounds are considered reportable constituents under the RMP program.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, model results are maintained with this RMP in facility records.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, records are maintained with this RMP in facility records.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 50,400 pounds of denaturant due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.  The endpoint used was an overpressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations.  Therefore, a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping that leads to the lined tank farm berm for secondary containment.  For this scenario, active and passive mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place at the facility would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, model results are maintained with this RMP in facility records.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, records are maintained with"
