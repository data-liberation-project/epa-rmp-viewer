To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulators.\n\nHydrocoolers\n\nThe purpose of the hydrocoolers is to remove heat from water which is used to precool fresh fruit. The hydrocoolers receive liquid from flooded accumulators. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the hydrocoolers and is returned to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the hydrocoolers contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nMain Suction Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulators is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulators receive vapor from the flooded accumulators and separate any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulators drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessels. The main suction accumulators are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulators contain low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nLiquid Transfer Vessels\n\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessels is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration systems back to the high pressure receivers or controlled pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulators. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure"

Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulators. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel.

The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\nHigh Pressure Receivers\n\nThe purpose of the high pressure receivers is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nControlled Pressure Receiver\n\nThe purpose of the controlled pressure receiver (CPR) is to provide a safe location to add and store liquid ammonia at a constant pressure in the refrigeration system. The CPR receives liquid from the thermosyphon vessel that is supplied by the condenser. The CPR is maintained at an intermediate pressure that is less than the condensing pressure, but greater than the suction pressure. From the CPR, liquid is supplied to each zone of refrigeration. The CPR is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The CPR is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system.
