This is accomplished to a great extent by compliance with our detailed Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs.  These programs are designed to meet or exceed the standards set out by OSHA (29 CFR 1910.119), the EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan Rule, and other applicable state and local requirements.\n\nUnited States Cold Storage Warsaw is a public refrigerated warehouse that stores raw or processed food items (such as those found in your local supermarkets or restaurants) prior to distribution.  Temperatures of the different product storage areas can range from -30?F to +40?F.  Our refrigeration process uses a chemical known as anhydrous ammonia contained within a closed-loop system.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia has been used safely in commercial refrigeration applications since the early 1900\u0092s.  It has an excellent warning property, which is a distinct and irritating odor which can be detected at concentrations as low as 5 PPM (parts per million) in air.  Most people are familiar with the smell as it is a common ingredient in many household cleaning products.\n\nThe total refrigerant charge at USCS Warsaw is approximately 59,541 lbs.  Throughout the process, most of the ammonia resides within pressure-rated vessels inside of a specially constructed machinery room.  During the cooling/freezing process, liquid ammonia is pumped from a vessel through piping to evaporator units in each area that needs cooling such as the storage rooms or docks.  As that ammonia passes through the evaporator, it pulls heat from the surrounding area and changes from a liquid into a vapor within the pipes.  That vapor is sent to a condenser unit on the roof, where the outside of the coils is cooled by air or water, getting rid of the excess/unwanted heat, and changing back from a vapor to a liquid before flowing back to the vessel to close t"

An electronic control system monitors conditions 24-7 and will automatically notify maintenance staff of any abnormal operating conditions.\n\nIn addition, there are dozens of safety measures in place.

The facility has not had a release resulting in employee injuries or off-site impacts in the last 5 years.\n\nUSCS Warsaw maintains emergency response and emergency action plans which are reviewed and updated annually.  These programs are based on the OSHA requirements found in 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, in addition to all applicable EPA and other local/state requirements.\n\nEach USCS location has first responders trained in emergency response (24-hr hazmat technician level specializing in ammonia releases).
