It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Brighton Fire District (via 911 calls) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire district, a call will be made to the Adams County LEPC and the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment. If there is a Reportable Quantity (RQ) release a call will also be made to the National Emergency Response Center. Finally, other emergency response agencies may also be contacted.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, every situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it was planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous  Ammonia, aqua ammonia, etc.), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accidents of acts of God which might occur on our property.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Agfinity Incorporated at Henderson, Colorado is Jerry Throckmorton, Supervisor of Agronomy. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n\n\n    Mark Milenski, Director of Agronomy Operations\n\n        WORK:        (970) 737-21"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. Anhydrous ammonia is also reacted with water to form aqua ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide) which is utilized by area water treatment and power generation plants.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia plant consists of two (2) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis. Full-time equivalent employee numbers are computed on this basis. The FTEs for this company location is eight (8).\n\n\n\nThe aqua ammonia plant consists of two (2) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, pump, convertor, and other miscellaneous equipment. Aqua ammonia is manufactured on an ass needed basis throughout the entire year. There is one (1) full-time employee assigned routine responsibility for this plant.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia plants is the failure of the single largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in the release of the total volume. In the case of the anhydrous ammonia plant, the total volume is released in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Co"

According to EPAA?s RMP*Comp Program, the distance to endpoint is 1 mile.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia plant involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake line manifold without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles. Similarly, a transfer line failure at the aqua ammonia plant has a distance to endpoint, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program of 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe systems are protected from major release (one or more of the following) by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoff valves, and remote emergency shutoff valves. The load out risers used in filling nurse tanks at the anhydrous ammonia plant are protected by breakaway couplers designed to stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use and the plant(s) are left unattended.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity of metropolitan areas, schools, a major transportation artery, etc. provisions have been designed to notify affected persons. Copies of the Risk Management Plan have been distributed to the Brighton Fire District and the Adams County LEPC.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1 and State law.\n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release.

In the unlikely event that the Fire District is unable to adequately respond to the emergency, the fire department(s) with which Brighton Fire District has mutual aid agreements will be summoned.

Employees working at the plants make routine visual observations prior to and during transfer operations from storage vessels to transportation equipment whether portable nurse tanks or tank trucks. In so doing they are able to detect visible problems before they arise. This visual inspection identifies potions of the systems which may be under stress and about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and/or aqua ammonia.
