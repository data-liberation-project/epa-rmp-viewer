The Facility Policy\n\n        The owners,management,and employees of Bolduc and Sons, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental\nreleases of anhydrous ammonia. If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire \ndepartment or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information.\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage, and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n        Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n        The maximum quantity stored would be 88,000 pounds in our 12,000 and 9,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n          A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .67 miles.\n\n          B.   The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM)is .41 miles.\n\n4.      The accidental release prevention program\n\n                  The facility has implemented an accidental release and prevention program for storage and handling of anhydrous\nammonia.\n\n5.       The five-year accident history.\n\n                    A.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n                           -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility:nor\n       "

The Emergency Response Program \n\n                   The facility has:\n                       A. A written emergency action plan that has been implemented through our company.\n                       B. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n                       information as required.\n7. Planned changes to improve saftey.\n\n                    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the \nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for\nimplemenation at this time."
