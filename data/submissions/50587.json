Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Respose Policies\n\nRalphs has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety by operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention program and emergency planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment. These programs include OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (Precess Safety Management or PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\n\nII.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nRalph's Riverside Facility operates both a distribution center and a fluid product manufacturing plant. Accordingly, there are two separate and distinct refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. One system provides refrigerated warehousing of perishables foods and ice production which contains an ammonia charge of approximately 49,534 pounds. The other system provides refrigeration for manufactured fluid milk and other beverages and contains an ammonia charge of approximately 14,830 pounds.\n\n\nIII.  General Accident Relese Prevention Program and Chemial Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur RMP/PSM enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the RMP/PSM prevents accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoids physical property damage.\n\nOur RMP/PSM prevent accidents because it focuses on the rules, procedures and practices which govern the individual processes, activities, and pieces of equipment.

      "SummaryText": "These rules are enhanced as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at this facility.\n\nOur RMP/PSM contains the following elements:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractor Qualifications\n- Emergency Response and Evacuation Procedures\n\n\nIV. Five-Year Accicent History\n\nIn the last five years there have been no documented accidental releases of ammonia from either ammonia refrigeration process at the facility. \n\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nOur faciity has an in-house first responder team that is trained to handle chemical releases and works in cooperation with the City of Riverside Fire Department. Training on emergency response procedures is provided to maintenance engineers upon hiring and refresher courses are provided regularly.  The facility maintains a mobile emergency command center that can be used to assist with catastrophic scenarios.  A trailer with personal protective equipment (PPE) including Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) is also located on site and is regularly maintained by the engineering department.\n\nIn the event emergency health services are required, trained responders are equiped with basic first aid knowledge and will assist the Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services personnel.\n\n\nVI. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe facility is designed and constructed in accordance with the appropriate building and safety codes as well as relevent fire codes. Any improvements of requested changes to the facility have been addressed prior to startup and worker safety procedures are in place.\n\nThe Distribution Engineering Manager and Creamery Plant Engineer are the program coordinators with the overall responsibliity to ensure that program goals and objectives are met and app"

The program coordinators review and update the RMP/PSM as necessary. Copies of the written program may be reviewed by request to one of the coordinators.\n\nIf you feel that any improvements can be made to our RMP/PSM, please contact either the Distribution Engineering Manager or the Creamery Plant Engineer. We encourage all suggestions because we are committed to the success of our RMP/PSM. We strive for a comprehensive, intergrated prevention system which stresses clear understanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of the facility and public."
