      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested person(s), including employees, that Ralphs Grocery Company's Riverside Facility, located at 1500 Eastridge Avenue, Riverside, California, has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 and California Title19.\n\n\nI.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Respose Policies\n\nRalphs has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety by operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention program and emergency planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment. These programs include OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (Precess Safety Management or PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\n\nII.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nRalph's Riverside Facility operates both a distribution center and a fluid product manufacturing plant. Accordingly, there are two separate and distinct refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. One system provides refrigerated warehousing of perishables foods and ice production which contains an ammonia charge of approximately 49,534 pounds. The other system provides refrigeration for manufactured fluid milk and other beverages and contains an ammonia charge of approximately 14,830 pounds.\n\n\nIII.  General Accident Relese Prevention Program and Chemial Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur RMP/PSM enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the RMP/PSM prevents accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoids physical property damage.\n\nOur RMP/PSM prevent accidents because it focuses on the rules, procedures and practices which govern the individual processes, activities, and pieces of equipment."
