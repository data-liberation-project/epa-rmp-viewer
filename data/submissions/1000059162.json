The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 50 Mine Street, is the storage and distibution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 1-30,000 storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 598,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
