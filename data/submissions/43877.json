This includes a dedicated environmental, health and safety department that works together with plant operations to ensure that a program is in place such that safety and preparedness is maintained for all plant employees and the surrounding community.  In addition, Lubrizol complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertaining to environmental, safety and health.\n\nAs part of the safety program, all new employees go through a safety orientation program.  This includes but is not limited to the correct use of personal protection equipment, safe practices on the job and awareness and use of emergency equipment.\n\nA training program is in place to train all employees to reach and maintain proficiency in safe work practices and maintain the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs.  All contractors are also required to be a part of the same safety and training programs.\n\nMany layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases.  Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards.  Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up.  A maintenance and inspection program is conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process safety program includes a measurement of performance, audits and implementation of corrective actions.  This continuous management of the system assures that safety is always the top priority.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, we have a trained and certified emergency response organization staffed 24 hours a day to immediately react and mitigate the emergency.

Some of the key elements are as follows:\n\nFor each covered process, there are on hand all associated process safety information, many layers of protection in place including safe design of equipment, emergency and control devices and instrumentation, safe operational procedures, monitoring equipment, back-up systems, maintenance and inspection programs and an improved training system for all employees.  All of these mechanisms are continuously being reviewed and revised to assure that our facility operates in the safest and most efficient manner.\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nThere were no incidents at the facility in the past five years that meets the definition of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements.  \n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nLubrizol maintains an emergency response policy at its stationary site located at 155 Freedom Rd., Painesville, Ohio  44077.  There is an emergency response organization (ERO) in place twenty-four hours a day.  This consists of an incident commander and trained emergency responders.  There are also certified hazardous material technicians, EMT's and paramedics on staff.  The emergency response policy is documented within Lubrizol Painesville's \"Emergency Response Plan\" manual.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authorities and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  There is a public notification and alert system in place that will notify the surrounding community as needed.  There is continuous training of personnel on and offsite and in conjunction with the local emergency responders.  The emergency response plan is currently and continuously being updated as changes are needed.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nAn environmental, health and safety corrective action system was put in place to address all odors, spills and injuries that may occur at our facility.  This system identifies the root cause of the problem "

A system is in place to review the progress and check the effectiveness of the corrective actions.  From this there has been new training developed plant-wide that addresses a multitude of areas that will improve the overall environmental, health and safety of our facility and surrounding community. \n\nIn addition, all RMP covered processes undergo a process hazard analysis on a routine basis to identify any potential hazards.  If there are any concerns, projects are initiated to address the concerns as part of our continuous capital improvement process.  Some recent projects completed related to RMP regulated processes include upgrades to fire suppressant systems, level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment. \n\nAlso, as the spirit of the RMP rule suggests our site has substituted a less hazardous non-RMP regulated substance for one of our previous RMP regulated substances. Chlorine has been completely eliminated from our site; thus the reason for this resubmittal.\n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosphy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community."
