The management and employees of the Medford facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Chlorine or Silane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, purification, and distribution of Electronic Gases. There are four covered PSM processes and three covered RMP process. The three RMP covered processes are the following:\n\n\n\n1.  Chlorine  - storage, purification and filling. \n\n2.  Silane/Disilane - storage, purification and filling. \n\n3.  Trichlorosilane  - storage and filling\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenarios, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release (Silane and Tricholosilane)) and the worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release (Chlorine), were used. The alternative release (or more probable) scenarios used, involved the release of flammable gas (Silane and Trichlorosilane) and release of toxic gas (Chlorine), and were also based on EPA criteria.  Both can be reviewed by contacting the Linde facility.\n\n\n\nThe impacted area were determined using the 2000 US Census data obtained from \"Land View V\".  No environmental receptors are affected.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Chlorine, Trichlorosilane, and/or Silane.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consul"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for each process, which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases. The PHAs focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA re-validation for the Chlorine Process was completed on July 21, 2010, and the PHA for the Silane Process was completed on August 2, 2010.  The PHA for the Trichlorosilane process was completed on March 3, 2011.  Each will be updated at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were reviewed in October 2010 for the Chlorine and Silane processes.  The operating procedures for Trichlorosilane were reviewed on March 3, 2011.

In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed in October 2010 for the Chlorine and Silane processes, and March 4, 2011 for the Trichlorosilane process.\n\n\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractor safety procedures were last review in February 21, 2011.  \n\n\n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.

Equipment used to store, process, or handle Chlorine, Silane/Disilane and Trichlorosilane has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.
