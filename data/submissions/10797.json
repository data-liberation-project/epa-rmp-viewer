Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Farmer's Coop. of North Washington, IA  (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 18,870 pounds. The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.2 miles.\n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a hose rupture caused by a pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of a 4-inch transfer hose. The active mitigation devices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release tothe contents of the hose. The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds. The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or enviro"
