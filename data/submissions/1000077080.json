OxyChem is committed to operating and maintaining all of its processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources invested to prevent accidents. As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), OxyChem adheres to the principles of Responsible Care. In addition to ensuring that its employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, OxyChem demands that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of manufacturing processes. Process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards, including those of the Chlorine Institute, for equipment used in manufacturing and handling chlorine. Maintenance and inspection programs designed to ensure site integrity have been implemented.\n\n\n\nOxyChem's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated subs"

Examples of such controls include: 1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to over pressurization; 2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition; 3) using materials of construction that are compatible with process chemistry; 4) monitoring vessel pressure and temperature continuously; and 5) adherence to strict work permitting systems.\n\n\n\nIf a release does occur, personnel are trained to respond to, control, and contain the release. Mitigation measures include installation of isolation valves, automatic shut off valves that limit the amount of chemical released, fire suppression systems in areas where flammable chemicals are present, fire fighting equipment in all process areas, fully implemented emergency response plans, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in control rooms, and an alarm system for early notification of a release. If a release occurs, we use a dispersion model, Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER) system, and meteorological data from an on-site weather tower to predict the plume direction, downwind ground level chemical concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach offsite areas. For a significant release, information will be communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies. In addition, the plant utilizes a Community Alert Network (CAN) system to alert residents within a 2-mile radius around the plant in case of a release that may impact offsite areas. The CAN system is periodically function tested.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant is primarily involved in manufacturing chlorine and chlorinated organic chemicals. Plant products are distributed to customers via rail cars, tank trucks, and in containers. As a part of these manufacturing processes, several substances that are covered by the Chemical Accident Prevention Prov"

The following regulated substances are present at the plant site, though not all of them are held in threshold quantities as defined in the RMP rule: chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloroform, methyl chloride, phosgene, phosphorous oxychloride, sulfur dioxide, acetylene, hydrogen, and isobutane. All of the covered processes are subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nOxyChem's products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout the American and global economies, playing a role in nearly every modern industry and in thousands of products that consumers use every day.\n\n\n\nBesides process equipment, the plant has a number of tanks for storage of raw materials and products, rail car and truck loading / unloading facilities, a laboratory, and a research and development facility. Because large quantities of chemicals are handled, OxyChem used a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to protect our employees, the public, and the environment. Information on these programs is provided in other sections of this executive summary. OxyChem is committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\n3.0 Key Offsite Consequence Review\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires OxyChem to provide information about two types of offsite consequence analysis scenarios: a worst-case scenario and alternative release scenarios. There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling the worst-case release scenario; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative. The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals handled at the plant and about their relative hazards. The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.

Estimates of the impacted population were determined through the use of MARPLOT software, version 5.1.1. Information on environmental receptors was obtained from USGS topographic maps, aerial photos and plant maps.   \n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the RMP rule. Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below in Sections 4.1 through 4.12.\n\n\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility. These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as 1) operating limits for the equipment, 2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and 3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes. Plant personnel rely on these documents to perform their job functions properly, consistently and in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nChemical information is usually documented in safety data sheets (SDSs). SDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with a chemical. This information typically includes: 1) toxicity information; 2) physical data; 3) reactivity and corrosivity data; 4) thermal and chemical stability data; 5) hazards of mixing substances together; and 6) emergency response measures. SDSs are available to all employees, as well as to the emergency responders who may have to be involved in incident response at the plant.\n\n\n\nImportant process parameters a"

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards. Our hazard assessments focus on preventing incidents, accidents, and injuries to plant personnel and community, and on preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\n\n\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses. A team comprising personnel with engineering, process and operations experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process including looking at previous incidents with catastrophic potential, and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences, including possible health and safety effects. The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of engineering and administrative prevention and mitigation measures designed to prevent that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary. These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are resolved.\n\n\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years. The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved.\n\n\n"

These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as 1) initial startup of a new or improved process, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown due to loss of utilities or feed, 5) normal shutdown, and 6) emergency operations. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees. In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits for operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, flows and compositions, consequences of deviating from the safe limits, applicable safety and health information, procedures for preparing equipment for maintenance, and list safety systems such as pressure relief devices, rupture discs, scrubbers, and fire protection systems. Operating procedures are annually reviewed and revised if necessary.\n\n\n\n4.4 Training\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks. Both classroom and on-the-job training is provided. Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes: 1) a general overview of the process; 2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated safety and health hazards; 3) safe work practices; and 4) a review of the operating procedures for that process. Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.

All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\n\n4.5 Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of its equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. Preventive and predictive maintenance practices keep equipment in good working condition and warn operators and maintenance personnel of problems, allowing proactive repairs to be completed. Preventive measures taken include choosing proper materials of construction (e.g., to prevent corrosion, much of the piping in certain sections of our plant is monel, Teflon-lined or fiberglass rather than carbon steel), use of sealess or double-seal pumps in organic chemical service, and use of water treatment chemicals that will minimize corrosion of process equipment such as heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nPredictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, ultrasonic and oil analysis. Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps, compressors, fans and motors. Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment. Ultrasonic technology uses sound waves to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping. Oil analysis is a chemical evaluation of oil samples that helps determine the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. The inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails. When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root cause(s) of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.\n\n\n\nOxyChem's quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for"

The mechanical integrity system includes: 1) inspection and testing procedures and implementation of these procedures on a regular schedule; 2) procedures for safe work practices; 3) maintenance procedures for various equipment; 4) maintenance personnel training; and 5) required documentation.\n\n\n\n4.6 Management of Change\n\n\n\nWe review changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measures are adequate. Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with another valve that meets the design specifications), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that 1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, 2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, 3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and 4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated. The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\n\n4.7 Pre-startup Review\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Wichita Plant performs a pre-startup safety review for all new facilities or whenever a change at an existing facility occurs that requires updating the process safety information. This review ensures that safety features, procedures, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted and that personnel are prepared to implement the change. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly. Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that 1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, 2) adequate operating, safety, environmental, emergency and maintenance procedures are in place, 3) training for all affected employees is complete, and "

These are scheduled so that every area of the facility is inspected four times per year.\n\n\n\n5.0 Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions. This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the OxyChem Wichita Plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment. These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release. They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment. The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility.\n\n\n\n5.1 Release Detection\n\n\n\na)Releases are detected quickly because operators routinely perform inspections in their area.\n\nb) There is video surveillance of key loading/unloading operations.\n\nc) Procedures require that a OxyChem Wichita Plant employee monitor loading and unloading operations.\n\nd) Hand-held monitoring equipment such as draeger tubes are used as needed for release detection. Additionally, electronic instrumentation can be used for specific chemicals.\n\ne) There is a network of fixed chlorine monitors throughout the plant that are continuously monitored for potential releases of chlorine.\n\n\n\n5.2 Release Containment and Control\n\n\n\na) Breather valves on storage tanks discharge to a thermal oxidizer to capture and incinerate vents.\n\nb) Some pressure relief valves discharge to scrubbers where the stream is neutralized before venting to the atmosphere.\n\nc) Valves are used to permit isolation of a process where a release has occurred.\n\nd) A"
