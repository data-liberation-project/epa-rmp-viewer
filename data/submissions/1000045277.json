      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN Executive summary\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Dow Chemical Riverside Site is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained personnel are at hand to initiate Immediate Response to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Committee and the Dunklin Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise and response.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Dow Chemical Riverside Site's primary activity encompasses Extruded Polystyrene Foam Production.  One RMP-regulated flammable substance is handled and stored above threshold quantities at the facility, 1,1-Difluroethane (also known as HFC-152a), which is used as a blowing agent for extruded polystyrene foam production.  HFC-152a is received by rail car and prior to being pumped to a storage tank where it is fed into the foam production process.  Two processes involving HFC-152a have been eliminated since the last RMP update; isotainer storage and isotainer metering.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Site's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nDow Chemical facilities require management of all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than like for like, by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation of changes.   Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Riverside Site. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Riverside Site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the inci"

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Dow Chemical Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOur company hires contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  The Riverside Site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are coordinated with the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Committee and the Dunklin Fire Department.\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Site has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterl"
