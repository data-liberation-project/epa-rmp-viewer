      "SummaryText": "\nEmpire Energy, LLC owns and operates a geothermal power plant at Empire Nevada.  The facility is a geothermal power plant typical of the type generally referred to as a binary plant.  There are four power generation modules consisting of heat exchangers, feed pump, turbine generator skid, and controls.  In the process, hot liquid pumped from the geothermal resource under pressure is directed to each of the power generation modules.  Heat is transferred from the geothermal liquid to a secondary working fluid, in this case isopentane.  The isopentane is vaporized using heat from the geothermal liquid, and the resulting vapor is directed to the turbine.  Spent isopentane vapor is directed into another heat exchanger where it is condensed into a liquid.  Cooling water from a standard cooling tower is used to carry away the heat of condensation.  Liquid pentane from the condenser is directed to the feed pump, which increases the pressure of the liquid.  The isopentane liquid then is directed first to a preliminary heat exchanger that raises the temperature, and then back into the vaporizer thus completing a closed loop cycle.  Spent geothermal liquid is reinjected back into the geothermal resource via injection wells.  There are four Operation and Maintenance Technicians that share the manning of the plant on a 24/7 basis.  The Plant Manager serves as the relief operator.\nThere are no other listed toxic chemicals on-site.\nThe worst case scenario for flammable explosive or reactive chemicals determined that there are no public receptors or residential population at risk within the distance to the end point of 1 psi.  The analysis assumes 64,396 pounds of isopentane.  It was found that .3 miles is the end point.\nThere have been no reportable accidents within the last five years.\nOur Process Safety Management Plan (PSN) was updated in 2003.  This covers items related to those specified in Program 3 - Prevention."
