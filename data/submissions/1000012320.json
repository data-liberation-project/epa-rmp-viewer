      "SummaryText": "Guardian Energy, LLC (Guardian) is a dry-mill ethanol production facility located in Janesville, Waseca County, Minnesota.  Guardian began operations in November 2009 and is capable of producing up to 110 million gallons of un-denatured ethanol per year.\n\nGuardian uses anhydrous ammonia to control pH in the slurry tank and provide nutrients to the yeast which produce ethanol.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility via truck and is stored as a liquid under pressure in an 18,000-gallon tank.  The tank is never filled above 85 percent; therefore, the maximum amount on-site never exceeds 15,300 gallons, or about 79,100 pounds.  Guardian also uses natural gasoline condensate as a denaturant to render the final ethanol product unfit for consumption.  Denaturant is delivered to the facility via truck or rail and is stored as a liquid at atmospheric pressure in a 188,000 gallon tank.  The denaturant typically contains up to 70 percent pentane.  The nature of the denaturant causes the substance and its constituents to vary in mixture content and percentage. Guardian does not commonly have more than 100,000 gallons of denaturant on-site at any given time; therefore, the maxiumum amount of pentane on-site will likely never exceed 70,000 gallons, or 350,000 pounds. \n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates facilities which store anhydrous ammonia and pentane in excess of 10,000 pounds as part of its Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions at 40 CFR 68.  Guardian is capable of storing up to 79,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and 350,000 pounds of pentane; therefore, the anhydrous ammonia and denaturant processes are subject to 40 CFR 68.  The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulates facilities which store anhydrous ammonia and flammables in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds under the Process Safety Management (PSM) rule at 29 CFR 1910.119; therefore, Guardian\u00c2\u00bfs anhydrous ammonia and flammables/denaturant processes ar"

      "SummaryText": "e regulated under the PSM rule.    \n\nGuardian also stores a number of other hazardous chemicals at the facility.  Other than anhydrous ammonia and pentane, Guardian stores no other known substances in quantities that exceed threshold storage amounts, or that are listed under 40 CFR 68.  The MSDS for the denaturant notes that the substance can include trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide; however, it is not expected that these trace amounts will exceed EPA's threshold storage quantity of 10,000 pounds.    \n\nGuardian is committed to the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment from a release of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant.  It is Guardian\u00c2\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Senior management supports the safe operation of the facility and all of its elements, and has designated responsibility the development, implementation, and integration of RMP elements to the facility Environmental, Health, and Safety Manager.  All Guardian employees and contractors are trained on the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant, the safe use of the processes, and emergency response procedures related to a release.  Guardian maintains a written emergency response program (Integrated Contingency Plan) which was developed and has been shared with emergency response planning agencies.  In the event of a release it is Guardian policy to notify the City of Janesville Police and Fire Departments, evacuate all employees from the facility, and provide all requested information to local emergency response personnel in the event that a community evacuation is required.  Guardian has worked with emergency response personnel in the community to assess the hazards at the facility and has developed a working relationship with response agencies to ensure an efficient, effective response in the event of a potential incident.  Guardian plans to conduct drills and exercises to test facility and agency response to incidents at the fa"

Guardian has implemented a PSM Program which includes the following elements: an employee participation plan; compiled process safety information; use of process hazard analyses; standard operating procedures and safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line breaking, and confined space entry; a training program; a contractor program; the use of pre-startup safety reviews; a  computerized mechanical integrity program; a hot work permit program; a management of change system; incident investigation procedures; an emergency response plan (Integrated Contingency Plan); and the use of periodic compliance audits.  The PSM program serves as the RMP Prevention Program at Guardian.  All elements of the PSM program contribute to the safe management and use of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant. \n\nGuardian has implemented a training program for new hires and contractors and will ensure that all new hires and contractors are properly trained on the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant and the emergency response plans of the facility.  Guardian will seek out the latest safe work practices and will provide appropriate personal protective equipment to individuals working with anhydrous ammonia and denaturant, and will not hesitate to implement measures to enhance protection systems already in place.\n\nGuardian has not experienced any releases of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant in the last 5 years."
