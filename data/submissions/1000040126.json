The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" EPA's RMP CompTM was the release model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account.\n\nGenerally, the Kingsbury Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements.   The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride, Anhydrous Ammonia and Methyl Chloride Processes include the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response.

For example, a rail car of Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride that was connected to the process has been replaced by one tube on a tube trailer connected to the process reducing a worst case scenario release by two orders of magnitude. Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride process controls, monitoring and detection equipment has further controlled exposure to hazards.  \n\n\n\nInfrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards.    \n\nIn the last five years, the Kingsbury plant has had two small quantity accidental releases; a chlorine release on February 2012 that resulted in one injury with no days away from work and no off-site injuries or harm to the environment, and a sulfur dioxide release on February 2013 that resulted in one injury with no days away from work and no off-site injuries or harm to the environment.  \n\n\n\nThe Kingsbury Plant has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (\"One Plan\") based on the EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office guidelines.

In-plant emergency response team training includes classroom instruction, hands-on demonstrations, and exercises with local first responders including La Porte County HAZMAT Team, La Porte County Sheriff's Department, Porter County HAZMAT Team and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, District 1 Incident Management Team.  Each year two plant emergency response team members attend the Mississippi Fire Academy's HAZMAT Response Training.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, plant personnel are actively involved in emergency planning with community emergency management and response stakeholders including participation on the La Porte County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Board. Alexander Chemical is listed as a resource for both personnel and equipment for incidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, methyl chloride, anhydrous hydrogen chloride and ammonium hydroxide as part of the community emergency response plan. Joint exercises and training are conducted with local first responders including the La Porte County LEPC and La Porte County HAZMAT personnel, and table top exercises with the Cities of La Porte and South Bend, Indiana.

Designated plant personnel are \"on-call\" as part of the Chlorine Institute's CHLOREP Sector 9 Response Team.  \n\n\n\nA plant management team representative attends the Chlorine Institute's Annual and Fall Meetings to learn new safety-related developments and best practices involving the safe production, use and distribution of chlorine, sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite, and the distribution and use of hydrogen chloride. In addition, the plant will send a representative to the Chlorine Institute's Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride (AHCl) Emergency Task Group meeting to develop response guidelines for AHCl releases.\n\n\n\nSeveral changes to improve safety and security are planned, budgeted or being implemented including process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring/detection systems, security physical protection systems, hazard reviews/evaluations, contractor management and additional personnel resources. For example, Carus Corporation has created a position for a PSM Specialist to support plants in their PSM activities such as providing audit assistance, process hazard analysis lead/facilitator role, regulatory updates, PSM incident analysis and sharing best practices. Also, this individual provides leadership, culture, and policy guidance to Carus Corporation and Alexander Chemical Corporation management regarding their PSM System.\n\n"
