(MOP) operates the Martin Resources Plainview Fertilizer Plant (herein after referred to as the Facility or MRI).  The facility handles substances considered hazardous by the U.S. EPA and has implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition to training and procedures, the facility has implemented a Mechanical Integrity Program, emergency shutdown systems and warning alarms.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Plainview Fire Department, and other interested authorities, to mitigate any release, inform all affected parties and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nMRI handles anhydrous ammonia for the production of ammonium sulfate fertilizer and control of SO2 emissions from the sulfuric acid plant.  Ammonia is transported to the facility via tanker truck and unloaded into pressurized storage vessels.  From the vessels, the ammonia is transferred via piping to the ammonium sulfate plant or acid plant.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is managed as required under RMP Program 3 (or Subpart D) and OSHA's PSM program.  Program 3 requires that MRI have the process safety information for the hazardous chemical, conduct a process hazard analysis (PHA), create operating procedures, conduct training, implement a mechanical integrity program, implement a management of change program, conduct pre-startup reviews, conduct compliance audits, conduct incident investigations, ensure employee participation, issue hot work permits, and include contractors in the release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Saf"

The SDS contains all of the information required by 40 CFR ?68.65(b)(1)-(7).\n\n\n\nInformation pertaining to the technology of the process at MRI is contained in block flow diagrams (PFD) and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID).  The chemistry of the substances stored, maximum inventory, safe upper and lower temperature, pressure, and flow limits, and the evaluation of the consequences of deviations are all maintained on site and are managed by the PSM Coordinator.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nA PHA was conducted and has been re-evaluated every 5 years.  The PHA was and is conducted by qualified staff which consists of corporate Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) staff and on site staff.  The methods utilized to complete the PHA have been checklist, what-if analysis and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  Other methodologies as allowed by 40 CFR ?68.67b(1)-(7) may be used in future updates of the PHA if applicable.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are written by competent staff, such as facility managers or lead operators, which have experience with the tasks outlined in the procedure.  The procedures include all of the elements described in 40 CFR ?68.69(a)(1)-(3), are kept onsite and made available to any employee for review.  The operating procedures are reviewed as needed or when a management of change occurs and are certified annually.  Safe work practices have also been developed as required in 40 CFR ?68.69(d).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nEach new employee at Martin is trained according to his/her job role.  Those employees at MRI undergo initial awareness training as well as specific training on procedures they may use in operating a process.  The employees are refreshed at least once every three years and their training is documented and kept on site for review.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMartin utilizes trained p"

Any deficiencies found by the mechanical integrity group that are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to track and manage changes to operating procedures, process equipment, chemicals, technology, process safety information, and, changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that the considerations found in 40 CFR ?68.75(b)(1)-(5) are addressed prior to any change.\n\n\n\nThose employees affected by the change are notified and trained on the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews will be conducted prior to startup of  any new stationary sources or any modified stationary sources, when those modifications are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review confirms that prior to the introduction of regulated substances to a process: construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for new sources, a PHA has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and modified sources meet the requirements contained in the management of change; training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted once every three years to verify that procedures and practices developed under the RMP rules "
