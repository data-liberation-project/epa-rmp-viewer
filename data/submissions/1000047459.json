This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Institute Site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many specialty chemical products for Union Carbide. Most products are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products. \n\n\n\nThere are currently 4 RMP regulated substances present in 5 covered processes at the site. UCC handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the Institute site:\n\nEthylene Oxide\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nEthylenediamine\n\n\n\nUCC handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated flammable substance at the Institute site:\n\nIsopentane\n\n\n\nAn additional RMP covered process has been created for the Institute Site called Transportation Storage, which involves ethylene oxide rail cars that have been transported into the site and parked on the rail spurs until needed at the unloading rac"

      "SummaryText": "k.  These rail cars are collectively addressed as a separate process since these rail cars are not under active shipping papers and are not yet connected to the EO Distribution system.\n\n\n\nMaximum threshold inventory quantities of ethylene oxide have increased for RMP Processes at Institute due to the shared quantity associated with interconnecting pipeline to the distribution header, storage tanks, and railcar unloading rack (in addition to in-process quantities).  Additionally, ethylene oxide quantities have been revised for the 2014 RMP resubmittal according to the following:\n\n\n\n?    Estimated EO quantities from connected rail cars at the unloading rack have increased due to average rail car capacity increase.\n\n?    EO storage tank capacity has been revised to reflect more accurate estimation methods, which resulted in a decrease.\n\n\n\nThree toxic alternative scenarios are included for this resubmittal.  The 2009 RMP provided four alternative scenarios including two ethylene oxide alternative scenarios.  Only one toxic alternative scenario is required for each RMP toxic chemical above threshold, therefore the redundant scenario was removed.\n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Institute Site has been revised.  The EO storage tanks at the Institute Site are completely buried under an earthen mound topped with an impervious outer layer.  Upon release a limited amount of the liquid will flash; the unique mounding approach will help prevent spreading of the remaining liquid release and provides mitigating effects typically associated with permanently installed diking.  As the RMPComp tool does not consider the impact a dike can have on the release of a liquefied gas under pressure, UCC determined that utilization of the PHAST Version 6.7 model is best suited to provide representative worst-case release estimations for an Institute EO tank. \n\n\n\nRevision:  EO storage tanks have historically served as the basis for the worst-case scenario due to the largest quantity of the c"

      "SummaryText": "hemical associated with the tanks and greatest offsite impact.  The above-mentioned modeling efforts in 2014 focused on applying release mitigating credits to the covering of the EO storage tanks, which effectively reduced the distance-to-endpoint release impact.  Due to these modeling credits of the tank coverings, the EO rail car at Transportation Storage becomes the worst-case scenario, while being the second largest volume of ethylene oxide at the site.  The RMP is being resubmitted to reflect this change.\n\n\n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario for the Institute Site has been revised.  Isopentane is no longer transported into the Site via rail car, and is now utilizing tank trucks.  Where tank trucks have a much lower storage capacity than a rail car, the isopentane storage tank now becomes the source of largest quantity in a single vessel or piping, and is the basis for the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nUCC facilities at the Institute site have had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no significant releases with off-site impact as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUnion Carbide's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System and standards. Key elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters\n\nand equipment designs associated with all covered processes. Examples include, but are not limited to,\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and\n\nreactive chemicals test results. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating\n\npersonnel.\n\n\n\nProces"
