      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention policy at this facility is proper employee training and tank handling procedures during transfer, connection and disconnection of chlorine storage tanks; also training in proper maintenance of storage and process equipment.  The emergency response policy is to determine the nature of the release, and if it is a major release then 911 will be called to notify the Lafayette Fire Department/HAZMAT and the Lafayette Police Department and wait for them to respond.  In the event of a minor leak, plant personnel will mitigate the leak themselves.\n\nThe stationary source consists of four (4) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine. \n\nThe worst case release scenario would consist of a rupture of the one ton cylinder of chlorine allowing all of the chlorine inside to be released in ten minutes, which would create a chloud of chlorine with a radius of 1.3 miles and have an effected population of 22,000 people.  There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severity of the release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of a fusible plug blowing out of the chlorine cylinder.  It will take approximately an hour for HAZMAT to respond to the release.  It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.1 miles and effect 120 people.  There is no active or passive mitigation in place at the facility.\n\nProper training of operators and maintenance personnel prevents accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\nThere have been no accidents at the facility in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program for the facility is based on HAZWOPER guidelines.  All operators and maintenance personnel are properly trained in the use of PPE at the facility and how to handle emergencies related to an accidental release of chlorine."
