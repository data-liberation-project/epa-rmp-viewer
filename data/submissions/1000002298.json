      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSweetwater Authority senior management is not only committed to offer a superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program which promotes a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding community.  The Safety Coordinator administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Safety Coordinator periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Robert A. Perdue Water Treatment Plant (referenced throughout this document as the Sweetwater Authority facility) uses a chlorine system to treat water.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to purify the water.  The chlorine is delivered to the facility in one ton containers, which are then connected to the water treatment system, as needed.  The liquid chlorine leaves the one ton containers and enters the evaporators, which turns the liquid chlorine into a gas.  The chlorine gas then proceeds to the chlorinators, where it is pulled into the injectors, which then sends the chlorine into the water distribution system.\n\nIn the Chlorine Storage Room at Sweetwater Authority there are two chlorine tanks connected to the chlorine system (only one is used at a time).  The controller in the Chlorine Storage Room monitors the weight of each one ton chlorine container.  When the tank in operation is close to empty, the controller shuts off the valve connected to that tank and opens the valve connected to the full tank.  The empty tank is then replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by Sweetwater Authority op"

The aqueous ammonia is stored in a 6,000-gallon storage tank, which is located within a containment berm.  Two feed pumps are used to draw aqueous ammonia from the Storage Tank, which is then transferred to the effluent for water treatment.\n\nThe maximum total inventory of 29% aqueous ammonia is 46,260 pounds (6,000 gallons).\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nChlorine System\n\nIn order to operate the chlorine water treatment system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Level 3; and\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Level 3.\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Sweetwater Authority to prevent the accidental release of chlorine from the facility. The Operating Procedures program ensures that the chlorine system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the chlorine system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before chlorine is first introduced into a new or modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Sweetwa"

The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of chlorine and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine gas detectors are located in the Chlorine Storage Room, the Chlorinator Room, the Chlorine Dioxide Room, Chlorine Dioxide Day Tank Area, and the lower staircase.  There are also smoke and heat detectors located throughout the facility.\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the Sweetwater Authority facility is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program 1.  The aqueous ammonia system is checked by operators on a daily basis.\n\nSweetwater Authority maintains tight control of its aqueous ammonia system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there is a containment basin surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank that can hold more than 144% of the tankA?s liquid capacity.\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\nChlorine System\n\nAn investigation into the facilityA?s accident history revealed that in the last five years (March 2004 A? March 2009), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of A?anyA? release at the Sweetwater Authority. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\nThere have been no significant rele"

March 2009).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nChlorine System\n\nSweetwater Authority has a Hazardous Materials Response Team that is trained to respond to chlorine emergencies.  All personnel at the facility are at the first responder operations level.  While a large majority of the employees are at the First Responder Technician Level, some personnel are at the Incident Commander Level.  The operators and maintenance technicians are trained in the use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and chlorine repair kits (Type B Kit).  Annual refresher courses are held for the Sweetwater Authority operators, maintenance staff, and laboratory staff which deal with the procedures for handling hazardous materials.  During the suit-up drills, which are conducted annually, mock cylinders are used to simulate a release.  In addition, B Kits are used for practice on a quarterly basis.  The local police, fire, and hazardous materials agencies have been integrated into the facility response plan.\n\nIn the event of an emergency on the chlorine system, authorized staff will attempt to isolate the cause of the emergency by activating the Emergency Shutoff System first and notify management and the local authorities, as necessary.  The in-house HazMat Team will wear the proper safety equipment (a positive, pressure-demand, full-face piece, self contained, breathing apparatus or pressure demand supply air respirator with escape and a fully encapsulated, chemical resistant suit is required for response) prior to entering the emergency location.\n\nIn order to perform an emergency shutdown, an opera"

In the event of an emergency on the aqueous ammonia system, authorized staff will attempt to isolate the cause of the emergency by shutting off the feed pumps and notifying management and the in-house HazMat Team, as necessary.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChlorine System\n\nIn September 1994, the chlorine system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, PHA Revalidations were conducted in March 1999, June 2004, and February 2009. The 2009 PHA Revalidation consisted of:\n\n1.  A review of the PHA Requirements / History (Overview / Training Session);\n2.  A detailed review of the recommended action items from the 1995 Initial Process Hazard Analysis, 1999 PHA Revalidation Study, and 2004 PHA Revalidation Study; \n3.  An equipment list review;\n4.  A detailed review of any changes to the chlorine system since the 2004 study (reviewed Management of Change Records);\n5.  A discussion of any releases of chlorine since the 2004 study (review of Incident Investigation Records);\n6.  Development of HAZOP log sheets;\n7.  Completion of Emergency Response, Chlorine Checklist, Chlorine What-If Questions, and External Events checklists; and\n8.
