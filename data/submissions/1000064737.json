Description of the Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Policies\r\nUFC takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  UFC has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained associates to respond quickly to system upsets.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Stationary Source is the ammonia refrigeration system which is the only substance and process covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations at this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has a PSM/RMP Program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program and also serves as the Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The PSM/RMP Program consists of the following elements:\r\nManagement Systems\r\nEmployee Participation Program\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining Program\r\nContractor Safety Program\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\nMechanical Integrity Program\r\nHot Work Permit Procedures\r\nManagement of Change Procedures\r\nIncident Investigation Procedures\r\nCompliance Audit Procedures\r\nEmergency Action Procedures\r\nHazard Assessment\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\n\r\nD.  Five-Year Accident History"

Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will react to ammonia spills or releases and other potential emergencies, including both shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies including the Campbell Fire Department and the Corning Haz Mat Team. \r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system by conducting both Compliance Audits and PHA's which generated recommendations to improve the safety of the system.  All recommendations are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP Program."
