An accidental release of a regulated substance would be detected by strategically-located VOC monitors that would immediately alert production personnel.  All drums and cylinders are leakproof-tested after filling;  canisters are randomly leak-tested each day of operation.  All tankcars are physically disconnected, valved-off, and capped during off-hours.  Security fencing exists around the entire production facility.\n\nB.  An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared and submitted to the Colleton County LEPC and the Green Pond Fire Department specifying a response and warning system in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The facility also conducts quarterly evacuation drills according to the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA.  The primary activity is the repackaging of chemicals into drums, cylinders, and canisters for medical sterilization businesses and for synthesis customers.\n\nB.  The regulated substances are: \n           - Ethylene Oxide  \n           - Propylene Oxide   \n           - Methyl Chloride \n\n3.  RELEASE SCENARIO\n     --------------------------------\n\nA.  Worst Case\n           - Toxic Gas    \n                  Ethylene Oxide tankcar rupture with release of 100% of capacity (171000 lbs) in 10 minutes.  \n\nB.

PREVENTION\n     --------------------\n\nA.  All three regulated substances at the Green Pond plant are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     ------------------------------------------------\n\nA.  There have been no accidental releases of any regulated substance during the past five years.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     ---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA.  Evacuation drills have been conducted quarterly since 1997.  An evaluation of each drill is completed and changes are made based on the findings.\n\nB.  Walkie-talkies are used as a communication device in case of an emergency.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n     ----------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nA.  In 2003, a plant sprinkler and deluge system was installed for both fire and spill protection.  A 250,000-gallon emergency water supply tank and a water-recovery and containment pond were also installed.  Individual emergency shutoff valves were added at each Ethylene Oxide tankcar for remote operation in case of an emergency.  Safety cages were added at the tankcar platforms to minimize the possibility of accidental falls.\n\nB.  A recently-completed safety improvement was the addition of a ventilation system at all bulk ethylene oxide and propylene oxide fill stations in order to contain all traces of volatile gases.  In addition, a drum clamp was added to the forklift for easier transport of drums and less physical lifting for production personnel.  Plant security has been upgraded in that all gates are kept locked, additional fencing has been added, and security checks are conducted routinely."
