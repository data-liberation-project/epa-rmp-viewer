This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Monterey County LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass processing of fresh vegetables, primarily salads.  The plant is located at 1085 Abbot Street, Salinas CA 93901-4501 in Monterey County.  The location of the plant in relation to the community of Salinas is depicted in Figure 1, Facility Plot Plan.  The latitude and longitude of the facility is 36039'22\" N / 121037'59\".\n\nWe have one regulated substance, ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the cooling, cleaning, and packaging of vegetables.  The maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 18,000 lb.\n\n\n3  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the dispersion modeling software program ALOHA and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic relea"

      "SummaryText": "se from the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  The scenario involves the release of 9,900 lb. of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  No credit has been taken for existing active and passive mitigation systems that, if used, are likely to reduce the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios have been submitted for ammonia present in the process.\n\nThe first alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from the Ammonia Refrigeration System process.  The scenario involves the release of 560 lb. of ammonia in a liquid form over 8 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include operator intervention.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.23 miles.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario also involves a release from the Ammonia Refrigeration System process.  This scenario involves the release of 2,142 lb. of ammonia in the gaseous form over an hour through a pressure relief valve.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include operator intervention.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.09 miles.\n\n\n4  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and 19 CCR '2735.5 of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.   The Ammonia Refrigeration process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the CalOSH standard under 8 CCR '5189(d).  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requir"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the CalARP program, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  River Ranch Fresh Foods has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a ammonia occur.\n\n\n5 Five-year Accident History\n\nRiver Ranch Fresh Foods has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only two accidental releases have occurred during this period.  These releases took place on February 27, 1995 and involved 50 lbs. of ammonia and the other July 5, 1995 and involved 30 lbs. of ammonia.  The first incident was a result of human error, and the second mechanical failure.  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of either of these accidents.  Onsite, there was one (1) employee who was affected by the first accident and twenty-five (25) employees by the second accident.\n\n\n6  Emergency Response Plan\n\nRiver Ranch Fresh Foods carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
