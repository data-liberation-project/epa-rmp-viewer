The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nPetromax Refining Company, LLC (Petromax) will operate a newly constructed Crude Oil/Condensate Fractionation facility in Houston, Texas.\n\nIt is Petromax' policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Crude Oil Fractionation facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. \n\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (listed in 40 CFR ?68.130) will be handled at the facility.  The plant will handle flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating.  Safety precautions are in place when handling flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of personnel, contractors, the community and the environment.  \n\nPetromax facility Emergency Response Plan (ERP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance. The ERP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release. All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures. The ERP also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, applicable regulatory agencies, North Channnel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and Channelview Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Petromax Crude Oil/Condensate Fractionation facility will have daily processing rate of 25,000 BPD with a 10% margin.  Crude oil/condensa"

The crude/condensate feed is preheated and desalted to remove entrained saltwater and contaminants.  The feed is pumped to the Crude Charge Heater and sent to the Fractionation Column where the petroleum fractions separate.  \n\nThree product streams, light distillate, middle distillate, and heavy distillate are removed from side draws off the Fractionation Column at different levels.  Each material passes through a stripper vessel and heat exchangers after leaving the column, is cooled and sent to storage in rundown tanks.  These products are then pumped from the rundown tanks to final storage tanks before being delivered offsite.  Atmospheric gas oil (AGO) leaves the column bottom and is pumped to storage tank.  \n\nLight distillate, middle distillate, and heavy distillateand AGO are mixtures that do not meet the criteria for an NFPA 4 mixture, since they all have flash points above 73?F (22.8?C) and a boiling points above 100?F (37.8?C).\n\nThe lightest hydrocarbons are vaporized and leave the Fractionation Column in the overhead product stream.  The overheads are cooled and condensed and a portion sent back to the column as reflux.  The remaining material is further separated into a naphtha product stream and LPG.  Naphtha contains a regulated substance above one percent but the entire mixture does not meet the NFPA-4 criteria, since the boiling point is above 100?F. \n\nLPG is compressed and pumped to four pressurized bullet tanks after processing to remove entrained water.  LPG is loaded into tank trucks for delivery offsite.  LPG is considered a flammable mixture that meets the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and is handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.   The mixture contains the following regulated chemicals: butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane and propane. \n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Release Scenario and Alter"

      "SummaryText": "native Release Scenarios\n\na.      Worst Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the greatest amount of flammable mixture (D-108 LPG Storage Tank) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. There are two LPG Storage tanks with the same capacity at the facility. The LPG storage tank considered for the scenario was chosen based on the proximity to the boundary of the facility. The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: butane, isobutane, propane, isopentane, and n-pentane. It is assumed that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage (i.e. the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture) in this case this substance is butane.\n\nThe entire weight of the mixture (maximum liquid capacity of D-108) is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved an uncontrolled release of 291,000 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.5 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F). \n\n  \n\nb.    Alternative Case Scenarios:\n\nTwo alternative cases were evaluated.  The first scenario considers the potential loading hose failure (due to sudden uncoupling) from the LPG loading area resulting in vapor cloud explosion. The internal diameter (ID) of the hose was estimated at 2.75 inches. The release rate of 5,540 lb/min for the selected chemical (butane) was calculated using RMPComp.   RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.06 miles to 1 psi overpressure endpoint resulting from a vapor cloud explosion with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).\n\nThe second scenario was a 3 inch hole or puncture on the vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (LPG Storage Tank D-108) resulting in vapor cloud fire.

Therefore, only the two alternative cases described above were analyzed even though they were relatively pessimistic scenarios. \n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\nPetromax Crude Oil Fractionation facility is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained. \n\nProcess Hazards Analyses were conducted on the process to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Major hazards identified include fire, over-pressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure.  Process controls in place include vents, relief valves, check valves, facility flare, manual and automatic shutdowns, interlocks, grounding, interlocks, backup pumps, emergency air supply, emergency power, alarms and procedures. \n\nClassroom and on-the-job type trainings are conducted on site.  Written testing as well as observation and demonstration are used as means to verify understanding.  \n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear written instructions for conducting activities safely. SOPs address operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. SOPs are revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the process"

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place that will perform inspection and tests on equipment and correct any equipment deficiencies and apply quality assurance measures. The facility has both predictive and preventative maintenance programs which include inspections, tests and routine maintenance activities that are performed by trained and competent employees and contractors.  Inspection and testing frequencies are prescribed by manufacturers and industry standards.  \n\nA non-routine work authorization program ensures that appropriate measures are taken any time non-routine operations are performed on or near process areas that might initiate or promote a release.\n\nFacility and process changes are managed through a management-of-change (MOC) program.  The MOC program outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before the change is implemented.  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility's PSSR procedure. \n\nThe facility has an active accident/incident prevention program.

The investigation's purpose is to identify root and contributing causes and to make recommendations to prevent future recurrence.
