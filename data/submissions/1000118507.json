NGL management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe North Stratford rail siding is leased by NGL and NGL owns the product stored onsite.  At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids. Propane (odorized) is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the North Stratford rail siding in amounts above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by NGL. These high standards include:\n\nOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\nOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized. Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nCorrecting non-compliance found during regular audits"

However, they do operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the NGL North Stratford rail siding within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Twin State Mutual Aid Association.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Coos County Emergency Management Committee.  The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. \n\nThe hazard review provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of the potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\nThe maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of"
