      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Program (RMP) has been developed and a Risk Management Plan (hereafter referred to as \u00bfthe Plan\u00bf) has been prepared for use and storage of anhydrous ammonia in the Nash Finch Company (Cedar Rapids, Iowa facility) refrigeration system. The RMP and the Plan meet and address the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\n\nThis executive summary briefly describes the following elements: \n\n\u00bfThe stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n\u00bfThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source; \n\u00bfThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario; \n\u00bfThe five-year accident history; \n\u00bfThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n\u00bfThe emergency response program; and \n\u00bfPlanned changes to improve safety. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Nash Finch Company (Cedar Rapids, Iowa facility) refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes. \n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\nA \u00bfWorst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\u00bf and an \u00bfAlternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\u00bf were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm."

      "SummaryText": "The results are mitigated by the fact that most of the refrigeration equipment is inside the Cedar Rapids, Iowa facility\u00bfs building.\n\nThe facility has had no reportable ammonia releases within the last five years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Nash Finch Company is implementing a Process Safety Management (PSM) program (Preventative Program 3) developed for their facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Preventative Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure system mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so that the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 9 of this RMP. Nash Finch Company has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Nash Finch Company will conduct scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. \n\nNash Finch Company will incorporate or address practicable recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, Incident Investigations, and Program Audits. The flexibility of the program allows Nash Finch Company to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing Nash Finch Company employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
