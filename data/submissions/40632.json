Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. As the company responsible for operating the SEC, Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe SEC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendment of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment. The SEC has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe SEC is located approximately 7.5 miles southwest of Yuba City, California in Sutter County.

The plant is a merchant facility marketing the electrical power on the open power exchange market and ancillary service support to the California Independent Systems Operator (CAL-ISO) grid. The plant is located on a 38-acre parcel. \r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 26-ton steel bulk storage tank. Ammonia is used at the SEC to reduce NOx created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two combustion turbine generators (CTG) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) duct burners. Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the tow selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the SEC exceeds the federal RMP and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP and CalARP regulations.\r\n\r\nRelief valves. Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure. All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment. All liquid and vapor piping from the storage tank are equipped with excess-flow valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nContainment Area: The ammonia storage tank is located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain the full contents of the vessel, 24 hours of rain fall as determined by the 25-year storm and deluge water for 20 minutes as determined by code.\r\n\r\nLeak detectors: Four ammonia leak detector transmitters are provided to detect major leakage and alarm locally and in the Control Room in the event of an ammonia leak.

SEC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. We believe that this program is the primary line of defense against a release. Maintenance staff address equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training of these procedures.  Our mechanical integrity program includes the following:\r\n\r\n* Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing or process equipment, based on instructions or equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience\r\n* Implementation of written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals\r\n* Training of maintenance personnel in safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions\r\n* Procedures specifying training requirements for contract maintenance employees, as well as requiring contractors to use plant developed maintenance procedures for process areas\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change\r\n\r\nSEC requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the regulated processes.

The detectors trigger an alarm when a concentration of 150 ppm of ammonia is detected in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlarm Systems:  The ammonia process is checked at least twice during every 12-hour shift as part of the normal rounds at SEC. The storage tank is provided with a local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume). The tank also has pressure safety valves, temperature gauges, and ammonia leak detectors. Indication and alarms for tank level, temperature, and pressure are displayed on the local control panel and Control Room Distributed Control System (DCS). An ammonia vaporizer alarm is also provided in the Control Room DCS.\r\n\r\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash: An emergency eyewash and shower are provided at the truck unloading station near the ammonia storage tank.\r\n\r\nDeluge System: A deluge water system is provided around the storage tank to dissipate the ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak. The system will be manually activated locally at the ammonia tank or from the Control Room in the event of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nFire Safe Stop Valve: An emergency fire safe stop valve is provided on the main vapor line from the storage tank. This stop valve is wired directly to the DCS. In the event of a fire or ammonia spill, the operator is to manually initiate a valve closure from the DCS. Limit switches on the valve will indicate the valve position in the Control Room DCS.\r\n\r\nAccess to the SEC from South Township Road is controlled by two gates on the east side of the plant, the northern most of which is the main entrance gate. The two gates remain closed at all times. The main gate is equipped with a security camera and call box and is controlled locally and remotely from the Control Room.

The worst-case release scenario requires that a release of the entire contents of the single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for offsite impacts. Only passive or administrative controls can be considered under the worst-case release scenario. The worst-case release scenario for the SEC is the rupture of an ammonia bulk storage tank, resulting in a release of 53,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute duration. In practice, this type of total release of a bulk tank would be extremely unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe released liquid is assumed to quickly volatize an disperse as a vapor cloud. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the Arial Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model. The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP was 200 ppm. All required EPA model input parameters were included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions-Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (115 degrees F), and average humidity (67 percent). The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst-case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an impact to receptors offsite.\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario for each regulated substance is also required. The alternative release scenario is a release scenario more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. Unlike the worst-case release scenario, active controls can be considered in analyzing the impacts of an alternative release scenario. Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input. The alternative release scenario used for ammonia was a small leak in the process piping. T"

SEC's training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers: (1) a general overview of the processes, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify  that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed.\r\n\r\nTraining documentation includes: date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training. On-going employee training records are maintained.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe SEC has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the ammonia process. Contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work. The SEC sets minimum contractor safety performance requirements for work in process areas, h"

This system allows our employees to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information before the proposed change is implemented.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted periodically to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP. Calpine assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the regulatory process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSEC investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, so that similar accidents can be prevented. SEC trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation. An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of any incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. Information found during the investigation is reviewed by appropriate staff and is added to , or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures. Information from audits and any resulting changes in operating procedures are passed onto the training unit for their inclusion in existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent a future event.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History Summary\r\n\r\nEPA and CalARP RMP regulations require reporting the 5-year accident history of the covered processes. The details of accidental releases are required for accidents that have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n* Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\r\n* Known offsite deaths,"

This program has been coordinated (reviewed) by the Sutter County Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC). This program includes and emergency action and notification plan. Emergency operation and action procedures are also reviewed once per year.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nDuring the process hazard analysis, several additional risk reduction measures were recommended to improve safety at the SEC. These measures included installing a third ammonia leak detector near where the ammonia is mixed with air, installing a safety chain with a Check Hoses sign to remind ammonia delivery drivers to disconnect hoses, adding a pressure gauge on the ammonia fill line, addition of a local deluge activation switch, installation of a fire extinguisher near the ammonia storage tank, and marking the path of the underground ammonia vapor lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9/7/04"
