The procedures address various aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release with off-site consequences occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, FHR has procedures that are designed to address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that are to be used to address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. When necessary, the emergency response program changes are administered through the Safety Department, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for FHR is coordinated with FHR Emergency Response Team, RTFC, Local Emergency Response Agencies and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). FHR has around-the-clock communications capability with these organizations. At least four times a year, FHR's Emergency Response Team conducts drills that are evaluated for effectiveness if an emergency should ever occur. This drill is intended to provide a means to ensure the emergency public notification system is in working order, as well as facilitate practice and orderly response to potential emergency events.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nFHR's policy is to pursue continuous improvement through the use of tools such as follows:\r\n- Continued employee process safety training;\r\n- Improved Safe Operating Limit Repository;\r\n- Improved Contractor onboarding process;\r\n- Improved Reliability Operating Practices;\r\n- Refreshed Safe Work Practice policies;\r\n- Improved Managem"

The MSQ is FHR's initial screening process for accepting a contract employer to work at the refinery and also used as an ongoing screening tool to renew and approve continued support from contract employers.\r\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place designed to oversee that contractors:\r\n- perform work in a safe manner,\r\n- have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\r\n- are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\r\n- understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\r\n- understand and follow site safety rules, and\r\n- inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work permitting process prior to beginning work. In addition, FHR's practice is to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nFHR's policy is to conduct a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR also involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program req"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. In addition, the PHA team can use a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in some scenarios, where appropriate, to help further evaluate the controls in place\r\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel. Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is intended to help ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. PHA action items are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System. Within this system, an employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date. Responsible employees are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date. For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR's practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is available on the FHR Intranet.\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR's policy is to implement a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. This RMP is for FHR East Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. \r\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing. For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR East refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining'. The information provided within this submittal was collected and compiled in April 2020.\r\nFHR's emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, in-plant industrial emergency response group (Refinery Terminal Fire Company - RTFC). In addition, over fifty trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary due to the Corpus Christi Port Industrial consortium. Another aspect of our emergency response capabilities is notification of our adjacent neighbors through the Crisis Management Dispatch (CMD), a computerized calling network capable of simultaneous calling to pre-determined calling zones, and Radio Broadcast FM 87.5.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nFHR operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from raw crude oil.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. For all process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFHR's policy is to encourage employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention programs. Examples of employee participation included updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention. These processes include teams such as the Central Environmental Health and Safety Council (CEHSC), Hazard Recognition Team (HRT), and the Refinery Process Safety Committee (RPSC). These teams contain members from across the refinery, including employees from operations, maintenance, engineering, as well as refinery management.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nFHR's policy is to maintain technical documents that are to be used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit operating procedures. The refinery maintains these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nWithin the PHA program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards.
