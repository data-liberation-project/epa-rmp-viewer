The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Panola II Gas Plant is coordinated with the Panola County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). The Panola II Gas Plant has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Panola II Gas Plant will conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and will provide periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Panola II Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Panola II Gas Plant.\r\n\r\n* No planned changes."

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Panola II Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n*Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\r\n*Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\r\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the facility.  The cryogenic skid contains a 35,000 gal pressurized steel tank for product (NGL) storage.  The components of NGL (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and pentane) are classified as regulated flammable substances and are present in the product in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.osed process vessels. \r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Panola II Gas Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Panola II Gas Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included"
