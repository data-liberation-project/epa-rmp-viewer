These precautions include safety controls, Ammonia Detection\nwith Audible/Visual detectors, Emergency Ventilation, Emergency Shutoffs, Equipment\nSafeties, Safety Shutdowns, spring loaded valves, and Pressure Relief Valves for\npressure vessels which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe\nconditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a\npreventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the\nsystems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by\nqualified personnel, and emergency action procedures that enable trained personnel to\nrespond quickly to system upsets.\nWe are committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and\nthe surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire\ncodes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In\naccordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(29CFR1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40CFR68) our priority is to\nprevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to\nproblems.\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility.
