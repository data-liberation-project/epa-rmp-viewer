The site was formerly owned by DuPont and operated as an explosives and chemical manufacturing facility from approximately 1890 to 1980.  Chemours became the owner of record of the site in April 2015 and DRP acquired the site in June 2016. The site is being redeveloped into a multi-modal deep-water seaport by DRP. The site features an existing underground cavern that was previously mined out of metamorphic rock in approximately 1965. The cavern was previously used by DuPont for the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n \r\nCavern storage and loading areas are located near the Delaware River, at the north of the site and about one mile from the site entrance.  The cavern has been refurbished to receive, store, and distribute Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), specifically refinery-grade butane.  The cavern is located between 340 and 370 feet below the ground surface and has a storage capacity of approximately 7.8 million gallons (1 million cubic feet). The cavern and loading facilities were approved by the NJDEP for operation under the TCPA Risk Management Program, signed and dated 6/22/2017. A Major Modification to this approved RMP includes the addition of propane to the facility registration, additional rail car and truck transloading operations (landside) and the addition of a deep water port, constructed according to recommended industry specifications and operation under the jurisdiction of the USCG.  \r\n  \r\nLPG is a flammable substance and can be present as a liquid or a vapor (gas). The DRP transloading facility is designed in accordance with modern safety standards. The design, construction and operation includes all applicable codes and standards and industry best practices to prevent impact to human health and the environment.  \r\n\r\n1.

In addition, an enclosed emergency flare system has been installed to collect and safely destroy flammable gas in case of an emergency. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe transloading system is subject to significant safety regulation, including construction approval and oversight by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  The TCPA program incorporates all the elements of the the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). \r\n\r\n4.\tTransportation of LPG into and out of the site by truck or railcar is highly regulated by the US Department of Transportation (DOT). DRP is also a registered member of CHEMTREC, who is a leader in 24 hour Emergency Response and incident management.\r\n\r\n5.\tDRP conducts annual emergency preparedness exercise with local and county emergency responders.  The local volunteer department is supported by the Gloucester County Department of Emergency Response which includes 911 dispatch, fire and emergency medical services, and a hazardous materials response team.\r\n\r\n6.\tIn addition to the design, prevention, and emergency response elements discussed above, the safety management program for the LPG Transloading Facility operation includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been conducted and documented for engineering design.
