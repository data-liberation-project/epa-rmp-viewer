(ERCO) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and to the protection of the environment.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling of chlorine.\n\nERCO is in compliance with the American Chemistry CouncilA?s Responsible Care Security Code.  A security vulnerability analysis has been conducted and ERCO has implemented comprehensive security procedures and improvements such as perimeter digital video camera system, improved perimeter lighting, and an access control system.  A transportation security plan has also been implemented including necessary training of affected employees.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs to ensure site integrity.  Examples of some such controls include:\n1)    Installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to over-pressurization,\n2)    Routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition,\n3)    Limiting inventory in chlorine storage tanks, and\n4)    Monitoring vessel and piping pressures.\n\nIf a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control a"

Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves which limit the amount of chemical released, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate personal protective equipment, and an alarm system for notification of a release.  Should a release occur, we use a dispersion model called the Systematic Approach for Emergency Response (SAFER), and meteorological data from our weather tower to predict the plume direction and size, downwind ground-level concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach off-site areas.  This information is communicated to 911 in cases of any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies.\n\nII.    Stationary Sources & Regulated Substances\nERCO is a chlor-alkali manufacturing facility.  Our products are liquefied chlorine, 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, 50% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, and 35% hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution.  \n\nSulfur dioxide is stored on-site in one-ton containers, 150-lb cylinders, and in a carbon steel, 6,154 gallon tank.  The sulfur dioxide is consumed in the chlor-alkali manufacturing process.    \n\nChlorine is used internally as raw material for the hydrochloric acid manufacturing process.  The remainder is liquefied and loaded into railcars and transported to our customers, where it is used in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes.  Please visit The Chlorine Institute at http:\\\\www.chlorineinstitute.org\\ for more information on the uses and benefits of chlorine.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are affected chemicals under 40CFR 68.  The affected process is chlorine production, including chlorine rail car loading.  The process is a RMP Level 3 program.  We use a combination of good design practices, release prevention programs, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nERCO takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  In addition to EPAA?s Chemical Accident Prevention regulation, the chlorine manufacturing process is also an affected source under OSHAA?s Process Safety Management regulation.  Our management system addresses the requirements of these systems as described in the sections that follow.\n\nIV.    Process Safety Information\nERCO maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  Plant personnel rely on these documents to perform their job functions properly, consistently and in a safe manner.  These documents are kept up-to-date and are available to all employees.  Process Safety Information will address important process parameters such as:\n1)    Operating limits for the equipment;\n2)    Design basis and configuration of the equipment; and\n3)    Physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in the process.\n\nChemical information is documented in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  MSDSs contain information concerning the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical.  MSDSs are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.\n\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents include:\n1)    Safe operating limits,\n2)    Block flow or simplified process flow diagrams,\n3)    Process chemistry,\n4)    Maximum intended inventories,\n5)    Pressure relief system design basis and configuration,\n6)    Piping and instrumentation diagrams, and\n7)    Other information that is important for understanding the design, limits, and hazards of each process.\n\nV.

Our hazard assessment focuses on preventing injuries to plant personnel and the community, and preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\nA hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) or a What if?/Checklist is typically used for a process hazard analysis.  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making recommendations for improvement when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are reviewed by management and are tracked until they are resolved.\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every 5 years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nVI.    Operating Procedures\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as: 1) unit start up; 2) normal operations; 3) temporary operations; 4) emergency shutdown; 5) normal shutdown; and 6) initial start-up of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are updated following process changes and are annually certified to ensure their accuracy.\n \nVII.    Training\nERCO trains workers to safe"

After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  Both classroom and on-the-job training is provided.  In addition to training in specific job functions, training is also provided on safe work practices.  The frequency of refresher training is decided upon with input from our employees and is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\nVIII.    Mechanical Integrity\nERCO maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program is intended to help identify equipment damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  Predictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, and ultrasonic analysis.  Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps and motors.  Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment.  And ultrasonic technology is used to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.

Management of Change\nWe review any changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measures are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that:\n1)    New hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system,\n2)    Safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed,\n3)    Operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and \n4)    All training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.\n\nThe management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\nX.    Pre-Startup Review\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, ERCO performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted.  A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that:\n1)    Construction and equipment are consistent with design standards;\n2)    Adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place;\n3)    Training for all affected employees is complete;\n4)    A process hazard analysis has been performed;\n5)    Process hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed; and\n6)    Actions required for start-up have been completed.\n\nXI.

Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and provide recommendations for ensuring that the incident does not recur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved.  Some examples of changes made as a result of incident investigations include developing new procedures or revising existing ones, changing equipment construction material, or requiring operations to perform additional monitoring.\n\nXII.    Employee Participation\nERCO encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and incident prevention.  Employees are routinely asked to participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, management of change, hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program, and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas.  The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan.\n\nXIII.    Safe Work Practices\nERCO has established safe work procedures and permits to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  Examples of these procedures include:\n1)    A daily safe work permit-job specific;\n2)    A hot work permit that is designed to control spark or flame-producing activities;\n3)    A permit and procedure to control confined space entry; and\n4)    A lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance.\n\nXIV.

Compliance Audits\nCompliance audits are performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  ERCO performs Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) of all manufacturing processes at the plant, not just those required by EPA and OSHA.  This process combines plant-specific and process-specific knowledge of ERCOA?s engineers, supervisors, operators and maintenance technicians, plus the knowledge base from our sister plants, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with OSHA and EPA regulations and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nXVI.    Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe prevention program previously described ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error.  In addition to the prevention program, ERCO has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\n1)    Release detection\na.    Chlorine detectors in the production, storage and loading areas\nb.    Video surveillance of the loading/unloading area\nc.    Procedures requiring that plant operators inspect their work area on a routine schedule\n2)    Release containment and control\na.    Valves to permit isolation of the process\nb.    Automated shutdown systems for some process parameters (e.g. high level, high pressure)\nc.    Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\nd.    Pressure relief valves and rupture disks\ne.    Excess flow valves on the chlorine storage tanks and rail cars\n3)    Release mitigation\na.    Fire suppression equipment, pre-connected fire hoses & fire extinguishers are located throughout the plant\nb.    Trained emergency response personnel\nc.    Personal protective equipment (e.g. protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nXVII.    Five-Year Accident History  \nThere had been one reportable chlorine incident during the past 5 years which resulted in equipment damage and one minor chlorine inhalation.\n\nThere have been no off-site injuries or environmental damage as a result of a chemical release from this facility during the past 5 years.\n\nXVIII.    Emergency Response Program\nERCO maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment.  The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, evacuation plans, and community emergency response notification procedures.\n\nProcedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan. There are procedures that address maintenance, inspecting, testing,"

Employees receive periodic training in the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency, and any change in the emergency response plan is administered through the management of change process so that affected employees are notified.\n\nThe emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.  This includes periodic meetings among community responders and facility representatives so that they are aware of the hazards of our processes.  Communication channels with local responders are kept open 24-hours per day.  This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release.  We periodically conduct emergency response drills so that all participants are familiar with their duties during an emergency.\n\nERCO maintains a CitizenA?s Advisory Panel (CAP) to gather public input regarding our operations.  This includes growth plans, transportation issues, public safety, and our emergency response plans.  Members of the CAP at this time include school officials, neighbors, the County Sheriff, a local chemist, a science teacher, the Director A? Emergency Government, and employees of our industrial neighbors.\n\nXIX.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nERCO continuously strives to improve the safety of our processes.  Suggestions for improving safety are regularly addressed through process hazard analyses, management of change procedures, incident investigations, and employee suggestions.  \n\nERCO is in compliance with the American Chemistry CouncilA?s Responsible Care Security Code.  A security vulnerability analysis has been conducted and ERCO has implemented comprehensive security procedures and improvements such as a perimeter digital video camera system, improved perimeter lighting, and an access control system.  A transportation security plan has also been implemented including necess"
