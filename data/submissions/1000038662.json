Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nGulf Coast Cold Storage is a cold storage facility and logistics service organization located in Pascagoula, MS. The facilities primary business is the short and long term storage of food products and stevedoring operations.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration process used to maintain freezer temperatures utilizes anhydrous ammonia (R717) as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as refrigerant in many industrial facilities, including, meat, poultry, and fish processing facilities; and cold storage warehouses. The refrigerant serving as the heat transfer fluid is circulated thru a closed loop system.\r\n\r\nGulf Coast Cold Storage is committed to operating cold storage facilities under conditions that are safe to employees, contractors, tenants, and the surrounding community. The senior management is committed to this cause. As a result, the Safety Policy will be considered on an equal basis with productivity, efficiency, quality improvement, environmental issues and other policies developed by the Group. \r\n\r\nThe core of the facilities overall approach to safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system focuses on a hazard assessment program, employee and contractor training, an ongoing preventative maintenance program, and an emergency action program. We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases should they ever occur. Some examples include:\r\n\r\n* Regular and Routine Process Hazard Analysis.\r\n* Regular checklist audits of safety programs and records.\r\n* Emergency release training with employees and the local fire department.\r\n* Plant security: locks, lights, alarms, and warning signs.\r\n* Investigation of all incidents to improve our procedures.\r\n* Annual review and certification of standard operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe EPA requires all companies to report the release of hazardous materials.  While some accidents ma"

      "SummaryText": "y occur, we take great pride in our safety record and make every effort to ensure that they will be small and as infrequent as possible.\r\n\r\nFuture plans for the on-going Risk Management program include routine preventative maintenance of mechanical refrigeration systems. We also intend to continuously focus on employee development and training specific to safe operation of plant equipment, emergency response and employee evacuation.\r\n\r\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the refrigeration systems is documented in the Gulf Coast PSM Program. Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public and environmental impact, and is regulated under the OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program. \r\n\r\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. Through the use of single stage compression, the refrigeration system provides room temperatures of 0 to -10F and 2 blast cells with temperatures of -20F to -30F.\r\n\r\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machinery room areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining\r\nContractors\r\nPre-st"

Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWhile Gulf Coast Cold Storage prides itself on its safety program, a major fire occurred in our south freezer facility on December 10, 2013 which destroyed the entire structure.  Thanks to the diligence of the local fire department and our maintenance staff, there was little or no effect on the local community or employees of GCCS.\r\n\r\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has an Emergency Action Plan. This facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the LEPC for Jackson County.\r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nGulf Coast Cold Storage currently has no changes planned for the facility ammonia refrigeration processes at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Gulf Coast personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process through required compliance audits and management of change procedures."
