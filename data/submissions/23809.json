This regulation is published in 40 CFR Part 68. We have assessed and continue to review how accidental releases may occur, and how the public and the environment might be impacted. After reading this program, you may consider making recommendations for improvements to the Branch Operations Manager. Vopak, USA is a distributor of industrial chemicals. We store three substances that are regulated by the above cited Act at or above the threshold quantities; chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is a pungent greenish yellow gas or amber color in liquid form. The material is irritating to the skin and eyes, and is a toxic inhalation hazard. Chlorine is heavier than air and tends to settle in low areas. Chlorine is not flammable, but may support combustion. Hydrofluoric Acid is a colorless corrosive/poisonous liquid. It is a skin, eye, and inhalation hazard. The material is not flammable. Sulfur Dioxide is a colorless corrosive gas or liquid. It is a skin, eye, and inhalation hazard. The material has a pungent odor.\nWORST-CASE CHLORINE SCENARIO, ERPG 3_ Based on modeling, a complete failure and release of our largest container (2000 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 1.3 miles.\nALTERNATE RELEASE CHLORINE SCENARIO, ERPG 3_ Based on modeling, the alternate release of 10 pounds of chlorine may impact the surrounding area within 0.1 miles.\nWORST-CASE HYDROFLUORIC ACID SCENARIO, ERPG 3_ Based on modeling, the complete failure and release of our largest container (500 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 0.3 miles.\nALTERNATE RELEASE HYDROFLUORIC ACID SCENARIO, ERPG 3_ Based on modeling, the alternate release of 100 pounds of material may impact the surrounding area wit"

The plant alarm is sounded; 2. The facility coordinator is called to assess the release; 3. Fire department Hazardous Materials Team is called and the facility evacuated; 4. Richmond County Emergency Management Agency is notified; 5. Release is controlled and adequate cleanup and decontamination is performed. We have had no reportable releases in in the last five years."
