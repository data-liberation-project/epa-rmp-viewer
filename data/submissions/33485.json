This source contains anhydrous ammonia. The accidental release prevention policy at this facility is to maintain this equipment in good operating condition, have the equipment inspected annually by the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia, utilize contractors that have experience and training with maintaining anhydrous ammonia systems, and maintain an attendant during the transfer of ammonia to the storage tanks by the delivery truck. A process safety management plan is in place and incorporated into this risk management plan. All work conducted on this system is done through the Chemical Project Engineer. The Chemical Project Engineer is the emergency coordinator and primarily responsible for the risk management plan and its implementation. \n\nEmergency Response Policies:\nThis facility is required to have an emergency and contingency plan under RCRA, a process safety management plan under OSHA, and a spill prevention control and counter measures plan. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\nThe stationary source is two storage tanks and the distribution piping. These tanks contain anhydrous ammonia which is the regulated substance.\n\nRelease Prevention Program:\nThe accidental release prevention policy at this facility is to maintain this equipment in good operating condition, have the equipment inspected annually by the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia, utilize contractors that have experience and training with maintaining anhydrous ammonia systems and conduct inspections of our internal plumbing system, and maintain an attendant during the loading of the storage tanks by the delivery truck.

The relief\u00bfs are mounted on a three-way valve to allow a failed valve to be isolated and maintain protection with the second relief.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThis facility has not experienced an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the date of this submission.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nAll emergency response operations are directed by the emergency coordinator or in his absence one of the secondary emergency coordinators. Each of these individuals have a minimum of technicians level of training. Plant personnel are trained to notify the personnel listed on an Emergency Notification List when they discover an emergency situation. This call initiates the response of emergency response personnel and the emergency coordinator. These personnel then determine the type and degree of response necessary. The emergency coordinator is responsible for notifying the local emergency response agencies through the 911 system in the community. This call will activate the Van Wert County Emergency Management\u00bfs response plan for the type of emergency in progress. Their responsibility is to the community within the affected area. This facility is responsible for all personnel on its property. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nUpon completion of this plan and the recent Failure Modes and Effect Analysis this facility determined that the following changes are necessary to improve the safety of the operation.\n1) Replace the flow check valve leading from the ammonia storage area to the process and place it on a 5 year replacement program.\n2) Place an easily accessible valve to be able to quickly shut off the ammonia feed into the facility.\n3) Provide lockout capability for the fill lines on both tanks and maintain them locked.\n4) Add word \u00bfflammable\u00bf"
