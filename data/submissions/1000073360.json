      "SummaryText": "The Shell - Sewaren Terminal is an existing, onshore bulk storage fuel terminal located at 111 State Street, Sewaren, New Jersey 07077. The Terminal straddles State Street with most of its processing equipment and storage falling on the east side. The butane system is located on the west side. The Terminal is bounded on the east by the Arthur Kill Tidal Strait. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, diesel, butane, ethanol, and petroleum additives for distribution to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Sewaren, NJ.\n\n\n\nShell - Sewaren Terminal in Sewaren, NJ is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Shell believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment go hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HSE performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Sewaren Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Shell promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Shell has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC.

      "SummaryText": "ding/Unloading System has been classified as Program level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Shell - Sewaren Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Sewaren Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe Sewaren Terminal has variable inventories of butane. The Butane Railcar Offloading, Tank Blending, and Truck Loading/Unloading System provides the Sewaren Terminal the capability to offload butane from railcars and trucks and blend the butane into gasoline tanks. In addition, it also allows for the direct transfer of butane from railcars to tanker trucks. The system consists of one (1) truck loading/offloading rack with three (3) bays, one (1) rail spur holding up to nine (9) butane railcars with two (2) rail offloading locations, one (1) air-eliminator, one (1) vapor return pump, two (2) liquid butane pumps, and associated piping and appurtenances. Butane can be offloaded from either tanker trucks at the three (3) loading rack bays or from railcars at the two (2) railcar offloading locations. The butane is then transferred to one of twelve above-ground, floating roof storage tanks for blending with gasoline. The System also provides the Sewaren Terminal the capability to transfer butane from railcars directly into tanker trucks. Truck loading can occur at Loading Rack Bays 2 and 3. Process safety controls include: \"Smart Hose\" (or equivalent) break"

The supply lines to the pneumatic valves also incorporate low-melting point (<250?F) tubing for fire protection. Access to the Sewaren Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help to effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 and NJDEP TCPA Title 7, Chapter 31, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Sewaren Terminal:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5) EHS Operator Training\n\n6) Contractors\n\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9) Work Permits\n\n10) Management of Change\n\n11) EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\n12) Emergency Response\n\n13) Compliance Audits\n\n14) Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of the prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The company and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Sewaren Terminal also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the operating procedures and engineering an"
