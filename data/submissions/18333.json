The owners, management and employees of  Bader  Agricultural Service, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the Anhydrous Ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so that they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2. Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in the facility's tank.  The capacity of this storage tank is 30,000 gal.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario  would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.68 miles. \n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 2,901 pounds released over 2  minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .64 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of\nAgriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1  and OSHA 29 CFR       \n1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n5"

      "SummaryText": ". The Five-Year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or insignificant property damage on site: nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR  1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning   \nand community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action has been providedd to the local  fire department and provided to the emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
