Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.

The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released. For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1 and 2), the worst case release was modeled as if the 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature. For the aqua ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 3 and 4), the worst case release was modeled as if the 30,000-gallon aqua ammonia aboveground storage tank (AST) fails for some reason and releases all contents inside of the secondary containment at the maximum temperature.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to a transfer hose failure during a transfer event from the commercial tanker truck to the pressure vessel.  The alternative scenario for Covered Process 2 assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to a braided hose failure during a transfer event from the pressure vessel to the stationary pipe reactor (SPR).  The alternative scenario for Covered Process 3 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to a transfer hose failure during a transfer event from the commercial tanker truck to the AST.  The alternative scenario for Covered Process 4 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to a process pipe failure during"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to two of the covered processes operated at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule. All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.   \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 139,915 lbs, and the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at this Facility is 44,752 lbs (i.e. anhydrous ammonia equivalent).  Although the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 139,915 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 279,830 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel (i.e. 139,915 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Fertilizer Blending (APP) process that is connected to the single stationary pressure vessel.  Although the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at this Facility is 44,752 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 89,504 lbs.  The reason for this is because the maximum quantity of 23% anhydrous ammonia equivalent (i.e. 44,752 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Micronutrient Formulation process that is connected to the single stationary AST.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, fertilizer blending, and dist"

Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in each of the alternative scenarios.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Branch Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The PSM/RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, and 6 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Facility."
