This document has been prepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\n\n\n\n?  Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements (RMP).\n\n\n\n?  OSHA's Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Section 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to:\n\n\n\n?  Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\n?  Assist Legendary Baking's and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThis document addresses Legendary Baking's administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks.  The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. The facility utilizes an ammonia system to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage frozen pies.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nLegendary Baking is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nLegendary Baking's senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and env"

Legendary Baking's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the, Plant Manager, Maintenance Manager, and Refrigeration Operator who conduct inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Legendary Baking facility is located at 300 Hazeltine Drive in Chaska, Minnesota, which is approximately 1.5 miles north of Highway 212 and 1.0 miles west of Highway 41.  \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Legendary Baking is to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of frozen pies. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains two refrigeration systems.  The North System contains approximately 4,645 pounds of anhydrous ammonia while the South System contains 6,066 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Both systems contain a combined total of 10,711 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which meets the regulated threshold for anhydrous ammonia.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for processing and storage of frozen pies.  Typical operating conditions range from 10\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 150-180 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Legendary Baking's ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs and major repairs in house, but an outs"

      "SummaryText": "ide contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance as needed.\n\n\n\nThe facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the Engine Room.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room. All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to several common headers and relieve to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Legendary Baking's has developed a preventive maintenance program for in-house personnel to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis (July 26-27, 2016) revealed that there have been no ammonia releases over the past five years (July 2011 to July 2016) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.  \n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nLegendary Baking has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)

This Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted on July 26-27, 2016, included a HAZOP study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Legendary Baking facility.  The Legendary Baking safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.
