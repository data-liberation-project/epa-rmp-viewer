The Tullahoma Wastewater Treatment Plant (TWWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.\nAll applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The TWWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\nB. Tullahoma's wastewater treatment system has been installed to disinfect the flow out of the Tullahoma wastewater treatment plant located at 1012 South Franklin. The wastewater comes into wastewater plant, is treated, and flows out into Rock Creek. The treatment process includes the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are housed together in an enclosed building. The building contains six (6) ton cylinders of chlorine, and four (4) ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide. The storage area of the building contains four (4) additional ton cylinders of chlorine and four (4) ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide. Various types of safety equipment, monitoring devices, and control devices are housed within the building, as well as access to safety equipment inside and outside the building. The facility is monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week by on site personnel.\nC1. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two (2) chlorine scenarios identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\" as well as consideration of two (2) sulfur dioxide scenarios also identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\"\nThe first scenario as defined by EPA, whic"

The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\"\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 PPM, which is the emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" \nThe residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\nThe worst case scenario at the Tullahoma Wastewater Plant involves total loss of ton cylinder during delivery of chlorine, dropping a one ton cylinder onto concrete from 5 feet during unloading, shearing valve. The offsite worst consequence analysis for this scenario was performed by EPA's RMP Comp Program including worst case scenarios for chlorine. The conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use the one hour average as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.

The chlorine released is 1800 pounds, at an average rate of one hour, of 30 pounds/minute. Toxic endpoints were obtained using EPA RMP COMP Program. The EPA mandated meteorological conditions used were Stability Class D, wind speed 3 meters/second, average air temperature of 77 F. The estimated distances traveled to toxic endpoint 0.1 miles (0.2km).\nActivation of the two- (2) chlorine detectors is an active mitigation measure that should be considered. Both chlorine monitors will detect chlorine and give an alarm at 1 PPM and above. Both monitors are connected to the telemetry system for a remote monitoring system.  Fixed chlorine monitors are located in the chlorine cylinder  room and the controller  feed room. \nC2.
