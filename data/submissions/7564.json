The Tullahoma Wastewater Treatment Plant (TWWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.\nAll applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The TWWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\nB. Tullahoma's wastewater treatment system has been installed to disinfect the flow out of the Tullahoma wastewater treatment plant located at 1012 South Franklin.
