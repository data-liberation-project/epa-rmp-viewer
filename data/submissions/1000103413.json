AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager, and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at an AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals. In addition, the site complies with EPA\u0092s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained in the terminal\u0092s loading and Emergency Action Plan procedures and many have also been trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u0092s (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP)."

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures, and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter. The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines, and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via inspection and painting programs.\n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems are also installed on site. Shutdown systems include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment and isolate a problem once detected. Portable fire extinguishers are also available on site"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Spokane Terminal consists of west side and east side. The AmeriGas Spokane terminal is propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes four (4) above-ground storage tanks which each have a 30,000 gallon capacity. It also has two (2) Compressors used to unload the rail cars and one (1) Liquid Pump. There are two (2) bulkheads with no meters and one (1) bulkhead with a meter which is in the main one used to load transports.\n\nThe terminal has a siding with one (1) rail tower designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of compressors. Compressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tank and compress them or increase their pressure and discharges into the rail car to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the pressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid propane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks. Liquid propane is loaded to transports using liquid pumps.\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), complying with state of Washington regulations. Both plans include procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations. Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. Should an actual incident occur, the plans five guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on-site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise."
