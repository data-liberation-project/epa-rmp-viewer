Hilmar Cheese Company also has Nitric Acid used in some processes that is a CalARP Program 1, not subject to the federal RMP requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan (ERP) details the response this facility will take as a result of a release, or impending release, of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This ERP also includes a specific protocol for responding"

The facility lies to the west of State Highway 160 (Lander Avenue) north of the town of Hilmar and north of August Avenue.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of agricultural lands, light commercial and office areas, and residential areas.\n\nThis facility manufactures and stores cheese products for wholesale distribution.  The facility areas include offices, production buildings, a wastewater treatment facility, parking, a visitors center, warehouses, loading/unloading docks and areas, raw material tank storage, and three ammonia refrigeration systems, one bulk aqueous ammonia system and dilute Nitric Acid.  The facility operates seven days per week throughout the year.  \n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in each of these three systems.  Systems include the Cold Storage System, the Production System, and the Production 2013 System.  Each system is a single-stage mechanical refrigeration system.\n\nCompressors provide suction and compression for the systems to operate.  The heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporati"

The Plan includes notification and evacuation protocols.\n\nThere is an oil pot at the recirculator for the Cold Storage System and the oil pot vessel is equipped with a self-closing, spring-loaded drain valve for safety.  Oil is drained from the Production System through the plate and frame chillers, which also have self-closing, spring-loaded valves.  Oil from the Production 2013 System is drained through oil pots at the accumulator and surge drums.  All pressure vessels in the systems have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's on the Cold Storage System and Production 2013 System relieve to a respective  ammonia diffusion tank via a common discharge piping system.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain efficient refrigeration processes. The bulk Aqua Ammonia will vent to atmosphere.\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof and the evaporators are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line at the Cold Storage and Production systems.\n\nThe facility utilizes an aqueous ammonia injection process which is used to control the pH level in starter cultures for the starter room as part of the cheese making process. Aqueous ammonia is delivered by a qualified vendor in 6,000 gallon increments to an 8,400 gallon stainless-steel bulk storage tank. As needed, the aqueous ammonia is pumped from the bulk storage tank into the starter culture tanks. Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC) totes will be kept onsite as backup to be used in the event that the bulk storage tank process is non-operational.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia process at Hilmar Cheese Company consists of a stainless-steel bulk storage tank, IBC totes, pumps, starter tanks, and valves which are interconn"

      "SummaryText": "ected by piping. The three starter room injection points are connected to the bulk storage tank and are interconnected by piping. As such, the aqueous ammonia process at Hilmar Cheese Company is treated as a single process.\n\n \nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Key prevention steps taken by this facility to maintain safety are outlined in the PSM Program in the CalARP Program manual.  These steps include the description of all system and equipment information, process hazard analysis, operator training, contractor qualification, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, hot work permitting, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.\n\nThose who operate, maintain, or monitor the system will be trained to understand the principles of ammonia refrigeration and ammonia properties, an understanding of the process equipment and proper operating and maintenance procedures, recognition of abnormal conditions and the steps to correct deviations, and emergency shutdown procedures as appropriate to the level of involvement each employee will have with the process.  Contractors that perform maintenance or that design changes to the system will be qualified by the facility based upon their experience and safety record before being selected to provide such services.\n\nThe general safety program includes hazardous communication, forklift operation, first aid, emergency response, and additional programs as necessary to maintain a safe operation.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia from this facility in the last five years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmployees are trained to understand the requirements of the Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Action Plan includes rel"

The Emergency Coordinator implements the response in coordination with the local emergency responders (i.e. the fire department).  The Emergency Coordinator is also trained to the OSHA Incident Command level.  It is the policy and practice to conduct evacuation drills regularly.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPHAs have been performed for all covered processes between 2021 and 2024. The recommendations from these PHAs are being addressed and all recommendations will have documented resolutions.\n \nPlanned changes as a result of the recent PHA include:\n\n1.\tMinor improvements in the Process Safety Information and the Maintenance Program.\n2.\tRevalidation of prior seismic analyses Cold Storage and Production 2013 Systems.\n3.\tConducting Mechanical Integrity Audit (MIA) for Production and Cold Storage Systems.\n4.\tEvaluate efficiency of communication methods for those on site.\n5.\tMinor modifications to the Emergency Response Procedures."
