Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station has a plan in place to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  This investigation is lead by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process.  The findings and recommendations made by the incident investigation team are promptly addressed and resolved in a timely manner.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station is an unmanned site.  All emergency response actions are coordinated with the Caddo-Bossier Parish LEPC.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the Caspiana Compressor Station periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are to be conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.  The audit team develops findings"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the Hazard Review team.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at the facility.  The Enable Midstream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nEnable Midstream operates the Caspiana Compressor Station located in Caddo Parish, Louisiana.    The Caspiana Compressor Station is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquified petroleum gas (LPG), a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and hexanes by Joule-Thompson separation with water removal by glycol dehydration.  The LPG and condensate is transported from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Caspiana Compressor Station is a Program 2 process. \r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station has not had any accidental releases during the past five years.\r\n\r\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency p"

The Caspiana Compressor Station processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations but not OSHA's PSM standards because the plant is unmanned.  This summary describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program implemented by Enable Midstream.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe company also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  Enable Midstream utilizes standard operating manuals for pumps, controls and relief valves, API Standards for pipe, vessels, and tanks, and ANSI Standards for the ESD System.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nHazard Review and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Compressor Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associate"
