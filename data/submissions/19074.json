The prevention program covers the ClO2 generating plant, the ClO2 delivery system to the bleach plant where it first mixes with the pulp and the ClO2 gas collection system from the main collection header to the scrubber.  The plan consists of engineered systems and a management system.  Engineered systems include an air sweep process for the storage tanks, automated shut off valves, an enclosure for suction piping, safety reliefsystems on the storage tanks, generator and dump tanks, and ClO2 alarms that trigger at 0.3 ppm.  The plant has an onsite HAZMAT team and conducts annual response training exercises with the local fire and police departments as well as other responders.  The plant also maintains a Safer gas dispersion modeling  system using real time meteorological data.  The management system is based on the 14 aspects of OSHA's PSM program found in CFR 1910.119.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nS.D. Warren Company is committed to operating its integrated pulp and paper mill in Skowhegan, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and employee safety, S.D Warren has developed and implemented numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  S. D. Warren has also developed and implements a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the mill.  Many of these programs have been in place since the late 1980s. \n\nS.D. Warren believes that safety, health, and environmental protection are essential to the responsible operation of its facilities.  S.D. Warren views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a continuous process.  Consequently, S.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to S.D. Warrens overall accident prevention and response program is the development of the Somerset mills Risk Management Program.  Somersets risk management program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (\"EPAs\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA.  This document satisfies the requirement by providing the public with information about  processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts at the Somerset mill.

Implementation of an accident prevention program.  The mills RMP program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals complements the existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program which was developed in 1994 under similar rules administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \"OSHA\";\n3. Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the mill is developing a single integrated contingency plan (ICP) that is designed to meet the emergency response planning requirements under a number of applicable state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning laws.\n\nAdditional information regarding how Somerset addresses each of these requirements is summarized below and in the attached RMP.\n\nWhile the RMP program at Somerset helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of Somersets comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Maintenance of a fully equipped and trained Hazardous Materials Response Team (Hazmat Team) and Fire Brigade;\n2. Regular employee/contractor safety training;\n3. Participation with and representation on the local emergency planning committee (LEPC);\n4. Coordinated training and drills with the local fire departments;\n5. Periodic table-top and full scale safety and emergency response drills; \n6.

Forklift training.\n\nIn addition, the mill and all equipment are designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.\n\nS. D. Warrens commitment to environmental stewardship and providing a safe workplace is demonstrated in its phase-out of elemental chlorine in 1997 and aqueous ammonia at the waste treatment plant in 1998.  In 1999, the mill decreased its propane storage levels by 1/3 in two different locations.  Somerset is also integrating  all of its emergency response and accident prevention plans into a single, easy to use Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is designed to provide more-effective emergency response guidance and to comply with a number of state and federal laws.  \n\nB.  RMP Covered Process and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Somerset mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and fine coated papers.  In 1997 it replaced chlorine in its bleaching process with chlorine dioxide making the process an Elemental Chlorine Free System (ECF).  The only chemical present at the mill in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the RMP rule is chlorine dioxide used in the bleaching process (covered process).  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1% of a liquid mixture that is stored in four 110,000 gallon tanks.  These tanks are protected by a dike that is designed and capable of holding  110% of the single largest storage tank.    In addition to containing a liquid release, the dike is designed to mitigate the adverse impact of any vapor release that could potentially result from a liquid spill of the mixture by reducing the surface area of the exposed liquid.  \n\nAt a concentration of 1%, the total amount of chlorine dioxide stored on-site could be 36,684 pounds.  The amount of chlorine dioxide stored in any single vessel is normally 9,170 pounds.   \n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis is required by the RMP rul"

      "SummaryText": "e to estimate potential impacts to the community. Somersets off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release and an alternative release.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest tank is released instantaneously.  While it is virtually impossible for an entire 110,000 gallon tank to instantaneously release its contents, the chances of this occurring in Central Maine on a 960F night with the most stable atmospheric conditions and the wind blowing at 3.4 miles per hour are extremely remote.  \n\nUnder the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill for purposes of RMP would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mills fence line.  To further mitigate adverse impacts associated with this worst-case release, Somerset is building a new dike around the chlorine dioxide storage tanks that is designed to contain a liquid chlorine dioxide spill and reduce the surface area of the pool of ClO2 in the event of a spill.  The reduced dike surface area will minimize vapor released from such a spill.  The newly constructed dike would reduce the potentially impacted off-site areas by the worst case release by approximately 50%.\n\nAn alternative release focuses on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, "

Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nSomerset has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release from the covered process.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHAs Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and analogous RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  To comply with the RMP rule, the mill has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focus -- protection of the public.  \n\nThe basic elements of Somersets accident prevention program are described below: \n\n1. Employee Participation.  Somerset has developed and implements a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information at the mill.   \n\n2. Process Safety Information.  In accordance with applicable requirements, Somerset has compiled and maintains written process safety information about the design, installation, maintenance, and operation of the covered process.  This ensures that information remains current.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analyses.  Somerset performed  a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the covered process.  The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and Somersets RMP accident prevention program.  It is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential hazards posed by the covered process.  \n\nSpecifically, the PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the covered process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the ha"
