FHRA purchased this facility in April 2004 from Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. Since doing so, FHRA has gone to great efforts to further develop and prioritize health and safety performance at the facility. At FHRA, safety is a value. As such, it defines who FHRA is and what FHRA believes in. The facility has made a commitment to both employee and public safety. FHRA's vision is to be recognized as a leader for safe operations ensuring the health and safety of employees, contractors, customers, and neighbors. FHRA's first priority is prevention. This priority is demonstrated by the resources FHRA has invested in accident prevention.  These include designing and constructing equipment to meet stringent, nationally recognized standards of performance. FHRA operates and maintains equipment to ensure reliability, which also serves as a measure of how safe an operation is. FHRA trains employees to recognize the importance of safety and to incorpora"

FHRA's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n2.1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe facility previously operated a variety of processes to produce various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, asphalt, and jet fuel, from crude oil. The facility handles regulated flammables above the RMP threshold quantity but does not handle or process threshold quantities of toxic regulated substances per this regulation. As a result, no toxic chemicals are reportable for the facility RMP. On May 24, 2014, FHRA ceased crude oil processing. The Extraction Unit was shut down and de-inventory activities commenced on May 1, 2014. Crude Unit #2 was shut down and de-inventory activities commenced on May 24, 2014. The closure of these units ended production of refined products. FHRA will continue to market fuels through the North Pole Terminal. \n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\n2.1.3    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of th"

Program 3 processes at the facility that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHRA encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFHRA has available technical documents that are needed to maintain safe operation of the facility.

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  The facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition, flow, pressure).  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).  The facility also maintains other technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design temperature and pressure ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nFHRA has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined on a regular basis to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  FHRA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nIf ways are found to make processes safer, all appropriate individuals, in"

The HAZOP, What-If, and Checklist techniques are utilized during the Hazard Analysis Revalidation process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for implementation, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFHRA maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including (1) equipment startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, \n\n(5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of new equipment.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are annually reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The written procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their jobs.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHRA has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.  After operators demonstrate through tests, skills demonstration, and other methods used to determine that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has policies in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n\n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, FHRA evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFHRA conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify readiness.

This program includes: (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) regular inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that reliably maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  FHRA incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFHRA has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
