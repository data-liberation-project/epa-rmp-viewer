      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nFOR\nGENERAL AMERICAN TRANSPORTATION CORPORATION\nWAYCROSS, GEORGIA TANK CAR MAINTENANCE FACILITY\nCOVERED PROCESS: RAIL CAR CLEANING\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGATC operates a railroad tank car service center in Waycross, Georgia.  The facility is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Facility operations include painting and sandblasting, railcar interior cleaning, an organic scrubber system, an ammonia flare for venting cars containing ammonia, and a flare for venting flammable gases.  Before a tank car is cleaned, any remaining contents in the car must be removed.  These processes, specifically the venting operations, involve the use of the following regulated toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantity:\n\n7 Ammonia \t7 1,3 Butadiene\t7 Chlorine\n7 Butane\t7 Butene\t7 Isopentane\n7 1 Butene\t7 2 Butene\t7 2 Methyl 1 butene\n7 2 Butene cis\t7 2 Butene trans\t7 3 Methyl 1 butene\n7 Isobutane\t7 Isoprene\t7 2 Methylproprene\n7 Propane\t7 Propylene\t7 Nitric Acid\n7 Hydrochloric Acid\t7 Pentane\t7 1 Pentene\n7 1,3 Pentadiene\t7 2 Pentene (E)\t7 2Pentene (Z)\n7 Dimethylamine\t7 Ethlyamine\t7 Oleum\n7 Methylamine\t7 Trimethylamine\t\n\nGATC also transports in its railcar fleet other commodities which it does not process, has never processed, and does not intend to begin processing, at the facility, but which are included on the regulated toxic substances list for accidental release prevention.  GATC has established administrative controls to prevent these commodities from arriving at the facility.  Nonetheless, the regulation still requires preparation of worst case and alternate release scenarios for these commodities.  Based upon engineering judgement and process knowledge, the alternate release scenarios for these substances were assumed equal to the worst-case release scenario.  These substances are as follows:\n\n7 Bromine\t7 Carbon Disulfide\t7 Chloroform\n7 Ethyl Chloride\t7 Allyl Alcohol\t7 Formaldehyde\n7 Ethylene Oxide\t7 Methyl M"

GATC has established administrative controls to prevent cars from arriving at the Facility carrying the following commodities in excess of the TQ:\n\n7 Acetaldehyde\t7 Methyl Ether\t7 Propylene Oxide\n7 Vinyl Acetate Monomer\t7 Vinyl Chloride\t7 Ethyl Ether\n7 Acrylonitrile\t7 Epichlorohydrin\t7 Ethylenediamine\n\nIt is noted that GATC has applied for a Title V Operating Permit, but the permit number had not been issued as of this writing. \n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nGATC is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with relevant  regulations and good operating practices.  These operating practices strive to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the rail car cleaning process.  If an accidental release were to occur, GATC has response measures in place to minimize the release impact.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS \n\nThe worst-case release scenario incorporated the following:\n\n7 At the time of this writing, GATC used the latest available version of USEPA's RMP*Comp software to estimate distances to the toxic and flammable (1 psi overpressure due to an explosion) endpoints for the 59 substances listed above. \n\n7 For the worst-case release, GATC analyzed 59 regulated substances.  This release consisted of the largest quantity of a given substance released from the largest class of railcar that could potentially carry a given substance.  For example, in cases where several different size railcars could transport a given substance,"

      "SummaryText": "the release was assumed to occur from the largest single railcar that could transport that substance.  Passive mitigation measures were not included in the worst-case analysis since passive mitigation measures are not utilized at the Waycross facility.\n\nThe RMP*SUBMIT program presents one worst-case toxic release and one worst-case flammable release.  The toxic substance presented in RMP*SUBMIT is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.  USEPA's RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L.  The flammable substance presented in RMP*SUBMIT is pentane.  USEPA's RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the pentane flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  The toxic and flammable endpoints do go offsite.  These substances were presented in RMP*SUBMIT since the distance to their respective toxic and flammable endpoints is greatest.\n\nRail cars are inspected by GATC personnel for potential leaks and the rail car's  structural and operational integrity are assessed before the cleaning process begins.  A rail car can only be cleaned if it enters the facility with a very small quantity of a regulated substance since the facility is not equipped to handle large quantities of regulated substances.  Rail cars that arrive at the facility with large quantities of a regulated substance are returned to the customer.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS  \n\nThe alternate release scenario incorporated the following:\n\n7 At the time of this writing, GATC used the latest available version of USEPA's RMP*Comp software to estimate distances to the toxic and flammable (1 psi overpressure due to an explosion) endpoints for all of the toxic substances and one flammable substance that GATC processes.\n\n7 For the alternate release, twenty-nine substances were analyzed. These substances are anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, oleum, acrylonitrile, allyl alcohol, bromine, carbon disulfide, chloroform,"

No mitigation measures are in place.\n\nChlorine Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe chlorine release is a 15-minute duration release, from a ruptured hose during railcar unloading.

The hose is connected to a valve on the bottom of the railcar.  The nitric acid pool evaporates into the atmosphere.  The hose rupture diameter is assumed to be 2-inches.  The release duration is 10 minutes.  Release mitigation involves closing a hand valve upstream of the chemical pump and the tank car outlet valve.  Closing both of these valves within 5 minutes introduces a 50 percent spill mitigation control factor. \n\nHydrochloric Acid Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe hydrochloric acid release is a hose rupture during railcar unloading, thereby forming a pool.

This scenario assumes that the release occurs over a 15-minute period, and no active mitigation systems are in place.\n\nThe toxic and flammable endpoints do go offsite for the alternate release scenarios.  Active mitigation measures were considered, where applicable.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn December 1995, GATC performed a hazard and operability (HAZOP) process hazard analysis (PHA) in order to identify potential hazards at the facility.  GATC has several process controls in use such as relief valves, check valves, flares, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms, and procedures in the event of a release.  Additionally, a hose inspection and replacement policy is in place to further minimize the likelihood of a release.\n\nGATC has developed a set of operating procedures contained in the GATC Car Cleaning Procedures Manual.  The Manual documents procedures for acceptance, inspection and sampling of incoming railcars, and provides the documentation for operating the rail car cleaning system.  These procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  \n\nGATC has procedures in place to conform to requirements established by the Pro"

The GATC employee participation in this process is essential to a quality effort in eliminating potential workplace hazards and incidents.\n\nGATC has developed a training plan to attempt to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.

The Manual documents procedures for acceptance, inspection and sampling of incoming railcars, and provides the documentation for operation of the rail car cleaning system.  These procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  GATC has developed a training plan to attempt to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.  Up to date and accurate instruction and continued employee training procedures will aid in future facility safety."
