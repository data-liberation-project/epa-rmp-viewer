The facility includes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for storage of its ingredients and products. The anhydrous ammonia in Castleberry?s system is liquefied by refrigeration, and totals approximately 11,150 pounds, which exceeds the applicable threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in Table 1 to 40 CFR ?68.130. The high pressure receiver (HPR), which is the largest vessel in the process, is located within a containment area with an area of approximately 60 ft2. \n\nBecause the quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system exceeds 10,000 pounds, it is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management standard in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nCastleberry?s has developed mitigation measures to mitigate the risk in handling anhydrous ammonia. A worker safety plan has been implemented and includes training for both contractors and operations personnel. Training programs include safe operating procedures, operation and maintenance of the system, proper use of personnel protective equipment, fire safety, and emergency communication and response procedures. Plant personnel are trained in emergency procedures including plant evacuation and fire prevention. However, in the event of an emergency, plant personnel will defer to the Richmond County Emergency Response Team (ERT). In 2008, Castelberry?s intends to maintain its own on-site response team by training employees in 24-hour hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) standards. Upon the completion of the training, the Richmond County ERT can provide direction to Castleberry?s in the event of an emergency response situation when necessary. \n\nEmergency response program\n\nIn the event of a s"

Castleberry?s will take command of the situation upon arrival, mitigate the spill or release, and take appropriate actions to safeguard public health and the environment. The Richmond County ERT, which has a 6-minute response time for on-site spills or releases, may provide direction to Castleberry?s emergency response team, as necessary. \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe HPR is located within a spill containment area that directs materials to a sump within the containment area. No other chemicals are stored within the containment area.  The refrigeration system is equipped with vessel monitors and interlocks to minimize the chance of an accidental release. Only trained technicians conduct system maintenance and repairs. Castelberry?s implements the manufacturer?s recommended preventive maintenance procedures as a standard operating procedure. In addition, daily (at a minimum) routine inspections of the ammonia system process equipment are conducted.\n\nStandard operating procedures have been established for the ammonia deliveries at the site. \n\nFinally, Castleberry?s is a member of the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), which is a leading advocate for the safe, reliable and efficient use of ammonia and other natural refrigerants for industrial applications. The IIAR serves as a valuable resource for standards and training to assist Castleberry?s with maintaining its system to prevent accidental releases. Beginning in the 2nd quarter of 2008, Castleberry?s will have operators on all three shifts who are trained to Operator 3 level. The training will be provided by Garden City, which is partnered with the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).   \n\nFive-year accident history and planned"
