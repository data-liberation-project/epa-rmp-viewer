      "SummaryText": "King Soopers Bakery is a located in Denver, Colorado.  This facility manufactures and distributes bakery products to King Soopers Grocery Stores.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature for storing the product until distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of pressure vessels, evaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:   King Soopers Bakery is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and EPA's Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, there programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency action steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst care release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for the actual emergency response planning.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario selected is one in which a pipe leaks.  EPA's \"Risk Management "

      "SummaryText": "Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenarios.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The alternative release scenario must meet two criteria: 1) Must be more likely to occur that the worst case scenario and; 2) Must reach an endpoint off site, unless no such criteria exist.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  As a part of the PSM program, King Soopers Bakery has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  There programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permits\nContractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM Program, King Soopers Bakery maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to response in a defensive manner has well as request assistance as necessary by calling the local fire department and hazmat team.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  King Soopers Bakery has had an excellent record in the last five years of preventing accidental releases.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety:  King Soopers Bakery is taking a hands-on approach to enduring the safety of their employees and community.  King Soopers Bakery will operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Gui"
