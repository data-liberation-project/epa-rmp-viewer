This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n-A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n-An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n-A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n-An overview of our emergency response program\n-An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces specialty chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Plant 1 produces 400 different products by reacting and blending different chemicals in a variety of 25 different vessels to support the chemial industry.  Plant 2, the Surfactant Plant, also uses reactions and blending, utilizing four reaction vessels.  Plant 3, the Toner Binder Plant, produces resin-based products using one of two reactors.   In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nEthylene Oxide is utilized in the Surfactant Plant to make surfactants.

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n-Process Safety Information (PSI): We maintain the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and non-covered processes:\n\no Toxicity information\no Permissible exposure limits\no Physical data\no Reactivity data\no Corrosivity data\no Thermal and chemical stability data\no Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur\n\nWe use material safety data sheets (MSDS's) to provide most of the process chemical information.

Whenever required information was not available, we obtained the information from equipment vendors, process designers, plant engineering, and/or research and development departments.  In conjunction with our equipment information collection efforts, we documented that our equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  For our older processes, where design information is obsolete, our Engineering Department evaluated the existing design against appropriate safety criteria and documented that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\n-Process Hazards Analysis (PHA)- We conduct systematic PHA's of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility according to an established schedule.  This schedule ensures that we (1) address each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or offsite population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).  We also conduct PHA's of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.  \n\nOur PHA teams are composed of personnel with engin"

We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date. \n\n-Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)- Our process engineers, operators, and shift supervisors work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations including:\n\no Initial startup\no Normal operations\no Temporary operations\no Emergency shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\no Emergency operations\no Normal shutdown\no Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown\n\nOur development teams use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, and their own experience to create and validate the procedures. \n\nOur procedures address the following information:\n\no Steps for safely conducting activities \no Safe operating limits\no Consequences of process deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations\no Safety and health considerations including (1) properties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, an"

Our refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and startup following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group.  \n\nAll training is accompanied by some form of evaluation to verify that our training has been understood.

We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.  \n\nOur audit team members use a protocol or a check-sheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or noncompliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.  Plant management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved.  We retain the two most recent audit reports.\n\n-Incident Investigations - We investigate all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a large uncontrolled release of a regulated substance, serious injuries to our employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment.

New employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.  The Safety Manager audits completed Safe Work Permit Forms to ensure that any errors in preparation or approval are identified and brought to the attention of those involved to prevent recurrence.\n\n-Contractor Safety Programs - We have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process.  This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.\n\nWe select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process.  The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience).
