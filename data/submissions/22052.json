      "SummaryText": "London Water Plant\nChlorine gas can be slowed down by closing off the room were the Chlorine is in use, and we will try to divert as much of the chemical into the system if possible. This will slow down the amount of leakage into the atmosphere. Authorized personnel will attempt to shut off or repair chemical using safety equipment and repair kit.\n\nTo find a Chlorine leak, tie a rag on a stick, and dip rag into some 20 degree Baume' Ammonia and hold it near the suspected leak. White fumes will indicate the exact location of the leak.\n\nNEVER PUT WATER ON A CHLORINE LEAK. The mixture of water and Chlorine will increase the rate of corrosion of the container and make the leak larger. If Chlorine gas from a leaking container can be used in the operating system, the pressure in the container can be lowered and the leak will be less serious. If the operating system cannot use it fast enough, the Chlorine should be passed into a alkaline solution, which will absorb it. Such solutions can be made using Caustic Soda or Soda Ash mixed with water. The Chlorine should be passed into the Alkaline Solution near the bottom of the container, through iron pipe or weighted rubber hose. Either Caustic Soda or Soda Ash, along with a suitable container to hold the solution, must be kept near the Chlorine unloading areas, ready for instant use.\n\nAfter leak is controlled clean up may consist of the cleaning of all fixtures and the replacement of damaged fixtures, for corrosion control.\n\nThe London Utility Commission has the Chlorine in a enclosed room that is designed for storage and use of Chlorine.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be for both of the one ton cylinders to leak at the same time.\n\nWe received our one ton tanks of Chlorine from the P.B. & S. Chemical Company Inc.\n\nIn the last five years the London Utiltiy Commission has not had a Chlorine Leak."
