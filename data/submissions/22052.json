              "Description": "Chlorine is a poisonous gas and may be fatal if inhaled, contact may cause burns to skin and eyes. Irritant or corrosive, isolate hazard area and deny entry, stay upwind and away from low areas, authorized personnel only with proper self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing near contaminated area. If Chlorine comes in contact with eyes, immediately flush with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids. If in contact with skin, immediately flush with water for 15 minutes. If clothing is contaminated remove immediately. If ingested immediately drink large quantities of water. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If inhaled, rush to hospital immediately. IN-PLACE SHELTERING. The average rate of air change per hour in \"average\" American homes and office-type buildings under average conditions is 0.8 to 1.0 acph with doors and windows closed and ventilation systems closed down. \"Leaky\" buildings or average buildings exposed to serve weather conditions, with air change rate of 1.5 to 2.5 acph, may experience 45 to 65 percent of outdoor concentration in 30 minutes. If a structure is exposed to hazardous concentrations for and extended period of time, the chemical concentration inside the structure may approach the outside concentration. Therefore, in-place sheltering is generally applicable for releases of short duration ( 30 min. or less ) and may have limited application for releases over a period of time in excess of one hour. The local radio an television stations will be used to notify residences to stay inside and turn off all air conditioners, heat pumps, and all outside ventilation. The local law enforcement agencies, local fire departments and rescue departments will be ask to assist in notification of residences inside the affected area.TRAINING OF FACILITIES PERSONNEL. The facilities personnel are trained in the use of SCBA's, and have annual retraining in its use. They have been trained by P.B. & S Chemical Company's Safety Department in Chlorine handling and use. The London Utility Commission does annual retraining on the safety handling of Chlorine and hazardous chemicals. The employee's are trained to use 26 degree Baume' Ammonia to detect a leak. The employee's trained in the use of Caustic Soda and Soda Ash to absorb a Chlorine spill. TRAINING OF COMMUNITY RESPONSE PERSONEL. The Ambulance Inc. of Laurel Co. Emergency Management Agency are trained in Disaster Control and are on 24 hour call. Local fire departments an many other local emergency response personnel have had the Kentucky Tech ( Awareness and Operations Level Training on Hazardous Materials ). The Hazardous Incident Team and Laurel Co. Emergency Management have received the Haz-Mat Technicians Level Class.",

      "SummaryText": "London Water Plant\nChlorine gas can be slowed down by closing off the room were the Chlorine is in use, and we will try to divert as much of the chemical into the system if possible. This will slow down the amount of leakage into the atmosphere. Authorized personnel will attempt to shut off or repair chemical using safety equipment and repair kit.\n\nTo find a Chlorine leak, tie a rag on a stick, and dip rag into some 20 degree Baume' Ammonia and hold it near the suspected leak. White fumes will indicate the exact location of the leak.\n\nNEVER PUT WATER ON A CHLORINE LEAK. The mixture of water and Chlorine will increase the rate of corrosion of the container and make the leak larger. If Chlorine gas from a leaking container can be used in the operating system, the pressure in the container can be lowered and the leak will be less serious. If the operating system cannot use it fast enough, the Chlorine should be passed into a alkaline solution, which will absorb it. Such solutions can be made using Caustic Soda or Soda Ash mixed with water. The Chlorine should be passed into the Alkaline Solution near the bottom of the container, through iron pipe or weighted rubber hose. Either Caustic Soda or Soda Ash, along with a suitable container to hold the solution, must be kept near the Chlorine unloading areas, ready for instant use.\n\nAfter leak is controlled clean up may consist of the cleaning of all fixtures and the replacement of damaged fixtures, for corrosion control.\n\nThe London Utility Commission has the Chlorine in a enclosed room that is designed for storage and use of Chlorine.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be for both of the one ton cylinders to leak at the same time.\n\nWe received our one ton tanks of Chlorine from the P.B. & S. Chemical Company Inc.\n\nIn the last five years the London Utiltiy Commission has not had a Chlorine Leak."
