The facility has one 12,000-gallon aboveground storage tank onsite containing isopentane (C.A.S.# 78-78-4) which is used in the formulation of the packaging products. The tank is located inside a concrete dike with capacity to hold approximately 34,000-gallons. \n\nThe facility previously operated a total of three aboveground storage tanks, (2- 12,000-gallon and 1- 6,000-gallon capacity), prior to the decommissioning of two tanks (one 12,000-gallon and the 6,000-gallon) in 2020.  \n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRAPAC is committed to providing a safe working environment. We will achieve this mission by promoting a culture in which employee safety is paramount in each and every endeavor. We will actively promote and maintain the following beliefs in everything we do:\n\n\n\n?    Safety performance is critically important to the success of RAPAC. \n\n?    Concern for employee safety will be evident and embedded into all phases of our work by design and through the business decisions that we make. \n\n?    Each employee is empowered with responsibility for his or her personal safety and the safety of their fellow employees and stakeholders. \n\n?    Continuous improvement is a way of life at RAPAC; we use feedback and experience to refine and build upon our culture to ensure continual forward progress. \n\n?    Safety incidents are preventable; we will strive to ensure that our policies, practices, and decisions are proactive on all accounts.\n\n?    Management is responsible for ensuring employees have the knowledge, skills, and equipment necessary to protect themselves and others. \n\n?    We will not be satisfied to simply meet safety compliance standards. \n\n?    Every task must be"
