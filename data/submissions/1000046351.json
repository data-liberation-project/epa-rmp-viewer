The Plant is manned on the day shift and the process is monitored 24-hours per day, 7-days per week, 365-days per year at the District Headquarters located in Coachella.\r\n\r\nMaximum Inventory of Regulated Substances\r\nThe District's Maximum Inventory of Chlorine is 4,000-pounds (i.e., two one ton containers of chlorine).\r\n\r\nSite Security\r\nIn order to ensure the security of the site, the District has erected a chain link fence around the entire site. Additionally, the site is equipped with a perimeter security system. Lastly, ALL building entries are equipped with intruder alarms to alert Control of unauthorized access. These site security provisions are intended to\r\nprevent unauthorized access to areas of the Plant where chlorine is stored, handled or used and seek to provide an added level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the Plant.\r\n\r\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations: the worst case release; and an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario). A number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal\r\nRMP/CalARP RMP Update. These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\r\n\r\nCHLORINE\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Chlorine. In this scenario, one of the one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an\r\nunknown event. This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine storage enclosure or area where the one ton container"

However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded. This scenario is\r\nconsidered to be extremely unlikely. In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case). The release of chlorine would occur outdoors. It was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of chlorine vapor which is then free to migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 3.0 -miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios for Chlorine\r\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 2000 -pounds of chlorine. These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Plant, a pinhole leak in the chlorine\r\ntransfer piping, a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (100-percent vapor) at various points in the system (out-doors or in-doors), the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the online one-ton container, or a leak from the valve assembly of the one ton container. In order to be conservative in the\r\nestimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 1447-pounds of chlorine was released (over a 60-minute period) during an accident involving the valve assembly on an online one ton container. The resulting cloud of chlorine vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 0.2 miles.\r\n\r\nES 3.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Five Year Federal RMP"

These devices are located throughout the Plant and monitor various aspects of Plant Operations.\r\n\r\nAlarms\r\nWRP No. 9 is equipped with Leak Detectors that are designed to detect chlorine in the chlorine storage and use areas at or above 1-ppm. When one of these detectors senses a gas leak at or above 1.0-ppm, audible alarms activate locally and an alarm is transmitted to District Control at Headquarters. At 3-ppm the visual alarm\r\n(beacon light) on top of the building is activated. Ventilation fans in the chlorinator room run constantly 24-hours per day. The alarms can only be reset and cleared after the leak detectors sense less than 1-ppm of gas. The alarms are tested by District Operators twice each month. Additionally, the District's Communications Shop inspects, tests and calibrates the chlorine alarm system on a monthly schedule.\r\n\r\nES 5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nThe Coachella Valley Water District recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.

The Chlorine Response Team can be dispatched to the Plant during the staffed hours if the Plant Staff are unable to respond to the leak with a three person crew.When control receives a gas leak alarm after hours, the Control Operator will call out the Chlorine Response Team and the Sanitation Standby Operator. Upon arrival at the scene, both will wait at the entrance gate for the other to arrive and will enter the Plant together.\r\n\r\nResponse Teams\r\nEmergency response and any work with chlorine connections requires a minimum of three employees to be present. ALL Plant Operators are trained in Emergency Response. The crew of employees trained in response to chlorine leaks at the District's domestic well sites have been trained to respond to chlorine leaks at WRP No.9 as well. After hours this two-person crew responds with the standby operator to unmanned Plants or to other Plants that may need assistance. There are always three employees on call with pagers ready to respond to chlorine emergencies. The on call crew is rotated weekly.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nChlorine response personnel are scheduled to be trained quarterly in the use of emergency repair kits, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and District Emergency Response Procedures. Furthermore, chlorine emergency response personnel are trained annually in the safe storage and handling of chlorine and in CPR/First Aid.
