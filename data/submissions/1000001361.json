      "SummaryText": "ANDERSON ERICKSON DAIRY CO.\nDES MOINES, IOWA\n\nBackground Data\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Anderson Erickson Dairy Co. (AE Dairy) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Des Moines, Iowa facility.  The operations at AE Dairy include the processing of fluid milk and dairy products for public consumption, packaged under the familiar Anderson Erickson Dairy brand name.  AE Dairy has been in operation at this facility for over 60 years providing quality products and over 300 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nAE Dairy is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is AE Dairy's policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of AE Dairy's final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  These requirements are promulgated and monitored by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Iowa State Department of Agriculture and the Iowa State Department of Health.  In addition, the refrigeration system is utilized to operate large coolers for product storage.  To achieve this, AE Dairy uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112A? regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.  The ammonia refrigeration system maintains the 157,000 sq. ft. facility within the required range of operating temperatures and provides the cooling for all stored products. Anhydrous ammonia is a standard refrigerant for the food industries and widely used througho"

The refrigeration system at AE Dairy consists of receiver vessels, compressors, evaporators, condensers, chillers and piping.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, AE Dairy has implemented several precautionary measures including process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive-maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system itself is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems. \n\nAE Dairy has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the refrigeration system for the potential to release anhydrous ammonia.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia include process equipment (pressure relief valves, check valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs), automated controls (automatic shutoffs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding) and emergency power supply. \n\nAE Dairy has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases.  The procedures were developed by a team consisting of personnel from operations and maintenance, plant engineering, and AE Dairy's refrigeration contractor.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by AE Dairy, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nAE Dairy understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore AE Dairy has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is sche"

Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, equipment inspections are performed.\n\nTo ensure that the control measures at AE Dairy are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\nA? In accordance with the PSM program, AE Dairy conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up safety review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nA? In addition, the facilities and records of AE Dairy are inspected and audited by the following:\n\nA? The Iowa State Department of Agriculture every three months.\n\nA? The Iowa State Department of Health every year.\n\nA? The City of Des Moines Fire Department every year.\n \nA? The United States Food and Drug Administration every two years.\n \nA? AE Dairy's insurance carrier also conducts independent loss prevention audits every year.\n \n \nFive-Year Accident History\n \nOver the last five years, AE Dairy has had two minor incidents that did not trigger the incident investigation procedures.  Both events involved small amounts of ammonia through pin holes in a cooling plate and one at a nipple joint.  There were no injuries, hospitalizations, or property damage during either event.  AE Dairy personnel responded to both events immediately and took the appropriate actions to address and stop the releases.  Since 2007, when the last event happened, there have been no further incidents at AE Dairy.\n \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nThe AE Dairy facilities are included in the written community emergency respon"

In addition, AE Dairy has developed an emergency action program designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of an ammonia release, fire, or other emergency.  This program is fully described in a document entitled, \"ANDERSON ERICKSON DAIRY - EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\".  Included in the document are measures to be taken by AE Dairy including emergency notifications, on-site and off-site coordination, ammonia release procedures and evacuation procedures. \n \nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with AE Dairy's emergency response procedures, copies of the program have been submitted to the following local agencies: \n \nA? City of Des Moines Fire Department\n \nA? Polk County Local Emergency Planning Commission\n \nIn addition to the above local response agencies, AE Dairy has arranged for emergency response assistance with a local refrigeration contractor knowledgeable in the facility layout and the design and operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n \nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n\nA? Police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems, \n \nA? Door-to-door notification of residents, and\n\nA? Broadcast message via the Polk County Emergency Broadcast System, if necessary.\n\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n\nAE Dairy is continually upgrading their ammonia refrigeration system, training their employees on the operation and hazards of the system, and has implemented a mechanical integrity program.  This has directly resulted in improving the overall safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Most recently, AE Dairy installed an updated logic control program. Removed and replaced old equipment and piping with new state-of-the-art equipment.  All pressure relief valves were changed out in 2008."
