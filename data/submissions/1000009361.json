There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Tolleson Fire Department in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Tolleson Fire Department, relaying information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant entrance, awaiting the arrival of the fire department to inform its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.  \n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Tolleson WWTP uses chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater.  The plant routinely has up to six full and three empty one ton containers of chlorine onsite.  This is above the threshold limit (2,500 pounds) set by the USEPA. \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Tolleson WWTP receives raw wastewater from a variety of residential and commercial users within the City of Tolleson and Sun City.  The wastewater is treated through a conventional treatment process and then disinfected with chlorine.  Plant solids removed in the treatment process are anaerobically digested, producing as a byproduct, methane gas.  Chlorine gas is delivered to the site in multiple one ton pressurized containers.  The chlorine is then removed through a vacuum system, pulling the chlorine gas from the cylinders through the chlorine feeders that regulate the flow to the proportion of wastewater being treated. \nrelease scenario.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PRECAUTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Tolleson WWTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment utilizing only"

Tolleson WWTP management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Tolleson WWTP's accident history was reviewed for a period from July, 2004, through July, 2010.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program involving immediate plant evacuation once the City's Fire Department is called to implement response and repair to leaking chlorine gas.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least every two hours.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the Fire Department is trained to respond to this situation. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant evacuation plan, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency responder's plan for handling such an emergency. \n\nThe Tolleson Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment, and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant's emergency call. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for chlorine, a list of action items was developed and is being considered by Tolleson WWTP management to determine if implementation is to be accomplished.  The most notable planned changes include the following:   \n\n      \n      \u00c2\u00b7 In the future when the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded, consideration should be given to design and construction of a containment building to encompass the chlorine storage tanks designed in conjunction with the capability to chemically         neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe AccidentalRelease Prevbention Risk Management Program Rule  (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of \nhazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances--77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flamable gases--and the accidental release of these substances.  The United States Enviromental\nProtection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and\nwholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems,\nand federal facilities.\n\nThe Tolleson Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Additionally, in light of potential hazards, the City of Tolleson has completed a risk management plan for its onsite use of methane generated as a natural process in the biodegradation of wastewater treatment solids.  The Tolleson WWTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) Plan that contains the following required Information:\n\n      .  Management System\n\n      .  A hazard assesssment that establishes the worst-case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population\n         and the enviroment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B).\n\n      .  A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training,maintenance,\n         compliance audits, and incident investigations.
