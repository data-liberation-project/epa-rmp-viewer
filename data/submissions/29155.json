Landmark Services Cooperative's policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulation in order to:\n1. Prevent unnecessary human exposure,\n2. Reduce the threat to employees health, and \n3. To reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\nSafety depends upon the manner in which an accidental release is handled, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used and the training of personnel.\n\nLandmark Services Cooperative complies with the provision of Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Landmark Services Cooperative's emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, the LEPC and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers and other customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck, and is stored in 26,000 and 30,000-gallon tanks, and one 18,000-gallon tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is distributed and used for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizer for crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 309,000 pounds (78,000 gallons in 3 tanks times 4.67 pounds/gallon times 85%).\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nWorst case scenario - Failure"

The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas over a 10-minute period (11,908 pounds per minute).  The distance to the endpoint under urban conditions using RMP-Comp (toxic endpoint is 200 ppm) is 3.6 miles.\n\nAlternate Scenario - A hose breaks resulting in a release of 5% of the tank or 6000 pounds.  The release is stopped through human intervention in 2 minutes (3,000 lbs/min).
