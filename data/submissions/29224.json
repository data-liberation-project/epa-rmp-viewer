      "SummaryText": "A. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nInter-Pac Incorporated is a specialty foam manufacturing facility, which produces expandable polystyrene (EPS) beads, polyethylene (PE) foam, and structual polystyrene (SPS) foam.  The PE foam manfucturing process also includes a laminated PE foam process. \n\nExpandable polystyrene bead or \"EPS\"  beads are a plastic product that can be produced in several shapes, sizes, and colors to be used by various processors worldwide.  They are primarily used for beanbag fill and loose-fill packaging.  The process involves mixing resin with reclaimed product additives; extrusion of  the mixed resin; addition of a liquid blowing agent (pentane); cooling the material; and forcing it through a profile die.  The 6,000 gallon pentane tank is stored at the tank storage area.\n\nPolyethylene foam or \"PE\" foam is a plastic product made of polyethylene resin that can be produced in various thicknesses and colors and rolled to different lengths.  This process involves mixing resin with reclaimed product and additives, extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized plastic extruder; adding a liquid blowing agent (isobutane); then cooling the material and forcing it through a die.  The isobutane is stored at the tank storage area in  6,000 gallon and 7,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Inter-Pac\n\nInter-Pac is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of Isobutane and Pentane is documented in the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\nC.

      "SummaryText": "d to perform the following off-site consequence analyses.\n*  One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated flammable substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst case scenario was conducted for Isobutane.\n*  One alternative release scenario for regulated flammable substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A alternative release scenario was conduted for Isobutane.\n\nInter-Pac used the RMPComp program to establish the worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  More detailed information is found in  the RMPlan.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined by a major release of Isobutane (because Isobutane is the greatest quanity of flammable substance stored at the facility).  A major release from both tanks would be 55,692.  A release of this nature is highly unlikely due to to the storage location and tank design.  The results are presented in Section 4 of the RMPlan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario was based on a leak involving Isobutane.  It was determined that the an approximate release of one (1) pound per minute, for eighteen hours, was most probable.  This would lead to a release of approximately 1,080 punds of isobutane.\n\n\nD.  Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage off-site, or known off-site deaths; injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five (5) years, Inter-Pac has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\n\nE.  Management System\n\nInter-Pac has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to qualified individuals or positions of responsibility.  It clearly delineates and delegates responsibilities .\n\nF.  Preve"

      "SummaryText": "ntion Program Elements\n\nThe Prevention Program Elements include facility and safety information.  Training plays a valuable part in prevention of accidents/incidents.  Training for Inter-Pac can be found in  the RMProgram Manual. New employees working with a covered process receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR 68.54.  The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and the emergency action plan.  Refresher training is provided at a minimum every year to all employees involved in working with a covered process.  Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he/she received and understood the required training.\n\nCompliance Safety Audits - RMP compliance is confirmed through an Annual RMP audit that is performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.58.  The audits are completed by at least one person knowledgeable in process.  A report of the findings is generated following the audit, and all deficiencies and/or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented.  The two most recent safety audit reports are maintained at the facility.\n\nIncident Investigation - Specific incident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.60 in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Under EPA RMP, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion involving one or more regulated substances that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\nThe incident investigation procedures is initiated as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours following the incident.  A team is established to perform the incident investigation and always includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process, a "

When completed, all affected personnel including contract employees review the report.  Incident investigation reports are maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\n\nG. Emergency Response Plan\n\nInter-Pac is currently developing an Emergency Response Program that includes an emergency response plan addressing all RMP regulated substances present at the facility.  The emergency response plan shall include:  \n*Procedures for informing the Lee County LEPC and the community about any accidental releases;\n*Documentation of first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposure; and\n*Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\nThe emergency management plan will be reviewed annually to reflect changes at the facility and ensure that employees are informed of the changes.  Employees shall be trained initially and periodically on emergency response procedures."
