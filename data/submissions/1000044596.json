The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nClear Creek CSD provides water supply and distribution to portions of Shasta County south of the City of Redding.  Its water treatment facility, Clear Creek CSD Water Treatment Plant, is located at Paige Bar Rd., 1 mile below Whiskeytown Dam, Redding, CA in Shasta County, and uses chlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located at the base of Clair A. Hill Dam forming Whiskeytown Reservoir, in Whiskeytown - Shasta - Trinity National Recreation Area.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site on a regular schedule and also respond to alarm conditions. Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton"

      "SummaryText": " container scales inside the building.  The chlorine is used to disinfect the treated water.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Clear Creek CSD that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Clear Creek CSD has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Clear Creek CSD are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. Clear Creek CSD has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Clear Creek CSD's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Progr"

These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nClear Creek CSD's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Shasta County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  Clear Creek CSD is a non-responding facility per 29CFR 1910.38 and GISO 3220.  Potential response has been coordinated with the Shasta Cascade Hazardous Materials Response Team (SCHMRT) which is the responding agency.  Clear Creek CSD's response consists of notification of SCHMRT and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas upwind of the released gas. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Clear Creek CSD committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\n"
