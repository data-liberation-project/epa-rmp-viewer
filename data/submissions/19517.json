If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department , and other authorities , to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n2. Facility information. Trotter Fertilizer is a small independent retail facility for plant food and crop protection chemicals. anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distriuted for dierct application as fertilizer for crop production. \n3. The worst-case release and alternative release scenarios. \n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 3 miles.\n    b.The alternative release scenario would be the break of a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint would be .3 miles\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program. This facility has implemented the provisions of OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, Hazard communication. \n5. Five-year Accident Histiory. There have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years. \n6. Emergency Response Program. The Emergency Action Plan of Ashton Feed and Grain describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and to the enviromnent from sudden releases and non-sudden releases of chemicals. Copies of the well organized easy to use color codes plan have been distributed to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Fire Department, and two strategic locations at the facility. Our employees are aware of the provisions of the emergency action plan and each one's role in carring out the plan. An ongoing safety training and accident prevention program is our first line of defense.\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety. Safety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.
