The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of White Cloud Grain Co., Inc.\n(Hiawatha) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous\nammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with\nthe local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the\nimpact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for\nsale to farmer.\n\n     - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct\napplication and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n     - The maximum quantity stored would be 51,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon\nstorage tank.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents\nof a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released\nwould be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at\n85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.01 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or\nthe most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The\ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .6 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of\nanhydrous a"

      "FacilityID": 20121,
      "SummaryText": "mmonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past          \n             five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the \n       facility; nor\n\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, \n       sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\n     - The facility has:\n\n     a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, \n          29 CFR 1910.38\n\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community \n          Right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard,\n          29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations\n          are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no \n     additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for \n     implementation at this time."
