      "SummaryText": "The Anthony Ragnone Treatment Plant (ARTP) in Montrose MI is subject to section 112 of the Clean Air Act due to the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide for wastewater disinfection.  The Genesee County Division of Water & Waste, who owns and operates the facility, constructed a new disinfection facility at ARTP in 2003.  The new facility was constructed to incorporate the latest technology in safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and to accommodate disinfection demands projected for future use.  While the process methodology remains largely the same, sulfur dioxide evaporators were incorporated to increase chlorine removal process efficiency and to minimize the number of tanks required to be \"in-service\" simultaneously.  Other important features incorporated to increase safety in handling of these substances include: 1) Fully enclosed chlorine container storage and handling room.  2) Chlorine scrubber, capacity 2600lbs.  3) Sulfur dioxide scrubber, capacity 2600lbs. 4) Isolated observation corridor for each process room in the facility.   The new facility also incorporates all the significant safety features utilized in the former facility:  1) Isolated storage, evaporator, and chlorinator/sulfonator rooms.  The rooms are equipped with independent monitoring, alarms, automated or manual operation scrubber evacuation systems.  2) All cylinders are equipped with automatic shut off valve systems activated by pressure loss or power failure (fail-closed feature).  All safety systems read at the DCU in the plant control room.  Only one container is \"in-service\" for both disinfection and dechlorination systems at a time.  The ability to draw gas from the ton containers was added for both chemicals to accommodate servicing and maintenance of the liquid feed process equipment.  There have been no reportable accidents from either system in the last 5 years.  Security has also been enhanced with card reader access to all entries to the facility and 24/7 survei"

      "SummaryText": "llance operations.  A fixed surveillance camera was upgraded to a pan-tilt-zoom model to improve surveillance of the building.  Worst-case release scenario using the EPA's RMP submit program were less severe than the previous facility scenario due to the complete enclosure of the chlorine cylinder storage and handling area as well as the reduction of \"in service\" tanks on the sulfur dioxide system.  LandView6 was used to calculate affected population data, which decreased in all release scenarios.  The scrubber capabilities were not considered in the release scenarios.    The scrubbers are designed to neutralize 30% more chemical than is ever in use at one time for either disinfection or the dechlorination systems.  The general accidental release program incorporates the safety features, process safety management, training and management of change policies to prevent the incidents of accidental release. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP)was developed with the inclusion of and incorporated resources from the ARTP, the local fire and police departments, the Genesee County HAZMAT Team, the Genesee County Sheriffs Department, the Genesee County Health Department and the LEPC.  All resources recently met on 12/18/08 to conduct a tabletop exercise of the ERP."
