Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of the High Pressure Receiver.\nA maximum release of 15,188 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered.\nUnder worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to 1.1 miles before dispersing.\n\n     A WORST CASE release is very, very, very, unlikely to occur during the life of the facility, this is\nbecause  of the release prevention and mitigation features incorporated in the Associated Food Stores Inc. PSM/RMP Program and the well developed and tested designs for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\n     An alternative case release scenario that we call WORST CASE CREDIBLE was slightly more likely.\nA 3000 pound ammonia vapor loss from failure of a psv to reseat or from ruptured vapor piping. \nUnsder worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .1 mile before dispersing.\nThis release is very, very unlikely to occur during the life of the Associated Food Stores Inc facility.\n\n     An alternative case release that we call MOST LIKELY, MOST SEVERE was slightly more likely still.\nA 100 pound ammonia loss from a failing ammonia transfer hose during the unloading operation.\nUnder worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .1 mile before dispersing\nThis release is very unlikely to occur during the life of the Associated Food Stores Inc. facility.\n\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSOCIATED FOOD STORES INC..ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n      Associated Food Stores Inc. conducts an annual training and response exercise with the Weber Fire District to practice, train and update the Associated Food Stores Inc. Emergency Response Program.\n\n      Associated Food Stores Inc. conducts an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit o"

Associated Food Stores Inc. considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Associated Food Stores Inc. emphasizes and insists on  employee participation from the refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Associated Food Stores Inc. provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with one-on-one teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia refrigeration employee.\n\n     Associated Food Stores Inc. maintains a pro-active open-door policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Weber Fire District.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Associated Food Stores Inc. recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of living documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before Safety becomes becomes second nature.\n\n      Associated Food Stores Inc. expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing  the following elements of their PSM/RMP"

Operating level employees, particularly the Maintenance and Refrigeration Manager and the Refrigeration System Operators, have been deeplly involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Farr West, Utah facility safely.\n\n     Associated Food Stores Inc.
