      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSouth Orange County Wastewater Authority (SOCWA) has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSOCWA maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Joint Regional Plant of the South Orange County Wastewater Authority (SOCWA)  is located at 29201 La Paz Road in Laguna Niguel.  The facility is situated west of the La Paz Road near Kings Road and approximately 2.75 kilometers (1.71miles) west of Interstate 5.  The immediate area is primarily residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the Joint Regional Plant is used for the treatment of wastewater.  The Joint Regional Plant uses chlorine for odor control, filamentous control, or disinfection at different processes in the wastewater treatment:  1) return activated sludge (RAS), 2) plant process water, and 3) recycled water.  Chlorine is stored at the Joint Regional Plant as a liquid form of liquefied compressed gas in one ton containers.  Liquid chlorine is transferred from the one ton containers to evaporators.  The evaporators heat the liquid chlorine to produce chlorine vapor.  The chlorinators then con"

The injectors combine chlorine and water to produce chlorine solution providing an effective treatment.\n\n\n\nA maximum of 19 one ton chlorine containers (38,000 lbs) is maintained in the chlorine room of the chlorine building.  This building is located on the north side of the property.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the Joint Regional Plant has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the SOCWA treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the Joint Regional Plant fail and cause a release of chlorine, there are several mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact:  1) chlorine sensors / detectors, 2) alarms, 3) emergency vapor scrubber system, and 4) automatic / manual shut off valve on each container.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms are located in the chlorinator room and the chlorine storage room.  Once the sensors detect a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm, the emergency vapor scrubber system is activated.  The chlorine scrubber system then will absorb and eliminate chlorine vapor.  The pneumatic shut off valve on each one-ton container will automatically be closed by the chlorine detection system.  A red beacon/strobe light is located outside the door and is actuated by the chlorine sensor (1 ppm). In addition, the emergency manual pull station is tied into the detector system.  If pulled, the pneumatic valves close, the scrubber is activated and the alarm is initiated.  When the alarm sounds, the office alarms and the emergency auto dialer begins and l"

      "SummaryText": "ights on the chlorine building turn on.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber system at the Joint Regional Plant was designed and built by RJ Environmental Incorporated.  The scrubber system consists three stage chemical absorption system:  one horizontal crossflow spray scrubber followed by two horizontal crossflow packed bed sections.  The released chlorine gas is absorbed and reacted with caustic solution. The system is designed with the ventilation rate of 3000 acfm and the maximum discharge chlorine concentration of 5 ppm.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study conducted on September 16, 2013, revealed that in the last five years (September 2008 - September 2013), there have been no releases of chlorine that meet specific RMP criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such \"RMP accidents\" would involve serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  In addition, there have been no significant releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds.  The facility has had a minor incident that resulted in an incident investigation, and it is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nMarch 5, 2009\n\nThe pressure relief valve on the vacuum regulator failed open in the chlorinator room.  This allowed chlorine gas into the vent pipe which set off the chlorine leak alarm.  Facility personnel responded and were able to stop the leak.  As a result of the incident investigation, the replacement cycle on the pressure relief valve was changed to an annual basis.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSOCWA has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "The Plan includes the Emergency training for all SOCWA employees. The SOCWA performs periodic emergency evacuation drills every 90 days to enhance the emergency response skills of its personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by SOCWA Joint Regional Plant responsible person at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\n\nSOCWA has coordinated emergency response efforts withe the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, its is the policy of SOCWA to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe 2013 PHA Revalidation consisted of:\n\n\n\n1) a detailed review of the HAZOP log tables from the previous study;\n\n2) a series of safety checklists (including external events);\n\n3) a hazard and operability study; and\n\n4) a facility inspection.\n\n\n\nAll recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are complete.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the previous Seismic Assessment studies were revalidated in 2013.  The Seismic Assessment Revalidation concluded that the Chlorine Process at the Joint Regional Plant meet the structural requirements of the CalARP regulation."
