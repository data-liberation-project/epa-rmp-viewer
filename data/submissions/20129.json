These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by onsite personnel, registered engineers, and certified refrigeration contractors as required.\n\nInitial emergency response is provided by onsite personnel.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release.  Emergency response for a major release event will be provided by local fire and police departments with mutual aide response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nAll ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations personnel are required to be trained and become familiar with the company' Safety and Operations Procedures and Emergency Response Plan.  Maintenance and operations personnel will also be required to become familiar with the RMP.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Growers Ice Company facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the produce and cold storage operations.\n\nProduce is brought to the facility where it is pre-cooled and stored for processing and shipment.  Produce includes a variety of lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, strawberries, and salad products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooling system.  Following on-site pre-cooling, cooled products are stored in a number of different cold storage"

The cold room/dock system, which consists of 18 cold rooms, 3 refrigerated shipping docks, 2 refrigerated ice storage rooms and 7 pressure cooler rooms provide for general cold storage and pre-cooling of produce.\n\nIn addition to the cold rooms, docks and pressure cooler rooms there are 2 permanent Vacuum cooler tubes, 2 Hydro-cooler units and 4 Block Ice manufacturing tanks.  There can be as many as 7 portable Ice Generators connected to the refrigeration system, as many as 6 portable Hydro-vac units, and as many as 4 self-contained Ice Generator trailers on site during the months of April through November.\n\nA permanent compressor room provides refrigeration, with 10 compressors with 10 condenser units and 2 on-line liquid receivers and 1 off line receiver.  The engine room is supplemented by as many as 3 portable high-side (compressor/condenser) trailers that can be connected to the refrigeration system.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed.  The release parameters are in section 2.  The worst case scenario had a toxic endpoint at 18,600 ft.  The residential population affected by this worse case release is estimated to be 21,507.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios were evaluated using the methodologies recommended in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as prepared by the EPA.  As a part of this guidance a Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration was prepared to identify specific release scenarios for ammonia based refrigeration systems.  The atmospheric conditions used are as specified in the regulations and the guide.\n\nThe Worst Case Release considers the complete release of the maximum charge in any individual system within a 10-minute period.  The High Pressure Receiver has the largest quantity of ammonia and is considered for this scenario.  It contains a potential maximum liquid quantity of 20,000 g"

This system is considered the Worst Case scenario.\n\n The alternate release considers the release of low-pressure liquid ammonia from a flange or connection leak on the rooftop piping system.  No mitigation measures are considered for each release.  Administrative controls limit the maximum amount of refrigerant in each system.\n\nThe results of the Worst case and alternate case scenarios are presented in section 3.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs described above, the program consists of a pre-startup inspection, emergency response, and regular training.  A thorough review of the system including a Hazop analysis was performed prior to startup for 1999 season.  Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for off-site releases.  Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted on a yearly basis and will include equipment operational procedures, emergency response procedures, review of Business Response Procedures, and evacuation procedures.  Those items requiring further review, correction, and/or updating are listed in the RMP- Correction Items.\nRefrigeration equipment will be reviewed as required.  Updates when changes to equipment occur or when new equipment is brought on-site.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating to the release of ammonia refrigerant have occurred at the facility in the last five years.\n\nEMMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the State and County mandated emergency response plan (a.k.a. Business Response Plan).  This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release as well as general facility response.\n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nSafety improvements have been identified during the preparation of this program.  These improvements have been documented and a schedule developed for their implementation.  Some of the improvements include installa"
