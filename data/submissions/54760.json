      "SummaryText": "Nevada Power Company d/b/a NV Energy owns and operates the Silverhawk Generating Station (Silverhawk), a nominal 520-megawatt power plant located in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The facility uses aqueous ammonia solution (29 percent by weight) in the selective catalytic reduction process for controlling the nitrogen oxides emissions.\n\nThe scope of this RMP is based on the 40 CFR Part 68 and other published guidelines by U.S.EPA.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling system is the only process at Silverhawk that triggers the RMP requirements. This process was determined to be covered by federal RMP Program Level 1 requirements.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facility is comprised of a single storage tank, pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer where the aqueous ammonia is atomized to concentrations below 20 percent. The tank is 30,000 gallons in volume and is equipped with pressure relief valves, temperature, pressure, and level indicators. The facility has an administrative storage limit of 85% of the maximum storage capacity.  The tank is also surrounded by a dike for containing the entire contents of the storage tank in case of equipment failure.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis was conducted using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (March 2009). The worst-case release scenario was developed assuming that the entire contents of the aqueous ammonia storage tank are released through a failed tank or pipe into the secondary containment dike that is large enough to contain the entire volume. Under worst-case meteorological conditions, 1.5 m/s wind speed and a stable (Pasquill F) atmospheric stability class, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\nSummary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facili"
