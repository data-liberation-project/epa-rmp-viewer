We are strongly committed to safety by maintaining comprehensive maintenance, prevention, and industrial safety programs that protect against any accidental release or spill which may result in on- or off-site consequences.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a mishap, an emergency response plan has been developed in cooperation with the Berkeley County Disaster Preparedness Agency, which serves to ensure the safety and well being of the community and the environment.  Our emergency response program is based upon the recommendations by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. within the \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"       \n\nFacility Description\n\nChlorine is stored on-site for use in the disinfection process for the treatment of wastewater prior to final discharge.  Six 2,000-pound pressurized chlorine cylinders are located within an enclosed building south of the treatment ponds for use in the treatment process.  An additional six to eight 150-pound chlorine cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment failure.            \n\nWithin the dechlorination process, four 2000-pound storage cylinders supply gaseous sulfur dioxide, that when mixed with the treated wastewater, facilitates the removal of any residual chlorine following the chlorination process. An additional six to eight 150-pound cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explo"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred or were identified within the time period in question.  Since the facility has been in operation, no deaths or injuries have resulted from the accidental release, explosion, or fire involving this regulated substance.  Furthermore, no fish kills or other environmental impacts have resulted from an accident or spill incident at the Goose Creek, South Carolina facility.    \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Berkeley County has calculated a worst-case release scenario based on the EPA approved RMP*Comp modeling software.  An altternative release scenario has been modeled using EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  Details for each chosen scenario have been provided in the following paragraphs.\n \nChlorine\nThe worst-case release scenario, as developed for the chlorination system, involves a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single chlorine cylinder within the chlorine building.  It has been assumed that the entire quantity of chlorine is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a result of a tank rupture.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 3.0 miles corresponds to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.  Industrial facilities, a U.S. Naval Weapons Station, military barracks, residential subdivisions, creeks, rivers, and the Berkeley Reservation would be affected by such a release.    \n\nAn alternative scenario may include the catastrophic release of chlorine gas during 3 m/s windspeeds, D Class atmospheric stability, and 77 degrees fahrenheit weather conditions.  It has been assumed that a quantity of chlorine gas is released at a rate of 41.2 pounds per minute from the storage cylinders as a result of a pipe rupture within the chlorination buil"

Under the alternative weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles corresponds to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l. Industrial facilities, a U.S. Naval Weapons Station, military barracks, and housing subdivisions would be affected by such a release. Environmental receptors exposed to chlorine concentrations  above the 0.0087 mg/l level include creeks, rivers, and the Berkeley Reservation.  \n\nSulfur Dioxide\nThe worst-case release scenario, as developed for the dechlorination system, involves a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide within the dechlorinination building.  It has been assumed that the entire quantity of sulfur dioxide is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a vapor cloud resulting from the rupturing of tanks.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 3.1 miles corresponds to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. Within this 3.1 mile radius, numerous public and environmental receptors including affected industrial facilities, a U.S. Naval Weapons Station, military barracks, residential subdivisions, creeks, rivers, and the Berkeley Reservation would be affected.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario has been modeled as the catastrophic release of sulfur dioxide gas during 3 m/s windspeeds, D Class atmospheric stability, and  77degrees fahrenheit  weather conditions.  It has been assumed that a quantity of sulfur dioxide gas is released at a rate of 31.3 lbs./min from the storage cylinders as a result of a pipe rupture within the dechlorination building.  Under the Alternative weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles corresponds to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l.

The chlorination and dechlorination processes have been designed and constructed in accordance with The Chlorine Institute Standards, good engineering practices, and all applicable codes or standards.  Furthermore, the Prevention Program at the Lower Berkeley WWTP has been developed in accordance with the standards established with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The prevention program consists of the elements as follows:\n\n1. Employee Participation\nEmployees at the Lower Berkeley WWTP are provided access to all elements of this Risk Management Plan for review and input.  Site management, whenever possible, involves employees in the development, revisions, review, and implementation of this plan.  Employees, knowledgeable in the specified processes, are included in any task group or team for their invaluable experience and input for developing a successful program to ensure the well being of co-workers, the community, and the environment.\n    \n2. Process Safety Information\nThe Lower Berkeley WWTP maintains a detailed written record of all safety information regarding the operation of each covered process.  Information includes the chemical hazards, operating procedures, and equipment design parameters.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\nThe checklist hazard analysis method is utilized at the Goose Creek, South Carolina facility to identify and prevent any activity that may result in a release of a regulated substance.  A team of qualified personnel perform periodic reviews of operating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify potential hazards every three years, or in the event of any process or equipment change.
