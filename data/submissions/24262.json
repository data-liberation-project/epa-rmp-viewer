If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to to mitigate any release to the population and environment of our community.\n\n2.  a.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers to farmers  in our area.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia  that would be stored at the location is approximately 420,300 pounds, which includes or main storage tanks, nurse tanks, and a railcar.  \n \nb.  This RMP facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  During periods of non operation of this anhydrous ammonia facility local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections a various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release  of anhydrous ammonia from a railcar.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately  4.4 miles.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoing would be approximately  0.4 mile.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" \n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have"

Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n9.
