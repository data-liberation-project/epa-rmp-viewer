      "SummaryText": "DuPont Performance Polymers (DPP)- Chambers Works is a global supplier of specialty elastomers.  DPP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc.  DPP offers a wide variety of specialty elastomers with end-use applications in automotive systems, wire and cable, construction, chemical processing, the general rubber industry, and in high-performance parts with excellent temperature, oil, and chemical resistance.  Examples of the end products made with DPP specialty elastomers include:\n\n- Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks;\n- Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high-performance timing belts;\n- Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to power transmission cable; and\n- Industrial applications - from protective gloves, O-rings, and gaskets to microwave door enclosures and chemical-resistant hoses.\n\nThe 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments established a statutory framework for assessing the risks to public health and the environment arising from the use of certain chemicals.  Regulations specifying what facilities must conduct these risk assessments, how to assess the risk, and what data to report were promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  These regulations are known as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule and are published in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). The DPE Chambers Works facility (facility) must comply with applicable sections of 40 CFR 68. This Executive Summary satisfies the RMP rule section 40 CFR A\u00c2\u00a7 68.155 requirements by providing a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities implemented at the facility. Topics include: \t\n\n- the facility's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n- a facility description and a list of the substances regulated under the RMP rule;\n- a summary of the worst-case and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures"

The DPP Chambers Works facility presently has 99 employees. \n\nThree of the substances listed under the RMP regulation are handled at the facility. These substances are:\n\nToxics:\nHydrogen Chloride - Anhydrous (AHCL)\n\nFlammables:\nVinylidene Fluoride (VF2)\nTetrafluoroethylene (TFE)\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe RMP rule requires that the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) be communicated to the public for toxic and flammable substances listed in the regulation and present at the facility above a threshold quantity.  The EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical in a 10-minute period. The worst-case scenario assumes the entire quantity is released, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nSince worst-case scenarios are very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the community. To make emergency response planning more effective, alternative release scenarios are used to provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if facility safety systems fail. The scenarios described below were developed using PHAST software. Similar scenario analysis and dispersion modeling has also been used for many years as a routine part of the facility Process Safety Management (PSM) practices.\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario is for Hydrogen Chloride. It assumes the release of the entire storage tank contents with no mitigation. This release has an off site impact. This release scenario is unlikely due to the design and construction requirements of the storage tank, and its fitness-for-service inspection program. \n\nThe first toxic alternative release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from pressure relief devices due to excess pressure build up within the s"

Corporate and facility goals are to prevent all employee injuries, accidental releases and process safety incidents. The facility has both corporate and local programs, procedures and management practices in place to support these goals. Performance against these goals is constantly assessed and communicated to employees. Achievement of these goals is recognized and rewarded. Failure to attain them is regarded as unacceptable performance and treated accordingly.\n\nThe DPP Chambers Works facility emergency response policy is to coordinate emergency response activities with DuPont's Chambers Works plant on-site emergency response personnel and fire department. Should an accidental release occur, appropriate emergency response actions would be taken to minimize the impact on employee safety, public health and the environment. \n\t\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DPP Chambers Works facility manufactures specialty elastomers that are used in industrial, automotive and aerospace applications. The facility occupies a small portion of DuPont's Chambers Works site located on Route 130 in Deepwater, New Jersey within Salem County. The DPP facility is a wholly owned subsidiary operated by DuPont employees. Because of its DuPont heritage at Chambers Works, DPP has a broad base of knowledge for, and ex"

Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  a storage tank refrigeration system to control tank pressure; control room monitoring of storage tank pressure; storage tank excess pressure alarms; tank refrigeration system failure alarms; storage tank insulation to limit pressure build up rate; controlled venting through a environmental scrubber; and increased process consumption from the tank.   \n\nThe second toxic alternative release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from a leak in a tank trailer unloading hose. This scenario assumes the release of HCL in a 30 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  requirements for operating personnel to be physically present during tank trailer liquid unloading; leak detection monitors surrounding the unloading area; unloading hose design, construction, and fitness-for-service program; and emergency response planning for this and similar release scenarios. \n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario is for Vinylidene Fluoride. It assumes the release of the entire contents of a tube trailer with no mitigation, and the presence of an ignition source. This release does not have an off site impact. This scenario is unlikely due to the design, construction and inspection requirements for over-the-road tube trailers. \n\nThe flammable alternative release scenario for Vinylidene Fluoride is the discharge from trailer tube pressure relief device due to excess pressure build up caused by tube overfilling.
