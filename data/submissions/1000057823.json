The Bethel Park Municipal Authority maintains quantities of chlorine at its Piney Fork Wastewater Treatment Plant above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and, as such, is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  An off-site consequence analysis was completed to determine the RMP program level applicable to the Authority's chlorine system.  Based on the worst-case release as defined by EPA, the facility is subject to RMP Program 2 requirements.\nThe elements of the RMP are listed below:\nProcess Hazard Assessment- Assess the potential impacts of worst-case and alternative release scenarios and compile a five-year accident history.\nPrevention Program- Implement a comprehensive management program that affects a wide variety of operation, training, and maintenance activities.\nEmergency Response- Implement an emergency action program for the covered processes.\nRisk Management Plan- Register and submit an RMP plan that includes an executive summary, RMP data elements, results of the hazard assessment, and summarizes how all other requirements are met.  The information presented in this section is intended to describe the elements of the Authority's Risk Management Program.  The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as dictated in 40 CFR Part 68.155 Executive Summary Section.\nExecutive Summary Data Elements-\nAccording to EPA guidelines the executive summary must include a brief description of the facility's Risk Management Program.

The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\nThe alternative release scenario is defined as the scenario that is most likely to occur in the event of a chlorine release.  For the Authority WWTP, this release would be a gas leak resulting from a valve, connection, or process tubing equipment failure.  Once the concentration in the chlorine building reaches 0.4 ppm, the chlorine alarm would sound and plant personnel would initiate their response procedures.  This scenario assumes the maximum amount of chlorine is released before any mitigation procedures can be performed.\nThe alternative release scenario is based upon a flashing liquid release through a 5/16 hole (valve body).  The toxic endpoint of 0.10 miles is based on a release rate of 10.5 lbs/minute for a 60 minute time period in an urban setting.  The toxic endpoint alternative scenario release distance of 0.10 mile was calculated using RMP*Comp, Version 1.07 for chlorine release.\nThe residential population within the 0.1-mile radius of influence was determined to be approximately 40.  The population was determined using the LandView III Environmental Mapping Software.  This software is distributed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and recommended by the USEPA for use in preparing Rick Management Plans. \n68.155(e) Five-year Accident History\nThe chlorination facility has been in place since the 1950's.  No accidents as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a) have occurred at this facility since it began operation.  \n68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program established by the Municipality does not required personnel to act as the site incident commander.

They would also be responsible for organizing any community evacuations in response to a significant chlorine release.  Fire department staff has the appropriate training for responding to an accidental release of chlorine.  A copy of the Emergency Response Plan is available upon request and is on file at the Piney Fork WWTP, the Municipal offices and at the local fire and police departments.\n68.155(g) Safety Improvements\nThe following items have been completed at the Piney Fork WWTP as recommended in the Process Hazard Review:\n- A meeting with local emergency responders to review the Emergency Response Plan is scheduled for October 4th, 2011.\nThe Process Hazard Review stresses the relationship between the standard operating procedures and safe operation of the chlorine system.  PHR recommendations are meant to provide Authority staff with areas for further investigation and consideration.  Recommendations were not implemented without considering their impacts on and relation to other systems and/or procedures."

This successful operating record is due to the Authority's commitment to training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities.  The Authority has consistently updated its policies and provided the necessary personnel training to enhance the safety of the operations at the Piney Fork WWTP.\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\nThe Authority operates a wastewater treatment plant located along Piney Fork Creek, South Park Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, having a permitted design capacity of approximately 4.92 million gallons per day (mgd).  The plant provides wastewater treatment to residential, commercial and light industrial users in South Park Township and portions of the Municipality of Bethel Park. \nChlorine used for disinfection purposes is supplied in 1-ton containers.  Two containers are usually on-line at any one time.  Typical usage ranges from 80 lb/day (minimum) to 125 lb/day (maximum).  The average feed rate is typically 100 lb/day.  The ton containers are stored in an isolated room in a brick and block building that is secured to prevent unauthorized access.  A chlorine leak detector is located within the building and sounds an audible alarm, an emergency beacon and activates a remote telephone call-out system when activated.\n68.155&copy; Offsite Consequence Analysis\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario were assessed for the chlorine process.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely.  Active mitigation measures can be used in determining the alternative release scenario while the worst-case scenario only allows consideration of pas"

This airborne concentration used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly overestimates the population potentially exposed to a single chlorine leak, because the chlorine plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the prominent winds.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.  The area around the Authority\u00c2\u00bfs plant is urban.  The environmental receptors include schools, businesses, recreational areas, churches and residential areas.\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nWorst-Case Release Scenario is determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 88.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c)\nAs described in USEPA 40 CFR Park 68.25(b), the worst-case scenario shall be the greater of the following:\n1. The greatest amount held in a single vessel or\n2. The greatest amount in a pipe\nFor the chlorine process at the Authority's WWTP, the worst-case release will occur if a one-ton cylinder (maximum amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine ruptures and its contents escape to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  In the event the one-ton cylinder would release its entire contents to the atmosphere in 10 minutes, the release rate would be 110 pounds per minute.
