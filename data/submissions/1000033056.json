Heinz Company L.P., complies with the requirements set forth under EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68).  \r\nThis plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at Heinz Frozen Food.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the Heinz Frozen Food design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Heinz Frozen Food has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\r\n\r\n1.1.\tCorporate Commitment to Safety\r\n\r\nHeinz Frozen Food is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining Zero Accident Tolerance through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.\tIt is the policy of Heinz Frozen Food to:\r\n\r\n1.1.1.1\tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.2\tComply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.3\tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.4\tEnsure, throug"

In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\r\n\r\n1.1.4.\tHeinz Frozen Food has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process.  It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\r\n\r\n1.1.5.\tThe first duty of Heinz Frozen Food employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tFacility Description\r\n\r\nHeinz Frozen Food is a food processing facility where food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, assembled, frozen and packaged for shipment to end users.
