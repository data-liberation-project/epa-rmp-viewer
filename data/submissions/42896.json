Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n\no\tAs a result of information gathered during preparation this Risk Management Program, Wanchese Fish Company \u00bf Suffolk Cold Storage Facility (WFC) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of the WFC\u00bfs high degree of commitment to public safety and service, WFC is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulate substances handled\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the WFC Suffolk Cold Storage facility refrigeration system.

Wanchese Fish Company \u00bf Suffolk Cold Storage has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  WFC conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.  The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7.\tPlanned charges to improve safety\n\no\tWanchese Fish Company \u00bf Suffolk Cold Storage is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows WFC to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of WFC employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
