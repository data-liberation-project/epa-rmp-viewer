Facility uses Epichlorohydrin to manufacture products. The maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin (CAS # 106-89-8) at the facility at any given time is 73,800 lbs.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility stores, handles and uses a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\n- Epichlorohydrin (CAS # 106-89-8)  - 73,800 lbs\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nSouthern Chemical & Textile, Inc., has a policy to check the equipment regularly, that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operations at the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\nFacility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place following to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This program consists of process safety issues, which includes following information:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the standard operating procedures associated with all equipment and systems.\n\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\n- Trainings: Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes ar"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: storage tank, piping systems, bulk tank truck, relief and vent systems, and nitrogen blanket. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n- Compliance audits: Facility conducts audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 11/12/2018. Actions required as result of the audits are undertaken in safe and prompt manner. \n\n- Incident Investigation: Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nEpichlorohydrin storage tank is located in a diked contained area to contain any spills and prevent any vehicles or forklifts collisions. A nitrogen blanket is used for the storage tank to ensure the tank contents remain at less than 8 percent oxygen.  The storage tank will be equipped with level measurement, alarms and shutdown of unloading pumps to avoid overfilling. \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of all covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nFacility emergency response plan includes immediately evacuating facility of"

This facility carries a written emergency preparedness and response action plan to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release of hazardous materials. The employees will take actions only on incidental responses such as small chemical spills.\n\nFacility employees are aware of the limits of an incidental response and have been trained on the proper steps to follow for emergency notification and employee evacuation procedures in case of a release of a regulated substance. Appropriate procedures are in place to notify emergency responders such as the Local Fire Department or Whitfield County LEPC. The Whitfield County Emergency Management Agency plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nFacility constantly improves the safety of the processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and safety suggestions from the employees. There are currently no major planned changes to improve safety.\n\n"
