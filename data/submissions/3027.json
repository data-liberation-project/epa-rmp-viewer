      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe North Chicago Water Treatment Plant (NCWTP) uses chlorine, a chemical considered hazardous and toxic by USEPA, to disinfect the drinking water supply.  Because chlorine is toxic, it is necessary to observe certain precautions in handling it in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the population living or working on adjacent properties.  It is the policy of the NCWTP to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safe handling of chlorine depends on adherence to safe handling procedures, incorporation of proper safety devices into  the design of the chlorine facility, and adequate training of all facility personnel with respect to handling procedures and safety devices.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the North Chicago Fire Department and any potentially affected neighbors. \n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe NCWTP purifies water for use as drinking water in the City of North Chicago.  In addition, it supplies disinfected water to Abbott Labs for use in cooling towers.  Chlorine is supplied to the facility in 1-ton cylinders by delivery trucks.  The storage capacity of the facility is 16,000 pounds (8 one-ton cylinders).  Access to the chlorine room is restricted to authorized Water Department employees and management personnel, and to vendor delivery personnel.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario is the failure of a storage cylinder containing 2,000lb of chlorine.  For assumed conditions of 1.5 m/s wind velocity, F stability class, and 25 C temperature at 50% humidity, the distance to the endpoint of 0.0087mg/L for a 2,000-lb release in a 10-minute time period is 1.3 miles for an urban area.  A 1.3-mi radius from the NCWTP includes the Great Lakes Naval Training Facility, most of the City of North Chicago and part of the City of Waukegan, or an estimated total population of"

For assumed conditions of 3 m/s wind velocity, D stability class, and a 3/4-in valve, the distance to the endpoint for an urban area was found to be 0.2 mi.  Other alternate scenarios were evaluated but found to have smaller release rates and consequently smaller distances to the endpoint.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nThis facility complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule, OSHAs Process Safety Management Rule and all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn accidental release occurred on 4/28/1998, as a result of a broken valve.  There were no off-site injuries or off-site damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program for the NCWTP was based on Pamphlet 64 of the Chlorine Institute and emergency response protocols contained in SARA Title III."
