If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify the Mills County Communications Center by calling 911 of 712-527-4844.\n\nThis facility is a fertilizer retail outlet which unloads semi-trailer loads of anhydrous ammonia into a storage tank and then re-loads the product into 1,000 gallon nurse wagons for farmer use as a source of nitrogen for crop production.\n\nOur worst-case release scenario is a failure of our 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles.  There are private homes and a public school within the distance to the endpoint with a total population of 1431.  There are several small businesses in one story buildings with seven or less employees each.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property, environmental damage, or evacuations.  In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous facility, it is our policy to notify the Mills County Communications Center, who will notify the local fire department, rescue squad, law enforcement, and County Emergency Coordinator.  This is according to the SARA Title III plan adopted by the County Emergency Coordinator for the direction and control of hazardous materials.\n\nWe will review safety procedures yearly and make any changes we see necessary.\n\nWe have discussed this policy with the fire department and we will provide them with a walk through inspection at any time."
