In service to the community, the City has a history of adhering to proactive approaches for the prevention and emergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances.  Current prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\nThe Facility is located in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida and utilizes chlorine gas in the water treatment process.  The Facility maintains a semi-enclosed (one end open, east exposure) chlorination area and chlorination distribution system on-site.  Chlorine is delivered to the central area and stored on-site in cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure when full.  The chlorine facility holds a maximum of fourteen 2,000 pound cylinders.\n\nThe Facility has an outstanding performance history in conjunction with handling, storing, maintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No reportable accidental releases have occurred since the system went into service in 1969.  The water treatment plant is manned 24 hours/day, seven (7) days/week, 365 days/year.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe handling, maintenance and opeation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The chlorination system is designed utilizing latest technologies and industry specific design codes and standards.  The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Operational staff are trained according to these response plans.\n\nThe EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios for"

      "SummaryText": " toxic substances identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case release\" is defined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA specifies the parameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its \"toxic endpoint.\"  The alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\", such as a pipe leak.\n\nUtilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a distance of 3.5 miles was calculated for the worst case release toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.  As per EPA regulations, the population is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic endpoints.  These population values are 60,501 for the worst case and 881 for the alternative release.  It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative release scenario, the population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being more in the form of an elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a circle centered on the point source.\n\nThe use of chlorination for water treatment has yielded enormous benefits in this are related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.  The City, like other modern treatment facilities understands the value and the risks of this treatment procedure.  The City has an exceptional track record of no accidental releases in its history and remains vigilant in its attention to safety regarding chlorine.  The City supports this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general vicinity of any utility of the risks associated with accidental gseous releases.  We support efforts to notify the public of risks at all points of exposure including the production, delivery and site storage of chlorine gas.\n\nIf you have any questions on this matter, yu may contact the offices"
