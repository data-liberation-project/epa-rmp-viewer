When activated the alarm will shut off the weigh tank inlet valve and stop the Epichlorohydrin feed pump and display an alarm on the computer.\n\nVent System\nThe system vents back to the Epichlorohydrin bulk tank during filling and normal breathing. The closed vent system eliminates the venting of Epichlorohydrin vapors in the area. \n\nFlow Restriction Orifice\nA Flow Restriction Orifice is installed in the weigh tank discharge lines to prevent emptying the tank to the reactors in less than 30 minutes. The orifice is a back-up to the discharge flow control system, and the computer safety interlock programming. Should either of these fail, the orifice will restrict the Epichlorohydrin addition rate to the reactors to prevent the potential for a hot reaction. The flow addition is computer controlled to less than 50 lbs./min faster addition rates can cause the reaction to run hot. \n\nReactor Charge Valve Interlock\nThe reactor Epichlorohydrin charge valves are tied into a hard-wired safety interlock system which will prevent the valves from opening unless specific conditions are satisfied to allow charging Epichlorohydrin to the reactors (liquid level in reactor is above 40 %, temperature is below 65 ?C during the charge). This prevents accidental out of sequence charging of Epichlorohydrin to the reactors and guards against the potential of a \u0093hot\u0094 or runaway reaction. \n\nSafety Reli"

Pressure relief valves are set to 35 psig.  The charging process is completely sealed in that all vapor displacement goes back and forth between the bulk tank and charge tank.

This qualifies HUNTSMAN as a level 3 process in conjunction with our facility being classified under NAICS 325211. \n\n2.3\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Parameters (68.22 and Appendix A)\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis parameters are listed below. A brief description of each parameter is included for clarification:\n\n\n2.3.1\tEndpoint (A)\t\n\nThe toxic endpoint concentration of Epichlorohydrin as defined by the EPA is 0.076 mg/l. This concentration represents the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guidance (ERPH)-2. This endpoint concentration is defined as \u0093the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believe that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects of symptoms which could impair an individual\u0092s ability to take protection action.\u0094\n\n\n2.3.2\tWind"

The boiling point temperature for Epichlorohydrin is 241 F, thus Epichlorohydrin is a liquid at ambient temperature. In addition, it is assumed that there is no passive mitigation system in place. Therefore, the release rate was set at 18,900 lbs. /min.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions; results demonstrate a distance of 0.7 miles to the toxic endpoint.
