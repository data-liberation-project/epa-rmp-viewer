This plant has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  Gabriel has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to this facility.\n\n\n\n    1.1. Accidental release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (a) \n\n\n\nGabriel's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.s. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program. \n\n\n\n1.1.1. Management System (a)(I) \n\n\n\nGabriel has a management system in place which is lead by their Plant Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with plant specific policies, eliminates and or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant. \n\n\n\n1.1.2. Prevention Program Level 3 (a)(2) \n\n\n\nGabriel maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to the entire facility plus RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in the plants OSHA PSM program.\n\n\n\n1.2. Gabriel Source and Regulated Substances Handled at the Rock Hill Site (b) \n\n\n\nGabriel employs 38 full-time employees engaged in plant and administrative operations.  Epichlorohydrin is used in the plant operations.\n\n\n\n1.2.1.Site Description (b)(1) \n\n\n\nThe site is owned and operated by Gabriel.  The site is located at 808 Cel-River Rd., Rock Hill, SC  29730.  The site is bordered by Cherry Road on the west, Cel-River Rd. on the South, Greens of Rock Hill on the North, and Eden Terrace Extension on the East.\n\n\n\nThe Plant includes an epichlorohydrin storage and charging system contained in specially designed storage vessels and ancillary equipment within the processing b"

Regulated Substances (b)(2) \n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin is the regulated substances on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Epichlorohydrin process was istalled as part of the process for manufacturing Phenoxy Resin.  It operates under permit from the State of South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC).  The epichlorohydrin is received in railcars or tanker containers which are unloaded upon arrival at the site into our Epichlorohydrin Bulk Storage Tank.\n\n\n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin is an EPA toxic chemical.  It is an irritant, flammable and it is corrosive.  Epichlorohydrin is liquid with the formula C3H5ClO.  It has a 10 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and an NFPA health rating of 3; with acute health hazards and fire hazards.\n\n\n\n1.3. Worst and Alternatative Case Release Scenarios (c) \n\n\n\nREMOVED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES\n\n\n\n1.4. Accidental Release Prevention Program (d) \n\n\n\nThe Gabriel accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.\n\n\n\n1.4.1. General Accidental release Prevention Program (d)(I) \n\n\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below: \n\n\n\nGabriel has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\n\n\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.

These include: \n\n\n\nSpecific procedures for the operation of the epichlorohydrin process. \n\n\n\nCompletion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to start up of a modified system.  In addition, Pre-Activity Planning Sheets are required whenever anyone participates in an activity that could result in serous injury or death.

These materials are made of carbon or stainless steel with epichlorohydrin compatible gasketing materials.  The maximum pressure the epichlorohydrin system should see at any given time is limited to 150 psig and dictated by the pump pressure.  Pressure relief valves ensure any releases return back into the system.\n\n\n\n1.5. Five-Year Accident History (e) \n\n\n\nGabriel has had no accidental releases of epichlorohydrin in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 68.42 (a).  All accidents resulting in death, injury, significant property damage resulting from a release from a covered process are reported according to EPA 40 CFR 68.42 (a).\n\n\n\n1.6. Emergency Response Program (1) \n\n\n\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Gabriel Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response \"decision tree\" and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site-specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the senior staff.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\n\n\nBesides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of Gabriel.\n\n\n\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to spills (releases). The plan includes training of all plant operators.  The primary response team includes the local fire department and rescue, plus the HazMat Team (all off site).  All of these respond to severe leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.\n\n\n\nIf a reportable quantity release of an RMP covered chemical occurs, the National Response Center is contacted at 800-424-8802.
