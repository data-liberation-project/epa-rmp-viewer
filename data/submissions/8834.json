      "SummaryText": "WINN-DIXIE STORES, INC.- POMPANO WAREHOUSE FACILITY\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1. Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Winn-Dixie) Pompano Warehouse Facility (Pompano Warehouse) is the headquarters for the Miami Division of Winn-Dixie located in Pompano, Florida.  Winn-Dixie requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixies corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Pompano Warehouse is located at 1141 S.W. 12th Avenue in the southwest corner of Pompano, Florida.  The warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Pompano Warehouse has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration systems equipment is located in the southwest corner of the building in the southwest corner of the property in a machine or compressor room.  The compressor room is where the high pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the warehouse building.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding approximately 10,500 lbs. of Ammonia.  \n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of the HPR, releasing 10,500 lbs. of ammonia gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, taking into consideration the enclosure, the ammonia gas could travel 0.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 8834,
      "SummaryText": "/L),  using the Ammonia Guidance Table results.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenarios is a leak at a rate of 360 lb./min. from the HPR liquid supply line due to pipe connection failure from worker/human error or corrosion of the pipe.  Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration the enclosure and the reduced inventory of ammonia in the HPR under normal conditions, the ammonia gas could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the Ammonia Guidance results.\n\n\n\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Pompano Warehouse refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Pompano Warehouse facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Pompano Warehouse has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was re-engineered in 1998 for the ammonia process.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Pompano Warehouse also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Ass"

Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Pompano Warehouse refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Pompano Warehouse facility has had two accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  One release occurred on May 21, 1997, it started at 5:30 am and ended at 8:30 am.  It occurred during the normal operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  An unloader solenoid valve manual jack stem and bonnet became loose which allowed it to unscrew and the manual jack stem disengaged from the unloader solenoid valve housing.  The valve then was ejected from compressor #2, thus making a 0.75 inch opening in which ammonia gas could escape.  The release was smelled offsite and the Pompano Beach Fire Department HAZMAT team and Winn Dixies HAZMAT team did respond.  Employees were evacuated out of the warehouse but not offsite.  No in"

      "SummaryText": "juries, deaths, or damages were incurred onsite or offsite, except for the cost of replacing the unloader solenoid valve.\n\nThe second release that occurred at the Pompano Warehouse did not go offsite and the Fire Department did respond but determined there was no evidence of a problem.   A leak was found in a coil of an evaporator and was valved off and after some time had passed it was determined that the valve was not holding and was replaced.  In the same room another leak in a hot gas line was discovered that had been attributed to the ammonia smell in the freezer room.  The valves and piping were replaced in this room.  Actions taken as a result of both these incidents by the Winn-Dixie include stepping up preventive maintenance to prevent any more leaks.   \n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Pompano Warehouse Facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Pompano Beach Fire Department, and the State  Emergency Response Commission.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 or (954) 786-4330, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
