The tanks and associated equipment  have been designed, installed and inspected to ensure 100% compliance with this rule.\r\nIn addition gas detectors have been  strategically located in the storage and processing areas to ensure that  the smallest of leaks of the regulated  materials used are detected  quickly. \r\nRemotely Operated isolation valves have been installed to allow for  the safe shutdown and isolation of equipment  by operating personnel  to minimize the amount of flammable material that can leak to atmosphere.\r\nAn emergency plan for the site has been developed and communicated with the local fire department  and has been integrated in to the local Community Emergency Response Plan.  Material  Safety Data sheets have been included with the emergency plan so that  first responders understand the hazards associated with the materials.\r\nThe process meets the requirements of  EPA's Risk management Program Level 3. All requirements of Program Level 3 have been met such as Mechanical Inspections, Critical Instrumentation calibration and interlock checks, safe operating and maintenance procedures,  operator training and refresher training , hot work, process hazards analysis and emergency procedures have been developed.\r\nThe ownership of the company is committed to minimizing the risk of accidental spills of the regulated substances.
