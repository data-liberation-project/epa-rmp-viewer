The RMPr includes all Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Although not required but to be consistent with management of all RMP processes, TMC extends the Program 3 elements including Employee Participation, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change to this process.  The Program 3 elements are specifically required for the Ammonium Polyphosphate process. \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1 (i.e. Railcar Storage) equipment may include up to six 34,000-gallon railcars.  TMC does not own the railcars and therefore is not responsible for the mechanical integrity of the railcar.  However, trained TMC personnel receive, inspect, and release railcars in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Railcar Operating Procedures.  TMC is responsible for training its personnel in the Railcar Operating Procedures.  Transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars to the storage tanks is considered to be part of Covered Process 2 (i.e. Storage and Handling ? Anhydrous Ammonia).\n\n",

The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\n\n\nCovered Process 3 (i.e. Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting) equipment associated with this covered process includes a mobile pipe reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).   Ammonium Polyphosphate (i.e. 10-34-0) is a fertilizer that is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with water and super-phosphoric acid in a ?stationary reactor? (i.e. Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting).  When manufacturing Ammonium Polyphosphate, the IFRC connects its MPR to (1) one of the two anhydrous ammonia stationary storage tanks, (2) the water supply at the Creston Facility, and (3) a railcar containing the super-phosphoric acid.  The IFRC transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the stationary storage tank to its MPR.  The IFRC is responsible for the transfer of anhydrous ammonia when its equipment is connected to the stationary storage tank.  The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the MPR operations.\n\n",

The RMPr includes all Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Although not required but to be consistent with management of all RMP processes, TMC extends the Program 3 elements including Employee Participation, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change to this process.  The Program 3 elements are specifically required for the Ammonium Polyphosphate process. \n\n\n\nCovered Process 4 (i.e. Aqua Ammonium Reacting) equipment includes the Reactor and ancillary pumps, piping, and valves.  The reactor is physically connected by process piping to the stationary storage tanks.  Aqua-ammonia is a fertilizer that is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia and water in a ?stationary reactor? (i.e. Aqua Ammonia Reacting) to make a solution that is up to 24% aqua ammonia by weight.  The Aqua Ammonium Reacting (AAR) process equipment is owned and operated by TMC.  The AAR does not have any storage capabilities for anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transferred from one of the two stationary storage tanks by process piping to the AAR.  After blending, the aqua ammonia product is transferred by piping to one of the three 33,500-gallon stationary storage tanks located in the liquids storage tank farm.  \n\n\n\nBecause the aqua ammonia product has a concentration of 20% or greater, it is subject to the EPA RMP and therefore the storage of aqua ammonia is also subject to the PSM/RMPr (See Covered Process 5).  Trained Process Operators at Creston perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia to the AAR, operate the AAR, and then transfer the aqua ammonia to storage in accordance with the AAR Operating Procedures.  Trained TMC personnel perform the maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Mechanical Integrity Procedures.  TMC is responsible for training its personnel in the Operating and Maintenance Procedures.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of The McGregor Company (TMC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The EPA Subpart D standards are applicable to 4 of the 5 covered processes and the OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to 1 of the 5 covered process operations in Creston, WA.  At this Facility, TMC engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use TMC's products to support agricultural operations.  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia from the Creston Facility located approximately 0.4 miles west of Creston, WA at 20501 East Hills Road Creston, WA 99117.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Creston Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Creston Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nTMC is submitting this plan as a first time submission of all applicable sections of the RMP as this is a new Facility and Operation.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been addressed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at the Creston Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Creston Facility stores and handles two covered chemicals (anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA, and operates fi"

The five covered processes include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Program 2)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Handling (Program 2)\n\no    Covered Process 3: Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting (Program 3)\n\no    Covered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Reacting (Program 2)\n\no    Covered Process 5: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling (Program 2)\n\n\n\nThe Creston Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar and NH3 Semi Trucks and stores the anhydrous ammonia in one of two stationary storage tanks.  From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia may be transferred to NH3 Field Delivery Truck(s) for transportation to the client location, or may be transferred to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting (Covered Process 3) and the Aqua Ammonia Reacting (Covered Process 4) for the blending of ammonium polyphosphate or aqua ammonia.  Because the aqua ammonia is greater than 20% concentration, the storage and handling of the aqua ammonia is also covered under the PSM/RMPr.  TMC trains all of its Process Operators and Maintenance Personnel in the relevant operating and maintenance procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 1,261,505 lbs (assuming that the two stationary storage tanks and six railcars are filled to their administrative capacity), and the total aqua ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 156,972 lbs (assuming that the three stationary storage tanks are filled to their administrative capacity).  The total quantity that RMP Submit calculates is high because Covered Processes 3 and 4 have no actual storage but are connected to the stationary storage tanks whose quantity is included in the 1,261,505 lbs.  Thus the quantity in the storage tanks is counted 3 times rather than only one time as it should be.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst"

      "SummaryText": " case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all five covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia, the release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet.  For the aqua ammonia, the release was modeled as if the stationary storage tank failed and instantaneously spilling the content within the diked containment and the resulting release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1); (2) rupture of a transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation (Covered Processes 2, 3 and 5); and (3) release of anhydrous ammonia from the flex hose connection that connects the stationary storage tank to the aqua ammonia reactor (Covered Process 4).  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and check valves) and operating procedures that TMC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Creston Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Creston Manager is assisted by other trained TMC staff, as directed.  The Creston Manager is responsible for ensuring that TMC Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance A"
