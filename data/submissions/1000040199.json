      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of The McGregor Company (TMC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768.  The EPA Subpart D standards are applicable to 4 of the 5 covered processes and the OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to 1 of the 5 covered process operations in Creston, WA.  At this Facility, TMC engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use TMC's products to support agricultural operations.  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia from the Creston Facility located approximately 0.4 miles west of Creston, WA at 20501 East Hills Road Creston, WA 99117.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Creston Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Creston Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nTMC is submitting this plan as a first time submission of all applicable sections of the RMP as this is a new Facility and Operation.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been addressed.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Operations at the Creston Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Creston Facility stores and handles two covered chemicals (anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA, and operates fi"

      "SummaryText": "ve (5) covered processes that involve storage, handling, and manufacturing of the covered chemicals.  The five covered processes include:\r\n\r\no\tCovered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Program 2)\r\no\tCovered Process 2: Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Handling (Program 2)\r\no\tCovered Process 3: Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting (Program 3)\r\no\tCovered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Reacting (Program 2)\r\no\tCovered Process 5: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling (Program 2)\r\n\r\nThe Creston Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar and NH3 Semi Trucks and stores the anhydrous ammonia in one of two stationary storage tanks.  From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia may be transferred to NH3 Field Delivery Truck(s) for transportation to the client location, or may be transferred to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting (Covered Process 3) and the Aqua Ammonia Reacting (Covered Process 4) for the blending of ammonium polyphosphate or aqua ammonia.  Because the aqua ammonia is greater than 20% concentration, the storage and handling of the aqua ammonia is also covered under the PSM/RMPr.  TMC trains all of its Process Operators and Maintenance Personnel in the relevant operating and maintenance procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 1,261,505 lbs (assuming that the two stationary storage tanks and six railcars are filled to their administrative capacity), and the total aqua ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 156,972 lbs (assuming that the three stationary storage tanks are filled to their administrative capacity).  The total quantity that RMP Submit calculates is high because Covered Processes 3 and 4 have no actual storage but are connected to the stationary storage tanks whose quantity is included in the 1,261,505 lbs.  Thus the quantity in the storage tanks is counted 3 times rather than only one time as it should be.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst"

      "SummaryText": "case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all five covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia, the release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet.  For the aqua ammonia, the release was modeled as if the stationary storage tank failed and instantaneously spilling the content within the diked containment and the resulting release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.\r\n\r\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1); (2) rupture of a transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation (Covered Processes 2, 3 and 5); and (3) release of anhydrous ammonia from the flex hose connection that connects the stationary storage tank to the aqua ammonia reactor (Covered Process 4).  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and check valves) and operating procedures that TMC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Creston Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Creston Manager is assisted by other trained TMC staff, as directed.  The Creston Manager is responsible for ensuring that TMC Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance A"

The RMP will be updated as the Creston Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes.  The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Lincoln County LEPC and Creston Fire Department.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Creston Facility."
