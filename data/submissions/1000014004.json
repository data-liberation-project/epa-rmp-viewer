      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \nA.  It is the commitment of the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Cogeneration Plant, and Polymer Plant at Clinton, Iowa to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent toxic release of anhydrous ammonia and in the unlikely event of a release to minimize the potential impact to ADM's employees, the public, and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Clinton Fire Department.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility consists of a Cogeneration plant that utilizes coal-fired boilers to supply the neighboring Corn Processing and Polymer plant with their energy requirements in the form of steam and electricity. The adjacent Polymer plant utilizes a biological fermentation process to produce a biodegradable plastic polymer. \n\nThe regulated substance used at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a reagent to reduce oxides of nitrogen air emissions in the coal-fired boilers in a process known as SNCR (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction). The SNCR system is a new installation and was commissioned on September 8, 2008. Anhydrous ammonia is also used as fermentation feedstock in the fermenters at the Polymer plant. The anhydrous ammonia piping is a new installation and was commissioned on November 17, 2009.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system consists of two storage tanks physically located at the Cogeneration plant. The anhydrous ammonia is transported to the boilers and fermenters via three vaporizers and associated piping. \n\nC.  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis, ADM used the EPA's ALOHA 5.4.1 modeling package, the program LandView 5, and EPA"

      "SummaryText": "guidance documents. Final distances to toxic endpoints were determined and used to estimate the total affected populations. Results of the scenarios may be over-estimated, however, as several blocks of residences in the immediate area of the facility have been purchased by ADM and demolished for expansion projects.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Toxic Substances: The worst-case scenario for substances that are normally gases at ambient temperatures but are liquefied by pressure assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically and the entire contents are released as a gas over a ten-minute period resulting in offsite impacts.  The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from the two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. These tanks are physically integrated to operate as one unit, so the worst-case scenario involves the loss of anhydrous ammonia from both tanks.  Safe handling procedures, work practices and the safety devices inherent in the design of the containers make this scenario extremely unlikely.\n\nAlternative Scenario: EPA requires that one alternative scenario, or more realistic scenario, be evaluated for each toxic substance.  EPA also requires that each alternative scenario result in off-site impacts, if such a scenario exists.  A more realistic release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia would be a release from the pressure relief devices due to overpressurization.  No active or passive mitigation measures were considered for this scenario.\n\nD.  Accidental Release Prevention\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention program are the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Program under 29 CFR 1910.119, which this facility's RMP process is subject to.  These concepts include: employee participation, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, and contractor programs.  \n\nE.

Emergency Response Program\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel and the LEPC and/or City of Clinton Fire Department so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with prevention of, and response to, accidental releases of hazardous materials.  \n\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nADM conducted Process Hazard Analysis in conjunction with the Process Safety Management Program prior to startup of the ammonia system and prior to the commissioning of the Polymer piping. Both plants continue to perform PHAs in conjunction with the MOC process. \n\nUpdates to procedures are planned as a result of the most recent PHA. \n\nBoth ADM Polymer and Cogeneration will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the facility."
