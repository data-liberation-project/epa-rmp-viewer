These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe James River Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training and/or communication on the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe James River Plant will promptly investigate all incidents that result in, or have potential to cause a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root causes and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, a plan to correct the deficiency is developed and tracked to completion.  \nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The James River Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe James River Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents such as procedures and forms to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the James River Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Core Team.   In addition, the James River Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe James River Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consid"

      "SummaryText": "e following PSM information in this executive summary, since these practices are already in place at the facility.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst-Case Releases\n\nFlammable Substances\nThe James River Plant does not store any flammable substances  in the threshold quantities listed in the regulation; therefore, it does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Oleum is the only regulated toxic substance at the James River Plant. \n\nFor the 20% oleum storage vessel, passive mitigation exists and was considered in calculating air emissions.  The product from the oleum storage tank will be kept in a containment area which will contain the entire contents of the tank.  Administrative controls are also in place which allow for filling to 90% of the tank capacity.  High level alarms are also in place to ensure this control.  In addition, an automatic overflow into another vessel further ensures that the tank capacity will not be exceeded. \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the oleum tank remains on-site and does not affect any public receptors.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated based on the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Document.\n\nAlternative Releases\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence- line.  Since the James River Plant is in Program 1 of the ARP, the alternative release scenarios is not required."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nVeolia's James River Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe James River Plant manufactures and processes specialty chemicals in Chesterfield County, Virginia.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\n\nThe James River Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity established by the U.S. EPA.  Based on process knowledge, Veolia identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses oleum, which is the only regulated substances in the process.\n\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] do not exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, the James River facility has had no accidents with off-site impact over the last five years and has coordinated with the local emergency responders.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process is classified as Program 1 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\nThe James River Plant is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM). It is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819, and is providing th"
