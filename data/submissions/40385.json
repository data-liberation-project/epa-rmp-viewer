P&O Cold Logistics currently has several operating and maintenance programs in effect which are designed to greatly reduce the potential for any releases occuring at the facilty. The programs include written operating and maintenance procedures, daily operating logs, documentation of inspection and maintenance of equipment, emergency response training with emergency responders, and operation of equipment be RETA certified operators on a 24 hour/7 day per week basis. Other risk reducing measures include siesmic piping, equipment restraints, by-pass relief valves in portions of piping where liquid could become trapped, and ammonia detectors throughout the facility that are linked to emergency shut-off valves should ammonia vapors be detected. Anhydrous ammonia is the only acutely hazardous material used at the facility. The current system charge is 20,000 pounds."

      "SummaryText": "The P&O Cold Logistics facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the refrigeration and cold storage services provided customers. Refrigeration capacity is provided from a central engine room and refrigerant is transported to various freezing and cooling systems located throughout the facility via a piping system. An evaluation was performed using a what if hazard evaluation criteria as set forth in The guidelines for Chemical Hazard Evaluation Procedures prepared by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. This method was used to identify the potential hazards assciated with the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, and the likely consequences of those hazards when an accidentail release event is experianced, including those due to earthquake, equipment failure, operator error, design deficiencies, and maintenance procedures. The facility is operated by Refrigeration Engineers and Technitions Association(RETA) certified refrigeration operators, and the equipment is in good condition and maintained to established maintenance standards. In addition, various controls are utilized to maintain equipment at proper operating ranges and to automatically provide shut down in the event that equipment begins to operate out of the designed safe range. All equipment utilized in the refrigeration system is rated for the use of ammonia refrigerant. Storage and operating vessels are ASME rated and employ emergency pressure relief valves required by code for vessel protection. Due to the many safety features of the facility, including documanted operating procedures, ammonia releases other than small leaks are considered unlikely. Our controls were put to a real life test on July 31, 2003 when our plant experianced an ammonia leak. Our controls in place and training given to responding personnel, resulted in no injuries or off site consequences. Since that time, additional safety measures have been implemented to further reduce the likelyhood and consequences"
