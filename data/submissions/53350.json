The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10000 pounds. No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Beaver Street Fisheries facility.\n\n3.0 Accidental release prevention program.\n\nBeaver Street Fisheries standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR guidelines. Accidental release prevention practices at Beaver Street Fisheries include:\n\n- Continuing operator training.\n- Routine preventative maintenance.\n- Refrigeration system repairs made in a prompt, safe manner.\n- Labeling of ammonia system pipes and components.\n- Safe work practices followed.\n- Security and alarm system.\n- Constant monitoring of the system.\n\n4.0 5 year accident history.\n\nNo releases or accidents, involving anhydrous ammonia, that are rteportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\n5.0 Emergency response program.\n\nDuring normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (public address system) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Jacksonville Fire Department.
