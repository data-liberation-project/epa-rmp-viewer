This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that the company invested in accident prevention including:\nX    Personnel Training Management Program\nX    Consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility\n\nIt is our policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of any regulated substances.  The facilities Emergency Response Plan includes:\nX    Procedures for notification of trained personnel to respond\nX    Control and contain the release\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nLybrook Plant operates a cryogenic and fractionation natural gas liquids extraction process.  Commercial grade Methane is produced by extracting propane, butane, and two separate flammable mixtures of natural gas liquids from the inlet stream of unprocessed natural gas.  We have 5 regulated natural gas liquids present in our facility that are initially separated into individual components. The separated components are blended back together at the end of the process except for propane. Propane is sold to external customers and the blended components are shipped via liquid pipeline.  They include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline liquids.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Methane at our facility is 10,400 lbs.  While Ethane is present in a maximum quantity of 227,000 lbs., Propane has maximum quantity of 1,970,000 lbs.; Butane has maximum quantity of 384,000 lbs. and natural gasoline liquids maximum quantity is 384,000 lbs.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion involving 100% of a single storage inventory of one of our product tanks, containing a propane gas liquids, which i"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.586 miles. \n \nThe alternative release scenario with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion involving 100% of a single storage inventory of one of our product tanks, containing a flammable mixture, which is a regulated substance at 42,000 lbs.  The flammable mixture storage inventory is assumed to release and finds an ignition source, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.46 miles. \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Lybrook Facility encourages employees to participate in all aspects of Process Safety Management, Risk Management, and Accident Prevention.  Employee participation range from updating and compiling technical data for Operating and Maintenance Procedures and Process Safety information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis team.  In addition, Lybrook has a number of initiatives that address Process Safety, Risk Management, and accident prevention. These initiatives include:\nX    Forming teams promoting process safety\nX    Forming teams promoting the safety and health of all individuals\n\nMembers of the teams represent various areas and functions of the plant.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe Lybrook Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain the safe operation of covered processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis information.  This information, in conjunction with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for eval"

These processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage identified hazards. PHA methods utilized for identifying hazards include:\nX    -What if Process\nX    Hazop Techniques\n\nPHA's are conducted utilizing a team of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process along with accident prevention, and mitigating measures. The team addresses suggestions for additional prevention measures when appropriate, and forwards their findings and recommendations to management for resolution. The findings are classified according to relative risk rankings assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking ensures that the potential accident scenarios that are assigned the highest risk will receive immediate attention.  All approved action items resulting from the PHA team's findings are tracked until brought to completion. All PHA's team findings, recommendations, and tracking status are documented and retained. Revalidation of all PHA's is conducted on a 5-year cycle.\n\nProcedures\n\nOperating Procedures\nLybrook maintains written operating procedures providing clean instructions that address various modes of process operations, including:\nX    Initial startup\nX    Normal operations\nX    Temporary operations\nX    Emergency shutdown\nX    Emergency operations\nX    Normal shutdown\nX    Startup after turnaround\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of newly assigned operators.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors comply with the following:\nX    Perform their scope of work in a safe manner\nX    Are aware of hazards involved within the workplace\nX    Understand and verify contractors knowledge of emergency requirements\nX    Understand and verify contractors follow site safety rules\nX    Inform plant personnel of any hazards identified while performing their scope of work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with the following prior tot the start of their assigned project:\nX    Process Overview\nX    Information about Safety and Health Hazards\nX    Emergency Response Plan Requirements\nX    Safe Work Practices\nX    Best Work Practices\n \nLybrook personnel periodically conduct safety audits, work assessments, and evaluations on contractor performance ensuring working is completed in a safe manner.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nLybrook conducts a PSSR on any Plant modification that requires a change in process safety information.
