      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Chlor Alkali Company Inc. - Henderson, Henderson, NV 89009\n\nIntroduction \n\nPioneer Americas LLC, dba Olin Chlor Alkali Products' (Olin)Henderson Nevada facility is a is a medium sized manufacturing facility that presently produces sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), chlorine, muriatic acid (HCL) and sodium hypochlorite (bleach). The raw materials and resources consumed manufacturing in the operation are salt (sodium chloride), water, and electricity. Diaphragm cells are used to separate the salt water into chlorine, sodium and hydrogen.\n\n\nDemographic Profile \n\nThe Henderson facility is located in the southeastern corner of the Las Vegas Valley within the city of Henderson. An 18-mile radius circle surrounding the facility includes all of Henderson, a portion of southern and eastern Las Vegas, and portions of Boulder City. The area encompassed by the circle contains most types of urban land use, as well as large areas of undeveloped and mountainous terrain.\n\nThe following land use categories and approximate percentages are represented within the 314 square mile circle centered on the Pioneer facility:\n\n* Undeveloped land in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA), about 7% of the total, is located along the eastern and northeastern edges of the circle;\n\n* Undeveloped Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation Land, about 35% of the total, comprises most of the southern half of the circle outside of the Las Vegas Valley and also an area along the eastern part of the circle between Las Vegas Valley and Lake Mead NRA;\n\n* Residential development, about 40% is present over wide areas to the east, west, northwest, and southeast of Pioneer, and includes a small part of Boulder City on the extreme southeast;\n\n* Undeveloped private land, about 6%, is mainly located in the southern and eastern portions of Las Vegas Valley;\n\n* Commercial, retail, and tourist development, about 18% are found in numerous areas throughout Las Vegas Valley, along with a small por"

      "SummaryText": "tion of Boulder City;\n\n* Open space such as parks, golf courses, and greenbelts, about 2%, are located at widely scattered areas within Las Vegas Valley;\n\n* McCarran International Airport, about 1.5%, is located approximately 7 miles west-northwest of the facility; and \n\n* University of Nevada at Las Vegas, 0.5%, is located 8 miles northwest of the facility.\n\nPrevailing winds in the Las Vegas Valley are generally from the southwest during the months of February through September, and from the west during the months of October through January. The prevailing winds average 7-11 miles per hour. In the absence of storms and regional atmospheric circulation patterns, there is a diurnal wind flow. The typical diurnal flow system occurs when cool, dense air in the mountains moves downslope into the valleys during the night, and then reverses to flow upslope during the day as the valley heats up relative to the mountains.\n\n\nRegulated Substances At The Henderson Plant\n\nChlorine is the only chemical at the Henderson Plant that which falls under the RMP regulations. Chlorine is classified by EPA as a Highly Hazardous Material (HHM) thus subject to RMP.\n\nThe Chlorine Process has many safeguards (design features, procedures, and policies) in place to improve process safety. Many of these safeguards relate to (1) preventing releases of hazardous material from the process equipment and (2) limiting the quantity of hazardous material that could be released if any accident occurs.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program NRS 459.30-459.3874, Olin has developed a comprehensive accidental release prevention program based on elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. \n\nEach of the PSM elements is fully implemented and integrated into the facilities standard operating procedures. The elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integri"
