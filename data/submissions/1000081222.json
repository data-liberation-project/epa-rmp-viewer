However, several changes are captured in this update as follows.  Note:  this facility was previously owned and operated by Dow Chemical.  A change of ownership notification was submitted on 03/08/19.\r\n\r\na) 310 Block Operations:\r\n\r\n- Added a unit operation within the 310 Block Operations that handles hydrogen fluoride as a covered process due to interconnectivity.  The 310 Block Operation was already covered due to hydrogen fluoride.  The inclusion of the unit operation did not increase the hydrogen fluoride inventory nor did it change the WCS or ARS.  \r\n\r\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \r\n\r\nb) 640 Block Operations:\r\n\r\n- Updated the worse case scenario for aqueous ammonia.  The updated WCS for aqueous ammonia does not have any off-site impact and does not supersede the current WCS (SO2) for the site.\r\n\r\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \r\n\r\nNote: Unit Operations included in Federal RMP due to interconnectivity rule.

Pittsburg Operations is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at Pittsburg Operations is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Pittsburg Operations has six regulated substances present at the site.  These substances include ammonia (aqueous), ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nPittsburg Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Pittsburg Operations was designed and constructed in accordance with RAGAGEP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nPittsburg Operations maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.  This information is regularly reviewed, as needed, and is readily accessible to plant operation"

Pittsburg Operations also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Pittsburg Operations with additional emergency response capability.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nImproving safety is a continuous process at Pittsburg Operations.  PHA's, Compliance Audits, Technology Reviews, Facility Self-Assessments and Management System Reviews, Incident Investigations, Emergency Response Drills and employee participation are a primary means for identifying opportunities to improve safety.  Structural seismic upgrades, materials of construction upgrades, installing additional process instrumentation and/or process controls, and conducting Hazard Awareness training are typical of currently planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  As another example of Pittsburg Operations' commitment to continuous improvement in safety, the site was CalOSHA Voluntary Protection Plan (VPP) Star certified in 2013 and recertified in 2017.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding process descriptions, Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario impact maps, public receptors, etc., is available at the Pittsburg Operations Site."
