This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for the storage of LP-Gas. It is the policy of this company to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur we would notify the Postville Fire Dept. and request that they would respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled. The facility is a bulk propane terminal consisting of three 30,000-gallon propane tanks for retail and wholesale business. \n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios. Our worst case scenario would be the failure of one 30,000 storage tank filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F) Resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.The resulting distance to the endpoint does extend offsite, and public receptors are within the distance.Our alternative release scenario is a break in a pipe at our bulk plant leading to a 10 minute release and resulting explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offiste, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. The facility complies with EPA's accidnet prevention requirements. This facility also complies with applicable state, federal and local codes.\n\n\nFive Year accident history. This company has never had an incident at his location that has caused deaths, injuries, evacuations, property or environmental damages.\n\n\nThe emergency Response Program. In case of an emergency involving our propanesystem. It is our policy to notify the Postville Fire Dept. It is also our policy to contact the Allamakee County Sherifs Dept.,The Postville Fire Dept. is a trained fire brigade.\n\nPlanned Changes to improve safety. We are implementing a program of regular propane system inspections. We are also facilitaing on-going formal CETP training for ar"
