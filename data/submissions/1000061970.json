Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\n\n\n\nThe Executive Summary is a brief description of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Black Hills Energy (subsidiary of Black Hills Corporation) acquired SourceGas LLC on March 15, 2016. Prior to this date SourceGas owned and operated Rocky Mountain Natural Gas (RMNG). Rocky Mountain Natural Gas is now under the control of Black Hills Energy. A Re-submission (January 2017) is being prepared as it was determined that there are two full-time employees at the facility. This required the development of Process Safety Management Plan and a change program status from a 1 to a 3. \n\n\n\n1.1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nRMNG accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are generally adhered too.  RMNG emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nRMNG spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n1.2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at RMNG Piceance Creek #1 Gas Plant Facility is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas s"

The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane.  These regulated flammable chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n1.3.    Worst Case Release Scenario  (40 CFR 68.165(a))\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is included in the RMP. It includes a worse case scenario for the 30,000 gallon NGL tank and an alternative release scenario for the failure of a vibration switch. \n\n \n\n1.4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(c))\n\n\n\nThe Facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.  This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source.\n\n\n\n1.4.1.    Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nRMNG release prevention program includes a written Emergency Response Plan.  In addition, safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances is maintained at the Facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\n1.5.    Five-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe Facility has not had a reportable accident of covered processes in the five years previous to February 1, 2017.\n\n\n\n1.6.

The Emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  In the event of a covered process accident, first aid procedures, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Action Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the local authorities.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on the site are kept at the Facility.\n\n\n\n1.7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(f)\n\n\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.  SourceGas has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety regarding the covered process when necessary.\n\n"
