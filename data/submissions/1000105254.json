This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such employee participation, maintenance and operating procedures, and training associated with the ammonia refrigeration process at the facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Miami Dade Aviation Department (MDAD) which provides emergency response expertise.  \n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Aero Miami III facility, located on NW 36th adjacent to the Miami International Airport , includes cold storage warehouses that require a refrigeration system that uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant to cool storage areas for tenants to ensure the quality of their stored products. To provide cooling to these areas, the facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in quantities above 10,000 pounds.  The recirculatory vessel and compressors are located within a dedicated machinery room; emergency relief is atmosphere.  Refrigeration piping, condensers, and the thermosyphon receiver is located outside of the building on the roof.  Ammonia detection is provided in air units located in occupied cooled spaces with automatic pump down for units on detection.  \n\n3.\tPrevention Program\nThe facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity (TQ) for OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and the process is therefore subject to PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \nThe Aero Miami III facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA PSM Standard.  It includes a preventive maintenance plan, admini"

      "SummaryText": "stered by a refrigeration contractor, which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This helps to ensure that all equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  \nAdditional components of the prevention program include, but are not limited to, collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), the development of operating procedures, and training.  A Process Hazard Analysis revalidation was performed in April 2023.  \nAdditional procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits and Incident Investigation, also ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives the full support of facility management and involvement of employees and contractors at all levels.  \n\n4.\tFive Year Accident History\nThe Aero Miami III facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that meet the five-year accident history reporting criteria.  \n\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\nThe Aero Miami III has a written emergency action plan for ammonia in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.   Emergency plans are coordinated with local responders.\n  \n6.\tPlans to Improve Safety\nTo improve safety, Aero Miami III has been undergoing a \u0093revamp\u0094 of their existing prevention program and will implement recommendations resulting from the 2023 PHA Revalidation and Compliance Audit."
