This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable release of regulated substances. The number of full time equivalent employees on site is zero, as the facility is vacant and there are no tenants occupying the building. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five years or within six months of process changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. A summary of the results can be located in the Worst Case Scenario section of this RMP submittal. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. A summary of the results can be located in the Alternative Release Scenario section of this RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  It should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event, which furth"

In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of EPA RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia. Prevention Program 3 elements are listed below:\n\n?    Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n?    Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n?    Training (TRN)\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n?    Management of Change (MOC)\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n?    Compliance Audits (CA)\n\n?    Incident Investigation (II)\n\n?    Employee Participation (EP)\n\n?    Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\n?    Contractors (CON)\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no EPA RMP-applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nDuring the May 2014 PHA, a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed. The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, an act of nature (earthquake, thunderstorm, lightning, high winds, snowstorm, tornadoes, aircraft impact, external fire, and human error/mis-operation. The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed by the Process Hazard Analysis. This technical document can be found in the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe facility is included in the wr"

Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the May 2014 PHA Report. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by May 2015.\n\n"
