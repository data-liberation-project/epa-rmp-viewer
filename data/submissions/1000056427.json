The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing.\n\nBlack River Midstream, LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Black River NGPP is located near Loving, New Mexico and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1.    NGL\n\nThe NGLS within the product surge tank can contain the following regulated chemicals:\n\na.    Methane\n\nb.    Ethane\n\nc.    Propane\n\nd.    i-Butane\n\ne.    n-Butane\n\nf.    i-Pentane\n\ng.    n-Pentane\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\nBlack River Midstream encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n\n4. Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\n\nEmployees have access to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\n\nB.

Equipment design basis and configuration information\n\n6. Identification of all necessary Regulatory equipment design documents\n\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM.\n\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheet (SDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBlack River Midstream has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process.

The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\nBlack River Midstream maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nE. Training\n\nBlack River Midstream has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on t"

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\nF. Contractors\n\nBlack River Midstream uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near Covered Process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\n\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazard that they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n1. A process overview\n\n2. Information about safety and health hazards\n\n3. Emergency response plan requirements\n\n4. Safe work practices before beginning work\n\nIn addition, Black River Midstream Management will evaluate the contractor safety program and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nBlack River Midstream conducts a PSSR for any new facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR invo"

Management of Change\n\nBlack River Midstream has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\n\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\nJ. Incident Investigation\n\nBlack River Midstream will promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation will be to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences, and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented and investigation reports will be retained for at least 5 years.\n\nK.
