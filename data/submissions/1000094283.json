In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nBEF Foods is located at 640 Birch Rd., Xenia, Ohio.  We manufacture some of the finest pork products in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Facility produces and ships approximately 25 million pounds of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains 12,511 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nBEF Foods has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved, as necessary.\n\nBEF Foods has organized the infor"

A PSM compliance audit was completed in May of 2014.\n\nBEF Foods also incorporates additional safety items such as tagging of all ammonia system valves and components.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nBEF Foods in Xenia, Oh. is a meat-based processing and distribution facility.  The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBEF Foods had no releases of over 100 pounds in the last 5 years.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Maintenance Manager and Emergency Response Facilitator.  The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe Maintenance Manager determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted. The Maintenance Manager then takes appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given, and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nWe maintain an ammonia detection system as an early warning / automatic remediation tool. Our system detects ammonia concentrations in our engine room or in the relief vent stack and automatically initiates actions to minimize the effects of the release.\n\nWe also perform daily rounds of the ammonia refrigeration system when the facility is in production mode. This allows us to \"double check\" the automatic control system and assures a high level of accuracy.\n\nShould an event occur which would require our team members to evacuate, we are confident that our team c"

Monroe Dr. 45385 in Xenia Ohio will provide medical service to our employees to include contractor employees.\n\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nBEF Foods has considered a variety of scenarios that include mishandled shipping containers, vessel or pump releases, over pressurization, and ruptured transfer hoses. \n\nThe most likely to occur at our Xenia Facility for a worst case would be a Vessel Release (Liquid) and for an alternate release an over pressurization cause a Rupture Disk/Safety Relief Valve to lift venting to atmosphere.  \n\n"
