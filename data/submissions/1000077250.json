One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS # 26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs. In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete containment area. The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model (ver. 5.4.7) and resulted in the area of concern not affecting any public receptors. The nearest other facility is Cooper Lighting, at 466 yards from the rail spur.  However, Cooper lighting is not in the path of prevailing winds.  The release rate calculated by the ALOHA model was 0.168 lbs./min.  The toxic endpoint was also calculated using RMP Comp.  RMP comp gave a much longer distance of 0.4 miles compared to the ALOHA result of 0.02 miles for the red AEGL-3 zone.  We used the longer distance for our worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility relies on local emergency services to respond to all reportable spills or releases.  Spills/releases less than the reportable amount but more than an incidental drip will be cleaned up by a third party.  The currently contracted third parties are Chemtrec and Safety Kleen.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has contracted professional emergency responders as back-up. The facility's Emergency Action Plan, prepared in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q), has been coordinated with the LEPC and the local fire department. All facility employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous subst"

Procedural changes may be implemented in the future if revaluation deems them necessary.  Storage tanks are equipped with over-flow protection and alarms to minimize risk.\n\n"
