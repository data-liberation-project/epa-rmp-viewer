The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Phillips 66 Denver Terminal: \r\n  1.\tEmployee Participation, \r\n  2.\tProcess Safety Information, \r\n  3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA), \r\n  4.\tStandard Operating Procedures,\r\n  5.\tOperator Training, \r\n  6.\tContractors, \r\n  7.\tPre-startup Safety Review, \r\n  8.\tMechanical Integrity,\r\n  9.\tHazardous Work Authorization (Hot Work, etc.), \r\n 10.\tManagement of Change,\r\n 11.\tIncident Investigation, \r\n 12.\tEmergency Procedures/Planning, \r\n 13.\tCompliance Audits, and \r\n 14.\tTrade Secrets\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history. \r\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\r\n  \u00bf\tOnsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \r\n  \u00bf\tOffsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\r\nThe covered process/stationary source started operations in April 2016.

The only covered substance on site above threshold quantities is butane. \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\nThe objectives of this hazard assessment are twofold: (1) satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and (2) provide Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) information that will help local emergency planning officials improve community emergency response in the event of an accidental release at the refinery. Due to the nature of covered substance (butane), OCA focused on potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following: \r\n  \u00bf\tExplosion: Overpressure of 1 Psig \r\n  \u00bf\tRadiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds. \r\n  \u00bf\tLower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources. \r\nThe facility has submitted to the EPA a worst case and alternative release scenario for the regulated substance held in the covered process. The facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs) to show release scenarios that may have a more realistic chance of occurrence. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2021 RMP Resubmission. \r\nSince no changes in inventory of the regulated substance or the operating conditions of the covered process have occurred in the last 5 years, the facility revalidated the Worst-Case and Alternate Scenarios that were modeled for the 2016 submission.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \r\nPhillips 66's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the facility's regulated substance to employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.
