      "SummaryText": "Facility Accidental Release Policy\nThe owners, management and employees of UAP Northwest, 1701 N.W. Main Street, Blackfoot, ID are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity at UAP Northwest is the storage and sale of fertilizers.  For this RMP, a non-hazardous fertilizer is produced from a mobile reactor.  The substance(s) that are occasionally stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshhold level for the RMP.  Anhydrous ammonia is received via rail car and reacted with Phosphoric Acid to produce ammonia polyphosphate fertilizer.  This end product is considered non-hazardous.  This fertilizer is utilized for land application in crop production.  The reactor utilized in this process is not the property of UAP Northwest.  It is a private company that travels with this equipment to various states providing service for retail fertilizer locations.  No employee of UAP Northwest are involved in the processing.  The sole reason the regulated substance is on UAP property is for the purpose of making this non-hazardous end product fertilizer. \n\nWorst-Case and Alternate Release Scenerio\nThe worst-case release scenerio for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 160.000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest rail car at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.18 miles.\nThe alternate worst release scenario based on the five year accident history (or th"

The distance to the end pint (pint of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facilty has developed a written Emergency Contingency Plan.  The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under; OSHA 29 CFR 1910.138, 1910.119 and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR part 264, subpart D, and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - FRP - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements within this plan include employee training.  SARA Title III reporting rquirements and Community Right-To-Know, pre emergency planning and emergency response information.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe users of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility imnplemented the provisions of the \"Safety Reuirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc (ANSI K61.1); California Code of Rgulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nFive-Year Accidental History\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Anhydrous amminia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement continues to be an on-going process at the facility, and by the owners of the reactor.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planed changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia reail cars or processes at the facility."
