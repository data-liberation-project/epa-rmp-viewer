      "SummaryText": "Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nDean Milk Co/Louisville, Kentucky processes milk, milk products and drinks.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, milk products and drinks within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures however is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a condenser, high pressure receiver, recirculator, evaporators/heat exchangers, compressors, piping, and valves.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nDean Milk Co is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its' employees, and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency action to take in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorst case and alternative release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998), EPA \"RMP*COMP\" and the \"International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines\" (1998).  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nAs a part of its PSM Program, Dean Milk Co. has established numerous p"

These programs include:\n\n\n\n-  Process Safety Information\n\n-  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-  Operating Procedures\n\n-  Training\n\n-  Mechanical Integrity\n\n-  Management of Change\n\n-  Pre-Startup Review\n\n-  Compliance Audits\n\n-  Incident Investigations\n\n-  Employee Participation\n\n-  Hot Work Permits\n\n-  Contractor Safety\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Information:\n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency action including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, as well as the public.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 which will notify the Camp Taylor Fire Department, Louisville and Jefferson County LEPC, and the Louisville police department.  LEPC has included Dean Milk Co. in its local emergency operation plan.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nDean Milk Co. has had an excellent record in preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period that had an adverse impact on the community.\n\n\n\nSteps to Improve Safety:\n\nThe facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.  Continued training and program reviews are some of the steps that will be taken to improve safety."
