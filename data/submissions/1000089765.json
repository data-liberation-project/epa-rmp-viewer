Fig Avenue\n\nFresno, CA 93706\n\n(559) 268-5586\n\nFAX (559) 486-6929\n\n\n\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions - Fresno, CA primary business is processing wholesale distribution of meat products for human consumption. The facility operates processes an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures This program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 and the California Process Safety Management Program, CCR Title 8, Section 5189 as enforced by the local Certified Unified Program Agency and the Fed/EPA. In addition 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to Federal RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs at the Main Plant Process the refrigeration system inventory exceeds the threshold.  The West Coast Packer process is under the 10,000 lbs threshold but applicable to CalOSHA and CalARP therefore is documented as a Program 2 in the Federal RMP program. \n\n\n\nThe RMP was resubmitted in September 10, 2020 to meet the five-year anniversary date by which you must next update your RMP.\n\n\n\nFacility release modeling was performed using EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp in addition to ALOHA software and Marplot. The methodologies reported in CDX reflect conservative modeling approaches to meet the endpoint criteria. The both worst-case scenarios are based on the High-Pressure Vessel as that vessel could potentially hold the largest quantity of ammonia. No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenarios. For the worst-case scenarios, smaller quantities handled at higher process temperature or pressure were considered. The report and supporting information contained herein only specify the final select"

Other alternate cases were considered including, overpressure situation from a pressure relief valve, vessel overfilling, over pressurization scenarios, pipe ruptures and material handling and transfer hoses. Alternate release scenarios including shipping container mishandling, breakage, or puncturing that could lead to a spill were not considered because the facility does not handle shipping containers containing anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and prepared a unified program based on PSM to meet CalARP and CalOSHA obligations so that it meshes more closely with general Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation business practices as well.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility has an emergency action plan in place and conducts periodic response drills and coordinates with the local fire department and LEPC. The facility is committed to continually improving safety through program implementation and execution. The facility has not experienced a release incident that meets the EPA's 5 Year Accident Reporting criteria involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental d"

In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The refrigeration system can also be manually shut down via an emergency switch located outside the East and West machinery room in addition to the West Coast Packers machinery room.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation is a commercial beef slaughter house and processing facility. The Main Plant Processing System provides refrigeration capacity to the Kill Floor area, Offal Storage rooms, Chill Coolers and Boning Rooms. The Kill Floor is cooled by two packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units. There are four Carcass Coolers and two Offal Storage rooms that are cooled by ceiling mounted fan coil units. There are five Boning Rooms that are cooled by a combination of three packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units and ceiling mounted fan coil units. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to two liquid recirculators through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves and expansions valves. From there, low pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve and hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils. Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to one of two pumped liquid recirculators located in the engine room. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled e"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. Excess liquid from the liquid recirculator is pumped to a transfer vessel where the liquid transfers into the high pressure receiver by gravity.\n\n\n\nThe West Coast Packers process was built in 2004. This area is served by an ammonia refrigeration system designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time. It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.

The other Chill Coolers the Boning areas were remodels of an existing meat processing facility. This work was done from 2001 to 2004.
