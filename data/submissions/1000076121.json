Carbon fiber textile material is received by the facility where it is prepared for the brake production process. The furnace deck process include densification, heat treatment, and coating. The machine shop process include machining and hardware assembly. \r\n\r\nREGULATED  SUBSTANCES  HANDLED (\u00a72745.3(b)) \r\nMETHYLCHLOROSILANE \r\nThe facility uses Methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) in the brake production process. The facility currently can store up to six full cylinders (approximately 1000 lb. /cylinder) onsite. These cylinders are stored in the site gas feed shelter which has adequate secondary containment. The area is 20'x21'x2' and has an internal barrier such that one section has 31 sq. ft. of surface area and the other has 182 sq. ft. of surface area for containment. There are three process connections where the cylinders are heated to maintain the temperature of the cylinders while MTS is being used in the process. The empty cylinder storage-process area will not contain levels of MTS that are greater than the California or Federal threshold trigger levels. \r\n\r\nPROPANE  COMPRESSED GAS \r\nThe facility uses propane gas as a feedstock material in the production process and is stored in an 18,000 gallon liquid storage tank.  The maximum intended inventory of the storage tank 14,400 gallons (60,480 lbs). The criterion to include Propane Gas (flammable) in the PSM program is a quantity in excess of 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (\u00a72745.3(d)) \r\nThe Goodrich Corporation (Collins Aerospace) facility has not had an accident involving the Methyltrichlorosilane and Propane Gas systems during the past five years, which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or responses or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \r\n\r\nPREVENTION  PROGRAM (\u00a72745.J(c)) \r\nA Risk Management Program"

The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n 1) The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of MTS and Propane Gas, and the design of the system and equipment. This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the two covered processes.\r\n 2) The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance) being actively involved in all elements of the Accidental Release Prevention Program. This program ensures that employees who operate and maintain MTS and Propane Gas systems are knowledgeable in these processes, and can offer invaluable insights on Environmental Health and Safety improvements.\r\n 3) The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the Methyltrichlorosilane and Propane Gas systems using the HAZOP what-if/checklist, or other approved techniques. A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing MTS and propane systems  in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the systems. The PHA addressed: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failures; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures .The PHA resulted in several procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the systems. These recommendations  are targeted for resolution by the end of 2019. The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\r\n 4) Written Standard Operating Proced"

Any deficiency found is corrected.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (\u00a72745.3(e)) \r\nThe Santa Fe Springs Facility has consolidated these requirements into the Consolidated Contingency Plan. The plan covers the regulatory requirements for emergency response training, evacuation procedures, procedures for notifying the public, government agencies, and local emergency response agencies of a release, procedures for the maintenance of emergency response equipment, and emergency management and organization structures. \r\n\r\nThe Consolidated Contingency Plan also contains complete instructions for responding to specific emergencies, including fires, medical emergencies, indoor and outdoor oil spills, flammable materials releases, natural disasters, workplace violence, and bomb threats."

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown. They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\r\n 5) Methyltrichlorosilane and Propane Gas system operators receive refresher training at least annually. The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.\r\n 6) The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to the covered processes.\r\n 7) Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\r\n 8) Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of the covered processes are subjected to a formal investigation. The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\r\n 9) Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, covered processes are pre-qualified based on their knowledge of the systems, understanding of applicable Federal, State and Local codes and standards, written safety and training programs, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\r\n 10) Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have b"
