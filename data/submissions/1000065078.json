Poso Cogeneration plant uses anhydrous ammonia to limit nitrous oxides in the stack emissions as required by their APCD operating permit. Ammonia is a regulated substance under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which requires facilities storing or handling regulated substances in threshold amounts to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and to implement an effective accidental release prevention program. Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company, LLC has a Risk Management Plan and an accidental release prevention program in place meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and Title 19, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention program (CalARP). Ammonia is also a regulated substance under the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard thus requiring Mt. Poso to comply with Cal-OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company is committed to conducting business in a manner that is lawful, compatible with the environment and conducive to the health and safety of employees, contractors, facilities and the community. They will conduct operations in compliance with applicable industry standards, OSHA's PSM Standard, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, and the California Accidental Release Prevention requirements. Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company will conduct business consistent with the EH&S Policy and the following EH&S Principles:\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nActivities will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, industry standards and guidelines.\u000b\r\n\r\nActivities will be managed to protect people and property and to control Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company's liabilities.\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nAll Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company's employees will be individually and collectively accountable for the execution of the EH&S Policy.\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nEH&S goals will be achieved through the prudent use of resources, and throu"

Poso Cogeneration Company has a twelve-year history of operating in compliance with the California Risk Management Prevention Plan (RMPP), California Accidental Release Program (CalARP), and the Cal-OSHA PSM program. Compliance with these accident prevention programs and the company's EH&S principles will continue to ensure an incident free operation.\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nIII. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\u000b\r\n\r\nMt. Poso Cogeneration Company operates a nominally rated 49.9 megawatt, biomass-fired, circulating fluidized bed, cogeneration facility, in Kern County. The Mt. Poso Cogeneration plant began operation in 1989. Mt. Poso operations personnel, under an Operation and Maintenance Agreement, perform the day- to-day operation. Mt. Poso provides steam for enhanced recovery of crude oil.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions from the Mt. Poso exhaust stacks, which improves air quality. The emissions control operations include storage and handling of up to 21,250 gallons of anhydrous ammonia, a substance that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has identified as an acutely hazardous material. The USEPA and California have established complementary programs for reducing the hazards associated with the storage and handling of such hazardous materials. The program was initiated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Title Ill, Section 112(r) and codified in 40 CFR Part 68. The California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) pursuant to Sections 25531 through 25543.3 of the Health and Safety Code has additional regulations. To comply with both state and federal requirements, Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company is required to prepare a joint Risk Management Plan (RMP) and an accidental release prevention program for its anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facilities.\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nThe maximum capacity of the ammonia storage tank is 25,000 gallons.

HAZARD REDUCTION\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted at least every five years at the Mt. Poso facility as required by the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations. The PHA is a systematic review of design, equipment, safety, and operating procedures. In March 2017, a PHA was conducted for the ammonia deNOx process, using the HAZOP and What-if/Checklist Combined methodology. This PHA updated included a review of External Events and Human Factors that could result in a release of ammonia. Engineering controls and mitigation systems in place at Mt. Poso Cogeneration include equipment compatible with anhydrous ammonia, ammonia sensors, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, emergency power, and grounding equipment. Administrative controls include: health, safety and process training for all employees, contractors and visitors; procedures for different aspects of operation and record keeping; proper installation of equipment; regular inspection; ammonia truck off-loading procedures; storage tank/system operation procedures; ammonia injection procedures; and repair and maintenance for all equipment anhydrous ammonia process. Plant personnel supervise the deliver and off-loading of ammonia.\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nV. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\u000b\u000b\r\n\r\nThe PSM/RMP Program has been established by Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company to protect company and contract personnel, the surrounding community, and property by preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia. The program complies with both the Federal/State RMP requirements, and Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR). The program is a comprehensive management program that integrates engineering controls, a"
