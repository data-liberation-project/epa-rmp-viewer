If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n2.\tFacility Information\n* The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, to farmers.\n* Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n* Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in 1 above ground tank(s) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 144,457 pounds.\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\na. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 144,457 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85%capacity as limited by regulations. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.60 miles. The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a 2 inch line. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .80 miles.\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAnhydrous Ammonia: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for St"
