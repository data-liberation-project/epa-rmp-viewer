EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n     Tomah Reserve, inc. is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the  Reserve Plant \n\nworkers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the  Reserve Plant has established a \n\nsystem to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk \n\nmanagement program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the  Reserve Plant and that complies with the \n\nrequirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental \n\nRelease Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of \n\nthe RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the  \n\nReserve Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to \n\nprovide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Reserve Plant.\n\n\n\n1.2     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n     Tomah Reserve is committed to the safety of  the  Reserve Plant workers and the public, and to the \n\npreservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  \n\nThe  Reserve Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. \n\nIn the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to minimize such releases. \n\nThe  Reserve Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and coordinates with the local \n\nemergency planning committee (LEPC), which have established a program to warn the community if an \n\naccident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\n\n\n1.2     The Reserve Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe   Reserve Plant handles  two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be \n\ncovered by the RMP rule:\n\n\n\n?

The OCA consists of \n\nevaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). The  Reserve Plant \n\ndoes not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in \n\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The \n\nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness\n\n     \n\n     Mechanical Integrity\n\n     The  Reserve Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping \n\nsystems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating \n\ncondition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written \n\nprocedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying \n\nquality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical \n\nintegrity of the process equipment.\n\n     \n\n     Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health \n\nhazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe \n\nwork practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help \n\nensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests \n\nare performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within \n\nacceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, \n\nemployees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), o"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a \n\nrecurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops \n\nrecommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Reserve Plant management for \n\nresolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations \n\nare tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, \n\nand the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected \n\nby the findings.
