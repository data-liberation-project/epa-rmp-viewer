      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAtlas Pipeline Mid-Continent LLC owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Velma Gas Processing Plant, in Stephens County, Oklahoma.   The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.  \n\nThe Atlas Pipeline Mid-Continent LLC Velma Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\t\n\nThe Atlas Velma plant is located one mile west of Velma, Oklahoma, on old Highway 7 and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n \n2. Regulated flammable products:\n\na. Methane\nb. Ethane\nc. Propane\nd. Butane\ne. Isobutane\nf. Pentane\ng. Isopentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving  237,000 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in one of two vessels. This flammable mixture would be in a High Pressure or Low Pressure Surge Tank. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and near"

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition  in the operators\u00bf procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nC.Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nVelma Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically exams examines and explores for potential hazards putspotential hazards, then establishes  controls to put in place too manage the potential hazards. The Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists with a team consisting of Velma\u00bfs Atlas employees who have operationsing, and maintenance, engineering and safety experience and  as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified.

Changes are reviewed to:\n\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\nK.Incident Investigation\n\nVelma Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\nL.Compliance Audits\n\nAt least every 3 years a Compliance Audit addressing all OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of Velma Gas Plant.
