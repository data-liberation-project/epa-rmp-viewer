In fact, Mead-Escanaba has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguard against release of a hazardous substance and resultant injuries or damage from such a release.\n\nMead-Escanaba limits the use of hazardous substances.  Prior to using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at Mead-Escanaba, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, as well as the environment and steps are taken to prevent any such effects.\n\nMead-Escanaba prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Mead-Escanaba, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nMead-Escanaba limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Mead-Escanaba trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release should one occur.  In addition, Mead-Escanaba works with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur. \n\nThe safety program at Mead-Escanaba consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Mead-Escanaba that are required by the RMP rule. \n                                                                                                                                                                         1.1     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMead-Escanaba is committed to the safety and health o"

The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Mead-Escanaba does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) although unlikely, is more probable than a worst-case release scenario and (2) could result in a potential off-site consequence.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule requires specific requirements for the worst case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Mead-Escanaba.  These requirements are:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                            One worst case scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 2 or Prog"

As part of this commitment, Mead-Escanaba has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Two components of this system are a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that helps manage the risk and that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; and a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mead-Escanaba.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.    \n\nThe process safety and risk management program at Mead-Escanaba consists of three elements:\n\nA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\nA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\nAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at Mead-Escanaba helps provide assu"

The shift supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  The Hot Work Permits are assigned a number by the Loss Prevention Officer and are monitored until the job is complete.  The Loss Prevention Department retains copies of the completed permits.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit is included in the Mead-Escanaba safe work practices training programs that are conducted on a regular basis.\n\n12.  Contractors.  Mead-Escanaba established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that Mead only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  Mead-Escanaba explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, Mead-Escanaba safe work practices, and emergency response procedures.  Mead requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at Mead before that worker begins work at the Mead site.  Mead-Escanaba periodically reviews contractor-training documents, and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.  \n\n13.  Trade Secrets.  Mead-Escanaba will provide all information necessary to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119 without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.  Mead-Escanaba reserves the right to require confidentiality agreements.\n                                                                                                                                                                            1.4.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps  \n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Mead-Escanaba has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at Mead-Escanaba.

The ammonia vendor supplies ammonia via Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for ammonia developed by Mead-Escanaba.\n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  If release occurs downstream of the regulator at the cylinder, the regulator will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in most areas containing chlorine.  Chlorine is also supplied by DOT approved 90-ton railcars.  A remote camera monitors the chlorine railcars twenty-four hours a day.  A blue flag and derailer protection program is utilized as well.  Employees who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for chlorine developed by Mead-Escanaba.       \n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Mead-Escanaba facility and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a chlorine dioxide solution (1.2 wt%) is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A diked area around the storage tank further reduces the consequen"
