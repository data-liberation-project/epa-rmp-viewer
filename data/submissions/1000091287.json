The facility is located at 501 NE 181st St., North Miami Beach, Florida 33162-1067.  The SIC code for the operation is 2026; the NAICS code is 311511.  The facility has approximately 106 full time plant employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, \n\n52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The refrigeration system inventory at the facility exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History - ?68.155(d)\n\n\n\nThere are no known accidents or releases associated with the ammonia refrigeration system within the past five years which resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, or evacuations, either onsite or off-site.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - ?68.155(a)\n\n\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced "

System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the affected portions of the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - ?68.155(a)\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program - ?68.155(e)\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident evacuation drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place.
