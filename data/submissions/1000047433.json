      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, June 2009, and June 2014. \n\n\n\nRecently, LADWP made significant changes (in June 2014) at the chlorination station, which included the installation of a chlorine dry media scrubber (main scrubber) in place of an existing chlorine wet scrubber. These changes required a revised process hazard analysis for the chlorination station. RMP regulations require the submission of an updated RMP to the regulatory agencies within six months of the significant process change. This Risk Management Plan is the update of the June 2014 RMP.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is not s"

This facility chlorinates well water before being supplied to parts of the San Fernando Valley.  In 2014, when the last RMP was being prepared, the chlorination station consisted of a chlorine storage room, a chlorinator room, an instrument room, and a chlorine dry media mini-scrubber to neutralize any chlorine release from the pressure relief vent installed on the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit. The installation of a dry media chlorine main scrubber (replacement of the existing chlorine wet scrubber) of one-ton capacity was also in progress. This dry media chlorine main scrubber has now been installed and is operational. \n\n\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of six one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station. The facility is designed for four of these chlorine containers to be connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and two others are stored as spares.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.

The chlorine storage room, chlorinator equipment room, and the chlorination electrical room are all at ground level.  The chlorine scrubber room is located below the electrical and equipment rooms with the scrubber discharge passing through the roof of the building near the southeast corner. The manufacturer makes performance claims of a maximum chlorine concentration of 25 ppb on the scrubber discharge under design chlorine loading rates.

The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to vacuum regulator check unit. Chlorine gas under vacuum from the vacuum regulator check unit is fed to one of the four chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  From there, gas then travels under vacuum to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve.\n\n\n\nThe gas header line is equipped with automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves (vacuum regulating valve with check-relief vent), and pressure gauges.  The primary \n\n(gaseous chlorine) bank provides all the chlorine to the station until it is depleted.  The other gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.

The scrubber room is equipped with a Mil-Ram leak sensor, which turns off the room ventilation system at 1.0 ppm.  The outputs from the sensors (0-20 ppm) are monitored by the SCADA system. The values can be read and alarms are generated by the system computer at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) control room.  The computer generates the alarm and immediately posts it on a computer terminal screen located in the LAAFP control room.  Additionally, an audio alarm is initiated to further alert control room personnel.  Acknowledgement of chlorine alarms is done at this terminal.  Furthermore, the detection of a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm on any two of those four sensors causes the Halogen actuators to close the angle valves on the containers.

All incident investigation reports are retained in the LADWP's file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe LADWP is a first responder, its employees respond to chlorine accidental releases.  In the event an accidental release that could result in offsite consequences occurs, external resources, such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department will also be solicited to respond.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the emergency response program, the LADWP has developed and implemented an emergency response"
