Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is a covered facility under the rule because three processes at the Columbus, NE wet mill facility contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  All three of the processes meet Program Level 3 criteria.  The actual components of the required RMP include:\n\n\n\n?    Conduct a hazard assessment (release scenarios)\n\n?    Develop and implement an accident prevention program\n\n?    Develop and implement an emergency response program\n\n?    Development and implementation of a management system organizational structure\n\n?    Submittal of a RMP Plan\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release, and to minimize the consequences of any such release of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nAt ADM, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n?    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n?

The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n \n\n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nADM operates wet corn milling facility in Columbus, Nebraska.  Operations at the site include raw material receiving and storage, corn processing and co-product separation, product storage and shipping.  The primary products are corn sweeteners, cornstarch, and ethanol.  In our processes, we use two toxic chemicals and one flammable material stored in quantities greater than the EPA RMP Threshold Quantity limit.  The EPA has identified that toxic chemicals and flammable materials exceeding Threshold Quantities have the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  The three substances and quantities are identified below.\n\n\n\n    Toxics                      Quantity                                           Threshold Quantity\n\n1.    Sulfur Dioxide        15,230 gal. AST (150,000 lbs. @ 84% Admin. Control)    5,000 lbs.\n\n2.    Chlorine            8,000 lbs.       (4 - 2,000 lb. Cylinders)            2,500 lbs.\n\n            \n\n\n\n    Flammable                       Quantity                                  Threshold Quantity\n\n1.

The vaporized sulfur dioxide is dissolved into the process water and produces a sulfurous acid solution.  The sulfurous acid solution minimizes bacterial growth and prepares corn for further processing.  The process water is recovered and added back into the process in a continuous loop.  Chlorine is used at the cooling towers.  Chlorine is drawn into the water stream from storage cylinders to keep a bacteria-free system.  Natural gasoline is added to ethanol in a blend tank as a denaturant.    The \"denatured et"

Administrative controls, mitigation systems, and preventive measures used at ADM include:\n\n\n\n?

This information identifies the potential hazards and the potential risks they pose.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is an evaluation of the impact of a release of a hazardous substance from a complete failure (catastrophe) of the largest vessel, releasing the entire contents over a ten-minute period under the most stable weather conditions.

The worst release would occur over a 10-minute period and the distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 25 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using the RMP*Comp program for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) as well as Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-99-009). There are no mitigation measures included in this scenario.  Public and environmental receptors in this WCS include:  residences, schools, hospitals, public recreational areas, commercial / industrial areas, national or state parks / forests and officially designated wildlife refuges.  The population was estimated and public receptors were identified using The EPA TRI Facility Siting tool and U.S. Census Data utilizing Marplot 4.2.4.  Environmental receptors were identified using U.S. Geological Survey Quad Maps.  Additional information regarding the WCS is included in the Registration Data Elements.\n\n\n\nThe worse-case flammable release scenario at ADM's Columbus Facility would be a vapor cloud explosion of the natural gasoline following release of the entire tank contents (263,000 lbs.).  The consequence distance to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch is 0.5 miles.  The distance was obtained using RMP*Comp.  There are no mitigation measures included in this scenario.  Public receptors include residences and commercial/industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the exposure distance.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) is the evaluation of the impact of a more likely release of smaller quantities of material.

An alternate flammable scenario has been prepared for natural gasoline.\n\n\n\nThe selected sulfur dioxide scenario involves a release when a valve on the sulfur dioxide transfer line is inadvertently opened due to human error.  Sulfur dioxide is released at a rate of 60 lbs. per minute for 15 minutes (900 lb. release).  The distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 0.4 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using EPA Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-99-009).  Detection equipment, alarm system, excess flow valves, and an on-site Emergency Response Team (ERT) help limit release duration.  Public receptors include residences and commercial/industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the sulfur dioxide ARS exposure distance.\n\n\n\nThe selected ARS for chlorine is described below.  Chlorine could be released at the facility if a one-ton chlorine cylinder valve is sheared off.  The entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 lbs.) could be released at a rate of 350 lbs/min.  The release would occur inside the chlorine building.  Liquid chlorine is released which flashes immediately to vapor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 0.8 miles.  Active mitigation in this scenario includes release sensors and alarms, vacuum system shutdown, the presence of unloading personnel, and on-site ERT personnel and equipment.
