On-site personnel are trained to make minor repairs and to contain small accidental releases.\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Pearl River, treats the water and supplies the water to a portion of JXN Water of Jackson. The plant uses chlorine gas mixed in water with anhydrous ammonia gas to disinfect the water. The chlorine gas is stored in 14 one-ton cylinders. At a given time, 7 of the cylinders are connected on a single header. The ammonia gas is stored in a 10,000-gallon above ground tank with a 2,000 gallon above ground tank used for backup.\nCoordinates for the chemical storage locations at the plants were computed using EPA\u0092s downloadable Marplot tool referenced in Figures 1-1 through 1-4.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA mandates that the Worst-Case Release Scenarios have a release of the entire contents of the largest single container of each regulated substance during a 10-minute period with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an F atmospheric stability class. \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 distances for releases were developed using the EPA\u0092s modeling software ALOHA version 5.4.7 while referencing tables listed in EPA\u0092s \u0093RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\u0094 The population affected by releases was computed using the EPA\u0092s and NOAA\u0092s Marplot 5.1.1 software which contains the year 2010 census data. EPA requires that a circle with a radius equal to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 be used to dete"

EPA does not allow the circle to be modified to compensate for prevailing wind conditions or terrain effects, which would greatly reduce populated areas adversely affected by a release. For a 1-ton release of chlorine gas, the distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 as modeled is 1.72 miles, affecting approximately 10,204 residents, nearby major commercial areas of Jackson and Flowood, MS, the recreational area along the Pearl River, I-55 N, Lakeland Drive, hospitals, The Memorial Stadium, and Leflore\u0092s Bluff State Park. The 10,000-gallon ammonia tanks are limited to being filled to 85% of capacity due to the policy of ammonia suppliers used by JXN Water, reducing the effective capacity of each tank to 8,500 gallons. For an 8,500-gallon release of ammonia gas, the distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 is 2.56 miles, which includes areas in Jackson, Pearl, and Flowood, Mississippi affecting approximately 23,265 residents and nearby schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, major government areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River, Lefleur\u0092s Bluff State Park, The Memorial Stadium, I-55 N, and Lakeland Drive.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs determined by ALOHA an atmospheric stability class of C was used since it matched Jackson\u0092s average weather parameters of temperature (83.7\u00b0F for August), humidity (74%), and wind speed (3.0 m/s). Chlorine gas was modeled as released through a 0.375? diameter hole in the supply piping with a valve that failed to close automatically for 1 cylinder was assumed. This produced a distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 of 1.16 miles, affecting approximately 3,705 residents, nearby major commercial areas of Jackson and Flowood, MS, the recreational area along the Pearl River, I-55 N, Lakeland Drive, hospitals, and Leflore\u0092s Bluff State Park. The release scenario for ammonia storage assumed the release of the contents of the larger storage tank, producing a distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 of 1."

These operators inspect the chlorine and ammonia systems at least twice each shift. The chlorine system has area gas monitors which trigger flashing lights and an audible alarm on the main plant computer in the Operations Room. The ammonia system has an area gas monitor in the Ammoniator Building which triggers a flashing light and an audible alarm in the building. The ammonia system also has high-pressure and low-pressure alarms which produce an audible alarm on the plant computer and a warning light on the plant\u0092s control board. Maintenance personnel are immediately called in to stop small releases. The operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia equipment are performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u0092s instructions. Operations and maintenance personnel receive regular training in the use and maintenance of the equipment through monthly safety meetings, seminars provided by the equipment manufacturers and formal classes provided through the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators Association and other training providers.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, the plant has not had any releases of chlorine or ammonia which resulted in death, injury, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant has developed an emergency response program. Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City of Jackson\u0092s, City of Pearl\u0092s, and City of Flowood\u0092s Fire and Police Departments and Hinds County\u0092s"
