Franksville, WI, is a frozen foods storage facility with modern capabilities.\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia (Cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to cool or freeze product for storage and shipment. The refrigeration system is a closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pump or pressure differential to the freezers, docks, and cooler area evaporators for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to the Recirculator and Intercooler vessels in the engine room. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 120 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 psig. The quantity of ammonia on site, is 10,008 lbs.\nAs part of the PSM program, Central Storage and Warehouse has completed a Process Hazard Analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Central Storage and Warehouse implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Central Storage Warehouse to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Franksville, WI facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Central Storage Warehouse includes the following steps:\n*\tWritten plans for implementing employee participation in PSM.\n*\tProcess Safety Information: Information pertaining t"
