RFAAP is owned by the U.S. Department of the Army, and is currently operated under contract by BAE Systems, Ordnance Systems Inc. effective 1 July 2012. RFAAP has been in continuous operation since 1941. RFAAP maintains an accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, management of change, and employee training associated with the facility's processes. RFAAP maintains 24/7 on-site security and fire services, and coordinates with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee to provide additional emergency response expertise if needed.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances at RFAAP\r\n\r\nThe primary operations at RFAAP are propellant manufacturing processes for both military and commercial purposes. In support of these operations, RFAAP maintains more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances: nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), ethyl ether (60-29-7), ammonia (7664-41-7) and oleum (8014-95-7); therefore, RFAAP is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68). As all of RFAAP's RMP-covered processes directly support, the facility's primary activity is defined under NAICS Code 32592 for Explosives Manufacturing. \r\n\r\nRMP Covered Processes at RFAAP\r\n\r\nThe RMP covered processes at RFAAP as of the October 2020 5-year update are summarized as follows:\r\n-- Ethyl ether in combined storage and manufacturing processes (inclusive of Solvent Recovery, Activated Carbon Recovery System and all associated storage). Despite the geographical areas covered by these processes, these components are considered one single process of interconnected piping and vessels.\r\n-- Ethyl ether in Transient Railcar Storage. \r\n-- Ammonia in Bulk Tanks at the Acid Area and Associated Piping to the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area for use"

Each employee involved in the operation of any process at RFAAP is trained on the applicable Operating Procedures. All training includes emphasis of the specific safety and health hazards associated with the equipment and chemicals involved, as well as emergency operation and safe work practices. Initial training for each operator consists of reading the procedure, and being instructed firsthand on process operations via a walkthrough with the procedure in-hand. Upon any procedure change, each operator is retrained using the same methods as for initial training. The Training Department maintains a database of each employee's required training, including the date of the initial training, the date of the most recent training, and the date that the next refresher training is required.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: RFAAP has established written procedures to ensure the ongoing integrity of process equipment and that employees are trained in conducing these maintenance activities. Additionally, the facility has an overarching Maintenance Plan which documents the Preventative Maintenance and Inspection System. The aspects of this plan satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a1\u00d768.73 for addressing the ongoing mechanical integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. The centralized planning and tracking system of the Preventative Maintenance (PM) system at RFAAP is Maximo, which is an asset management software platform used to track the frequency of PMs and the date that the PM is closed. In the event that a defect is observed during a PM and additional work is required, the defect is noted on the work order, the original PM is closed, and a PM Defect work order is issued to track the corrective action to completion.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Manageme"

Using either endpoint distance value, this process qualifies as a Program 3.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Oleum Storage and Transfer Piping (Acid Area, Legacy C-Line Nitrocellulose Area, D-Nitrocellulose Area): The worst-case release scenario associated with oleum in interconnected storage and piping at the Acid Legacy C-Line Nitrocellulose and D-Line Nitrocellulose Areas assumes that the volume of the largest storage tank at the Acid Area Tank Farm (823,816lbs) is immediately released into secondary containment. The release rate is based on the rate of evaporation from the resulting pool within the dike. EPA's web-based RMP*Comp indicated that the worst case release modeling would yield an endpoint distance of 11.0 miles and impacts to a population of 65,916. Based on a review of the USGS Survey Maps for the area covered by the release, potential public receptors include residential areas, schools, and recreational areas (New River), with the Jefferson National Forest also identified as a potential environmental receptor for this release. However the RMP*Comp endpoint distance of 3.6 miles is substantively higher than that yielded from application of the EPA Guidance Worksheets and Calculations (3.5 miles). Using this latter method results in population impacts of 5,663, and would also result in impacts to residential and recreational areas, schools and environmental receptors. Using either value, this process qualifies as a Program 3.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Anhydrous Ammonia in Storage and Transfer Piping: The worst-case release scenario associated with anhydrous ammonia in storage and piping assumes that the volume of a single storage tank at the Acid Area (170,000 lbs) is immediately released into secondary containment.

Although in this time period, RFAAP did have several acid spills that were reportable to the National Response Center on the basis of exceeding their applicable reportable quantity thresholds, none of these events resulted in either offsite damages to the public or the environment, or onsite injuries, deaths, or significant property damage.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequences Analysis - Worst Case\r\n\r\nAs required by the RMP rule, Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Off-Site Consequences Analysis were developed.  Per EPA's guidance, the intention of these scenarios is to provide a basis for planning and discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions. Of the RMP-covered processes modeled for RFAAP, two (2) processes were addressed as flammable substance scenarios, four (4) were addressed as toxic liquids stored at ambient conditions (oleum and nitric acid), and two (2) were modelled as a toxic gas stored under pressure (anhydrous ammonia). \r\n\r\nDue to the size of the RFAAP facility, a distance of 0.8 mi is required to cause impacts to public receptors at the Army Staff Village area. Worst-Case scenarios were evaluated for all covered processes identified in the 2020 RMP, with addition of the Nitrocellulose D-Line ammonia bulk storage and piping and oleum within NGMA Storage at the Nitroglycerin Manufacturing Area. RFAAP followed EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance in developing the Worst-Case release scenarios, and verified the results via RMP*Comp against the results obtained from the EPA's Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  As required by the guidance, the worst-case release scenarios were modeled using the worst meteorological conditions, which are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F.

The following paragraphs describe the results of the modeling for the worst-case scenario for each RMP-covered process at RFAAP.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Ether Processes: The worst-case release scenario associated with the ethyl ether process group was modeled as a vapor cloud explosion from one of the ether bulk storage tanks containing 296,662 lbs, which is the largest individual vessel in the process. As this is a flammable substance, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud detonation. The endpoint distance resulting from this scenario is 0.5 mi to 1 psi overpressure, which is contained entirely within the facility fenceline and does not result in impacts to the nearest public receptor. Therefore, this process qualifies as a Program 1.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Ether Railcar Storage: The worst-case release scenario associated with the ethyl ether transient railcar storage was modeled as a vapor cloud explosion of a single railcar containing 178,626 lbs. As this is a flammable substance, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud detonation. The endpoint distance resulting from this scenario is 0.4 mi to 1 psi overpressure, which is contained entirely within the facility fenceline and does not result in impacts to the nearest public receptor.  Therefore, this process qualifies as a Program 1.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Nitric Acid Storage and Transfer Piping (Acid Area, Legacy C-Line Nitrocellulose Area, D-Line Nitrocellulose Area): The worst-case release scenario associated with nitric acid in storage and piping assumes that the volume of the largest storage tank at the Acid Area Tank Farm (673"

The Jefferson National Forest was identified as a potential environmental receptor for this release. This process is classified as a Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Oleum in NGMA Storage and Piping at the Nitroglycerin Area: Nitroglycerin Mixed Acid (NGMA) is comprised of a mixture of nitric acid (below RMP threshold concentrations) and oleum.  Although a legacy process to the facility, this process was not historically identified as RMP-covered because the Safety Data Sheets document this material as a nearly 50-50 mixture of nitric and sulfuric. However, because of NGMA's negative water value, the material should be considered as a mixture of nitric acid and oleum instead. The worst-case release scenario associated with oleum in NGMA storage and piping assumes that the volume of the one of the NGMA storage tanks at the Nitroglycerin Area (163,248 lbs) is immediately released into secondary containment. The release rate is based on the rate of evaporation from the resulting pool within the dike. EPA's web-based RMP*Comp indicated that the worst case release modeling would yield an endpoint distance of 3.6 miles and impacts to a population of 6,057. Based on a review of the USGS Survey Maps for the area covered by the release, potential public receptors include residential areas, schools, and recreational areas (New River), with the Jefferson National Forest also identified as a potential environmental receptor for this release. However the RMP*Comp endpoint distance of 3.6 miles is substantively higher than that yielded from application of the EPA Guidance Worksheets and Calculations (1.6 miles).

Using either value, this process qualifies as a Program 3.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Nitric Acid and Oleum Transient Railcar Storage: The worst-case release scenario associated with nitic acid and oleum in transient railcar storage assumes that the volume of the an entire tanker car (189,000 lbs oleum, 185,000 lbs nitric acid) is instantaneously lost to ground and a uniform pool of one centimeter depth is immediately formed. This is the required assumption for the worst-case modeling for this scenario, as the tanker cars are not stored within a secondary containment or impoundment. It is for this reason that although the total volume of the release is larger for the bulk storage tanks of nitric acid and oleum, the endpoint distances are larger for a railcar release since the surface area of the pool is not constrained by a dike.  For a strong nitric acid railcar, the worst case release modeling indicated an endpoint distance of 16.0 miles and impacts to a population of 140,714.  An oleum railcar worst case release would result in an endpoint distance of 12.0 mils and impacts to a population of 78,660. Based on a review of the USGS Survey Ma"

Per the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, alternative scenarios are not required for Program 1 processes. Based on the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.28(a), the minimum alternate release scenario requirements for RFAAP are one scenario each for: (1) ammonia, (2) SNA, and (3) oleum. \r\n\r\nUnlike the worst-case scenario which prescribes consideration of the instantaneous release of the maximum quantity from the largest pipeline or vessel in a process, the alternative release quantity is based on the specific scenario. Therefore, development of the overall quantity as derived from the release rate and duration of release are dependent on the specifics of the alternative release scenario selected. Each individual alternative release scenario was evaluated to determine what level of mitigation is considered credible and appropriate based on the specifics of the each scenario. RFAAP considered multiple potential scenarios for each regulated substance, and subjected them to sensitivity analysis for emergency response planning purposes.  To facilitate this exercise, RFAAP utilized RMP*Comp for the modeling, in consultation with the guidance presented in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.

This failure mode was considered appropriate for this analysis due to being more credible for use in disaster planning purposes for the facility, and less duplicative than modeling a tank failure which was already evaluated under the worst-case scenario analysis. Administrative controls prevent filling of the ammonia tanks to greater than 80% of capacity, which is equivalent to a liquid height of approximately 85 inches above the tank bottom. As sensitivity analysis indicated that this scenario is completely insensitive to the duration used in the modeling, a duration of 10 minutes was selected. Only active mitigation is considered for this scenario based on the activation of the Halo water curtain system within the tank location. An effectiveness of 50% for the Halo system was assumed, although a range of effectiveness was also assessed through sensitivity analysis in order to provide a reference for use in emergency planning and response. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for ammonia indicated an endpoint distance of 0.6 miles based on RMP*Comp.

Acid transfers occur even at night, and although the two area's operators are in communication every 30 minutes, especially a partial loss of the transfer volume would not be likely identified and responded by the operators until after a period of time had elapsed. Therefore, release durations ranging from 15 up to 60 minutes were considered via sensitivity analysis, which is the average time-to-completion for a nitric acid transfer between the Nitrocellulose and Acid Areas; an event duration of 45 minutes was selected for this scenario. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for nitric acid indicated an endpoint distance of 1.1 miles based on RMP*Comp, and a population impacted by this release is estimated at 50. The size of the public population impacted by this release is estimated at 50 based upon the maximum capacity of Staff Village, as a 1.1 mile endpoint distance is not within offsite residential receptors. No schools, recreational areas, or environmental receptors are identified for this release.\r\n\r\nOleum Alternate Release Scenario: The previous 2015 RMP alternate release scenario for oleum utilized the catastrophic release event on 1 July 2012 at the Legacy C-Line Nitrocellulose Area acid storage tank battery.

An alternate scenario was considered for oleum involving development of an erosion/corrosion hole 40% from the bottom one of oleum bulk storage tanks in the Acid Area. As the majority of erosive/corrosive failures occur at the vapor-liquid interface, selecting a release point 40% from the bottom of the tank would also be a reasonable location exposed during the usage cycles between refilling. The release was considered to be mitigated by the secondary containment dike at the oleum and sulfuric acid tank component of the Acid Area Tank Farm. Comparative sensitivity analysis was applied to a range of release durations ranging from to up to 90 minutes, and multiple degrees of tank corrosive damage (ranging from a \u00a8u-D pinhole leak to a 6-D area of tank compromise); all of these possibilities are considered plausible as an initial pinhole compromise can rapidly evolve to a larger damaged area due to the corrosion characteristics of strong acids. The selected scenario utilized a 4-D hole in the compromised tank surface and a release duration of 60 minutes, and resulted in an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles. The closest residential receptor would be the Army Staff Village (population of 50 at maximum), which is located 0.8 miles from the release location.
