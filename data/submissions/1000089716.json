      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP) is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located in Radford, Virginia. RFAAP is owned by the U.S. Department of the Army, and is currently operated under contract by BAE Systems, Ordnance Systems Inc. effective 1 July 2012. RFAAP has been in continuous operation since 1941. RFAAP maintains an accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, management of change, and employee training associated with the facility's processes. RFAAP maintains 24/7 on-site security and fire services, and coordinates with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee to provide additional emergency response expertise if needed.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances at RFAAP\n\n\n\nThe primary operations at RFAAP are propellant manufacturing processes for both military and commercial purposes. In support of these operations, RFAAP maintains more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances: nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), ethyl ether (60-29-7), ammonia (7664-41-7) and oleum (8014-95-7); therefore, RFAAP is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68). As all of RFAAP's RMP-covered processes directly support, the facility's primary activity is defined under NAICS Code 32592 for Explosives Manufacturing. \n\n\n\nRMP Covered Processes at RFAAP\n\n\n\nThe RMP covered processes at RFAAP as of the October 2020 5-year update are summarized as follows:\n\n-- Ethyl ether in combined storage and manufacturing processes (inclusive of Solvent Recovery, Activated Carbon Recovery System and all associated storage). Despite the geographical areas covered by these processes, these components are considered one single process of interconnected piping and vessels.\n\n-- Ethyl ether in Transient Railcar Storage. \n\n-- Ammonia in Bulk Tanks at the Acid Area and Associated Piping to the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area for use "

These are considered one single RMP-covered process of interconnected piping and vessels.\n\n--Nitric Acid and Oleum in Transient Railcar Storage. \n\n--Oleum in NGMA Tankage and Piping at the Nitroglycerin Area for use in the manufacturing process.\n\n--Oleum in bulk storage at the Acid Area and satellite tankage at both the C-Line and D-Line Nitrocellulose Areas, and all associated transfer piping. These are considered one single RMP-covered process of interconnected piping and vessels.\n\n\n\nOnce completion of the extended commissioning and prove-out period process for the new D-Line Nitrocellulose Area is completed, the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area will be permanently shutdown.  At this time, the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area components will be removed from the oleum and nitric acid RMP processes for the consolidated Acid and Nitrocellulose Areas tankage and piping process.  Additionally, the ammonia RMP-process for Acid Area tankage and piping supportive of the C-Line SCR system will also be removed.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history was evaluated for this 2020 RMP update. For documentation purposes, RFAAP's onsite version of its RMP document summarizes and evaluates all release events associated with each covered process, regardless of severity (i.e., inclusive of minor leaks contained entirely within secondary containment and with no personnel exposure). On an ongoing basis in order to identify the occurrence of any events that trigger the RMP update requirements to EPA, all incidents of safety and environmental significant must be promptly reported to management and each incident investigated. \n\n\n\nDuring the 2015-2020 5-year accident history period covered by"

      "SummaryText": " this current RMP update to EPA, no qualifying events were identified for any of RFAAP's covered processes. Although in this time period, RFAAP did have several acid spills that were reportable to the National Response Center on the basis of exceeding their applicable reportable quantity thresholds, none of these events resulted in either offsite damages to the public or the environment, or onsite injuries, deaths, or significant property damage.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequences Analysis - Worst Case\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Off-Site Consequences Analysis were developed.  Per EPA's guidance, the intention of these scenarios is to provide a basis for planning and discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions. Of the RMP-covered processes modeled for RFAAP, two (2) processes were addressed as flammable substance scenarios, four (4) were addressed as toxic liquids stored at ambient conditions (oleum and nitric acid), and two (2) were modelled as a toxic gas stored under pressure (anhydrous ammonia). \n\n\n\nDue to the size of the RFAAP facility, a distance of 0.8 mi is required to cause impacts to public receptors at the Army Staff Village area. Worst-Case scenarios were evaluated for all covered processes identified in the 2020 RMP, with addition of the Nitrocellulose D-Line ammonia bulk storage and piping and oleum within NGMA Storage at the Nitroglycerin Manufacturing Area. RFAAP followed EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance in developing the Worst-Case release scenarios, and verified the results via RMP*Comp against the results obtained from the EPA's Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  As required by the guidance, the worst-case release scenarios were modeled using the worst meteorological conditions, which are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F.

EPA's web-based RMP*Comp indicated that the worst case release modeling would yield an endpoint distance of 3.8 miles and impacts to a population of 6,877.

This is the required assumption for the worst-case modeling for this scenario, as the tanker cars are not stored within a secondary containment or impoundment. It is for this reason that although the total volume of the release is larger for the bulk storage tanks of nitric acid and oleum, the endpoint distances are larger for a railcar release since the surface area of the pool is not constrained by a dike.  For a strong nitric acid railcar, the worst case release modeling indicated an endpoint distance of 16.0 miles and impacts to a population of 140,714.  An oleum railcar worst case release would result in an endpoint distance of 12.0 mils and impacts to a population of 78,660. Based on a review of the USGS Survey Ma"

Therefore, development of the overall quantity as derived from the release rate and duration of release are dependent on the specifics of the alternative release scenario selected. Each individual alternative release scenario was evaluated to determine what level of mitigation is considered credible and appropriate based on the specifics of the each scenario. RFAAP considered multiple potential scenarios for each regulated substance, and subjected them to sensitivity analysis for emergency response planning purposes.  To facilitate this exercise, RFAAP utilized RMP*Comp for the modeling, in consultation with the guidance presented in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.

This failure mode was considered appropriate for this analysis due to being more credible for use in disaster planning purposes for the facility, and less duplicative than modeling a tank failure which was already evaluated under the worst-case scenario analysis. Administrative controls prevent filling of the ammonia tanks to greater than 80% of capacity, which is equivalent to a liquid height of approximately 85 inches above the tank bottom. As sensitivity analysis indicated that this scenario is completely insensitive to the duration used in the modeling, a duration of 10 minutes was selected. Only active mitigation is considered for this scenario based on the activation of the Halo water curtain system within the tank location. An effectiveness of 50% for the Halo system was assumed, although a range of effectiveness was also assessed through sensitivity analysis in order to provide a reference for use in emergency planning and response. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for ammonia indicated an endpoint distance of 0.6 miles based on RMP*Comp.

Acid transfers occur even at night, and although the two area's operators are in communication every 30 minutes, especially a partial loss of the transfer volume would not be likely identified and responded by the operators until after a period of time had elapsed. Therefore, release durations ranging from 15 up to 60 minutes were considered via sensitivity analysis, which is the average time-to-completion for a nitric acid transfer between the Nitrocellulose and Acid Areas; an event duration of 45 minutes was selected for this scenario. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for nitric acid indicated an endpoint distance of 1.1 miles based on RMP*Comp, and a population impacted by this release is estimated at 50. The size of the public population impacted by this release is estimated at 50 based upon the maximum capacity of Staff Village, as a 1.1 mile endpoint distance is not within offsite residential receptors.

An alternate scenario was considered for oleum involving development of an erosion/corrosion hole 40% from the bottom one of oleum bulk storage tanks in the Acid Area. As the majority of erosive/corrosive failures occur at the vapor-liquid interface, selecting a release point 40% from the bottom of the tank would also be a reasonable location exposed during the usage cycles between refilling. The release was considered to be mitigated by the secondary containment dike at the oleum and sulfuric acid tank component of the Acid Area Tank Farm. Comparative sensitivity analysis was applied to a range of release durations ranging from to up to 90 minutes, and multiple degrees of tank corrosive damage (ranging from a ?u\"-D pinhole leak to a 6\"-D area of tank compromise); all of these possibilities are considered plausible as an initial pinhole compromise can rapidly evolve to a larger damaged area due to the corrosion characteristics of strong acids. The selected scenario utilized a 4\"-D hole in the compromised tank surface and a release duration of 60 minutes, and resulted in an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.
