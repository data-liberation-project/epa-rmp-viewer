Accidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polocies:\n\nThe owner/manager  and his employees of Shore Fertilizer Corporation, Belle Haven, VA are committed to the prevention of any accidential release of ammonia from Aqua Ammonia.  If any accidential release should occur at this facility, personnel have been instructed and are prepared to work with the Local  hazmat Team personnel, the Painter Vol. Fire Dept, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe primary activity at Shore Fertilizer Corporation is blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users, (Farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received in by   tanker trucks, stored, and used form the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.  \n\nThe maximum quanity of Aqua Ammonia stored at this facility would be 1,827,560 pounds in 8 tanks holding 23,000 gallons each, and 3 tanks holding 20,000 gallons each.  This would be 547,600 pounds of the maximum of 30% Ammonia content.\n\n3.  The Worse-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:\n\na.)  The  Worse-Case release scenario and the Alternate case scenario would be  the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia from the 23,000 gallon storage tank released as a liquid over a period of  ten minutes.  The maximum amount released would be 172,270 pounds of Aqua Ammonia at 30% maximum Ammonia content.  The distance to end point of 200 PPM of Ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis, is 1.78 miles.  The release would affect 340 residents, a small community recreational facility and several small commercial operations.  The possiblity of this worse-case release occurring is extremely unlikey as location personned regularlarly inspect and repair, as necessary, all storage tanks and equipment.\n\nb.)

This is 370 feet and would affect 85 residents.  The possibility of this Alternate release scenario occurring is unlikely as Shore Fertilizer personnel  periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedure.\n\n4.  The General Accidential Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe facility of Shore Fertilizer Corporation at Belle Haven. VA has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia suppliers recommendation for safe handling of Aqua ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in the handling, storage, and use of Aqua Ammonia is conducted with personnel at this location.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.
