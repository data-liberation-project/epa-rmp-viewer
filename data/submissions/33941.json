This program is fully described in Section 12 of the Risk Management Program and is titled Emergency Response Plan. \nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with National\u00bfs emergency response procedures, National will submit copies of the Emergency Response Plan for review and approval by the following local agencies:\n\u00bf\tChehalis Fire Department.\n\u00bf\tLewis County LEPC.\n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, National\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan includes procedures to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned by police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems.\nContinuous Efforts to  Improve Safety\nAs a result of National's initial process hazard analyses and as part of National's continuous efforts to improve the performance of its safety systems, several changes are planned at the facility to improve safety and prevent anhydrous ammonia releases.  \n\u00bf\tOngoing communication with Lewis County LEPC, Chehalis Fire Department, on our Emergency Response Plan.

      "SummaryText": "NATIONAL FROZEN FOODS CORPORATION\nCHEHALIS, WASHINGTON\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBackground Data\nUnder Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act, and in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68), promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Frozen Foods Corporation (National) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their State Street facility in Chehalis, Washington.  National\u00bfs operations include the processing, freezing, and packaging of vegetables such as corn, and carrots for public consumption.  National has been in operation at this facility since 1927, providing quality frozen vegetables and over 315 jobs to the local community.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nNational is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is National\u00bfs policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA\u00bfs Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\nNational is subject to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  National is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  National uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous"

      "SummaryText": "ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for refrigeration facilities.  National\u00bfs refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, can contain a maximum amount of 43,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at certain times during the process season; normally working capacity is far less than this amount.\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, National has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  National\u00bfs worst case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single high pressure receiver (9,000 pounds) when filled to 100% capacity over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is .9 miles.\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, National maintains the receivers at 50 to 60% capacity.  During pump-down operations, the receivers have the potential to be filled to a greater capacity, approaching the management threshold of 70%, or occasionally higher.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode 10% of the time during the year.  As a conservative approach to the worst-case release scenario, the rupture of a full (9,000 pounds) receiver was analyzed.\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by National taking into consideration their long history of operation\u00bfs experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that National's plant hazards are identified and minimized.  These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).

To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, National has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures (SOPs), preventive maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.\nNational has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs and electrical distribution system grounding).\nNational has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.
