Leonard Rush owns one and Larry Rush owns one and are placed on the same tract of land.  They share a common liquid pump and associated piping.  The storage tanks are filled when the owner(s) are satisfied with current market price of anhydrous ammonia, thus the storage tanks may not be full at all times.   There are also 9 nurse tanks, 5 owned by Leonard and 4 owned by Larry that may not necessarily be located at the facility.  Leonard Rush's residence is located approximately 400 yards from the facility.  There are no additional receptors within the endpoint radius.\n   The owners of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire departments, Doniphan County LEPC, and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n   The facility is in compliance with the provisions of U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the Kansas Fertilizer Law as administered by the Kansas State Board of Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility.\n\nEmergency Action Plan:\n   The facility has:\n   a.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n   b.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III( EPCRA);\n   c.  If a large rele"

Also, the sheriff's office notifies the LEPC who in turn notifies the state.\n        2.  Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release exceeds 100 lbs, the facility will notify\n             The National Emergency Response Center @ 1-800-424-8802\n        3.  By telephone to KS Dept of Agriculture at (785) 296-4835 within 72 hours and in writing within 5 working days.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n      Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
