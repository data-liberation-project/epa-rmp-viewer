Farmers Cooperative Company owns this fertilizer facility, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Readlyn Fire Departmnent (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Bremer County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\n While we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards asociated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Readlyn, Iowa location is Bruce Buxton, general manager.  His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.  In additoin, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n                       Bruce Buxton, general manager\n                       WORK:           (319) 279-3396\n                       24-Hour:         (319) 352-5899\n                       Cell Phone:     (319) 240-4261\n\n                       Roger Buhr, location manager"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facilty is distributed to agricultrual crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize that anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe storage tank consists of one (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a sesonal basis (Spring and Fall).  At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year).  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATVIE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP * Computer Program, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. There are schools, residence, public recreational areas, and businesses within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 957. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to the EPA's RMP * Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nSince this facilty is located in relatively close proximity to the city of Readlyn, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons.  An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRRAM AND CH"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1 1995 and State law.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nFarmers Cooperative Company has never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involing our anhydrous ammonia tank, it is our policy to notify the Readlyn Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. They would in turn call the Hazmat Team in Waterloo. We have discussed this policy with the fire department. Members of the fire department have inspected our anhydrous ammonia tank and the surrounding area. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  In addition, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship performs regular yearly inspections of this facility. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous amonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction and written tests.  It is our policy to replace all safety relief valves, fittings, and hoses in accordance with the law. Maintenanc"
