      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics-Chattanooga, TN\n\n\n\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics Company (AdTech Ceramics) is an ISO9001:2008 and AS9100D manufacturer of multilayer co-fired ceramics electronic packages.  Processes revolve around 50 plus years of experience in material science, engineering, design, tooling and manufacturing of multilayer ceramics.  AdTech Ceramics provides High Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (HTCC), Ceramic Feedthroughs, Multi Layer Aluminum Nitride (AlN), Chemical Metal Milling, and Injection Molded Ceramics to the military, aerospace, medical, energy, and other high reliability applications industries.\n\n\n\nSystem Overview\n\n\n\nAdTech Ceramics has a process by which anhydrous ammonia is \"dissociated\", or broken down, into its elemental components, nitrogen and hydrogen.  Saturated anhydrous ammonia vapor is piped to dissociator units that heat the ammonia vapor to 1750?F, thereby facilitating separation of the NH3 molecule into its component parts, nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases.  This dissociated ammonia (DA) gas is used as process gas for firing kilns and furnaces in a controlled reducing atmosphere free of oxidation.  Anhydrous ammonia is supplied by tanker truck through a liquid filled connection.   Emergency shut-off valves are provided at both the liquid fill and vapor return lines to allow quick shut-off of liquid and vapor flow in the event of an accidental pull-away of a truck or hose rupture.  Ammonia is stored in a liquid state in equilibrium with its vapor at saturation conditions in a pressurized vessel.  The vessel is maintained at approximately 125 psig by an electric vaporizer controlled by pressure switches modulating the heat input to the ammonia vaporizer.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage Vessel\n\n\n\nAmmonia storage includes a 12,000-gallon stationary, horizontal, cylindrical pressure vessel for storing liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  The storage vessel is sized to provide approximately 90 days of continuous supply of diss"

      "SummaryText": "ociated ammonia gas before requiring refilling.  The vessel is mechanically rated for a maximum allowable working pressure of 250 psig at 125?F.  The ammonia storage vessel temperature is monitored through a local indicator.  The liquid level in the vessel is monitored through a local gauge as well as an electronic telemetry unit.  An alert system including an audible alarm is installed for leak detection and out-of-tolerance pressure conditions.  The ammonia tank pressure is indicated through a local gauge.  The tank is equipped with two (2) sets of dual pressure relief valves set at 250 psig atop 3-way valves; excess flow valves at all fluid flow nozzles; and thermal relief valves set at 350 psig on associated liquid ammonia lines.\n\n\n\nAmmonia  Dissociators\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia vapor is piped from the top of the storage tank at 125 psig and is reduced to 40 psig to provide constant pressure feed to the dissociator vessels.  At each of the three (3) dissociator vessels the NH3 vapor is again reduced to 12 psig for introduction into the pre-heater.  NH3 vapor is then piped into the catalyst chamber and heated to approximately 1750?F.  The dissociated ammonia gas (DA) is then piped into the plant for use in the kilns and furnaces as process gas. Atop each dissociator vessel piping is a Kunkle pressure relief valve set at 15 psig.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdTech Ceramics has diligently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release.  The facility has not had an accident in the past five years involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently implemented for the ammonia process. Futhermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and re"

AdTech Ceramics will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business.  AdTech utilizes a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to provide guidelines for preventing and/or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  In general terms, the RMP protects the health and safety of environment and the community, and the PSM program protects the on-site employees.\n\n\n\nItems that are addressed in the RMP/PSM:\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been developed to address a broad spectrum of emergency scenarios and contingent responses.  \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis of worst case and an alternative case release scenarios where air dispersion models and release parameters are evaluated to determine off-site impacts and affected populations. \n\n\n\nA management system is in place to implement and manage the RMP/PSM procedures.  The qualified person is responsible for coordinating with and keeping local authorities informed of changes that affect the RMP/PSM as part of Tier II Emergency Response Information.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management program provides a safe and healthful work environment for the facility employees and contractors by performing a process hazard analysis.
