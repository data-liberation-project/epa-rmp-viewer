The facilities construction was completed in the summer of 2002, it is known as Cloverleaf of Massillon.  The refrigeration engine room, which contains 5 compressors ranging in size  up  to a 400-horse power,  is located at the South- East end of the facility. This engine room also contains all of the ammonia holding vessels except for one vessel, which is located outside of the building structure.\n\nA refrigeration engineer operates the ammonia refrigeration system. The system comprises of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps,heat exchangers and condensers. The ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are high and low pressure automated shutdown systems and high level automated shutdown systems. The majority of these high level alarms are re-enforced with backup alarm devices. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.  Equipment and operating parameters are monitored throughout the day and parameters are logged for comparison to indicate potential problems.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to evacuate the facility and allow the Stark county Hazmat Team to intervene and bring the situation under control with assistance from Cloverleafs refrigeration personnel.   This plan has been discussed with the responding Fire Department and Hazmat Team members.  \n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed could release 10,300 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  This vessel normally contains a maximum 3,200 pounds of ammonia but if the makeup valve stuck open it could contain 10,300 pounds of ammonia before the high-level system shutdown would occur.

The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario of 10,300 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia being released over a 10-minute time frame would be a .6 - mile radius around the facility.\n\nAlternate-Scenario. - The scenario chosen for the alternate scenario is one of a pipe being broken clear through and to have a wide-open, undeformed, open end.  The pipe size is a 3/4-inch schedule 80 type, with an operating pressure of 57psig.  The release rate from a pipe fracture of this type would be 860 pounds per minute.  Calculations for release time duration of 2 through 30 minutes showed the toxic end point to be no greater than a .3 mile radius around the facility."
