This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations, industry standards and practices, internal process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of company and industry experience.  Examples of specific resource material are: the Process Safety Booklets, the BP Engineering Technical Practices, the Whiting Site Technical Practices, the BP Refining Defined Practices, and the Corporate Engineering Specifications.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery processes ~ 430,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), chemical feedstocks, etc.  The refinery has twenty processes that contain materials above the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the regulation.  Of these processes, nine qualify for Program 1 coverage and eleven qualify for Program 3 coverage.   Nineteen of the twenty covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The flammable mixtures typically contain various regulated substances such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  Two of the twenty covered processes contain regulated toxic mixtures of hydrogen sulfide that are above the threshold quantity of 10,000 poun"

The BP Whiting Refinery has performed these calculations using the hazard assessment tools provided by the U.S. EPA.  Flammable scenarios, both worst-case and alternate scenarios, were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and toxicity release scenarios, both worst-case and alternate scenarios, were analyzed using ALOHA&reg; Hazard  Hazard Mapping Software.  The BP Whiting Refinery employs many layers of safety to reduce risk and to prevent chemical accidents.\n\n\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for flammable substances, as required by the RMP regulation, is a vapor cloud explosion with an overpressure endpoint of one pound per square inch.  The worst case scenario endpoint is based on the instantaneous release, vaporization, and vapor cloud explosion of the entire contents of the largest vessel in a process filled to capacity.  This event is highly unlikely to occur.  Although numerous controls to prevent such releases are in place, no credit for administrative controls, passive mitigation systems, safety systems, or personnel intervention can be taken into account in developing the worst case scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP regulation requires that each facility develop and submit at least one worst case scenario for flammable chemicals on site to represent all Program Level 3 processes.  Additional scenarios must be reported if they can potentially impact a part of the community not impacted by other worst case scenarios.  Due to the large geographic area covered by the BP Whiting Refinery, there are a total of five flammable worst case scenarios to represent all Program Level 3 processes.  All Program Level 1 processes were included to demonstrate they do not have offsite i"

Under this scenario, the release is isolated by operators within ten minutes.  In evaluating the alternative release scenario, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation systems.  The maximum distance to the one psi endpoint reaches  beyond the refinery fenceline and extends into an industrial site.  This release scenario was selected based on  best engineering judgement and is therefore a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n\nToxic Worst Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic substances, as required by the RMP regulation, is a release over a ten minute period of the largest toxic inventory held within a single vessel or piping section.  This event is highly unlikely to occur.  Although numerous controls to prevent such releases are in place, no credit for administrative controls, passive mitigation systems, safety systems, or personnel intervention can be taken into account when developing the worst case scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP regulation requires that each facility develop and submit at least one worst case scenario for toxic chemicals on site to represent all Program Level 3 processes.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In particular, employees are involved in accident investigations, writing procedures, training other operators, and the work permitting process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the BP Whiting Refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include standing teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help ma"

Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique as the basis for these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the PHA team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking is used by the facility to prioritize the implementation of mitigation measures.  Mitigation action items are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nTo help verify that the process controls continue to be appropriate to address process hazards, the BP Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the process hazard analyses.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the BP Whiting Refinery has Safe Operating Limits for its covered process equipment that identifies safe upper and lower limits and provides guidance on how to respond to exceedances of those limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Whiting Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator or salary trainer to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce generally during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities and to perform unique tasks.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place that require contractors to: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) to have information concerning the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety site rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the BP Whiting Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and provides the quality assurance that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery has well-established "

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:  (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices so that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures enable work to be performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.\n\n\n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to assure the safe operation of the equipment.  In the latter case, corrective measures are implemented in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help operations and maintenance activities be performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions outside the original equipment design range), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to verify that: (1) adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The Management of Change system requires that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe BP Whiting Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
