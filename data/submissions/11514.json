      "SummaryText": "Excelda Manufacturing is committed to providing a safe workplace for its employees and the surrounding public.  The facility is located in a somewhat rural area of Brighton, Michigan.  The latitude/longitude section is correct according to the RMP suggested internet programs, but the RMP submit program is not accepting them.  I have entered the numbers the program calculated, and I think the problem is our location is so close to Oakland County that  the computer recognizes us as Oakland County.  The function of the facility is blending of specialty chemicals.  Excelda Manufacturing has provided a site plan of the building and copies of material safety data sheets to the local fire department, LEPC and SERC and they are also kept on site for review and easy access.  In March 1999, Excelda provided the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) report to the local fire department, the Livingston County Emergency Planning Committee and the State Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\nThe facility is set up with filling lines and warehousing of raw materials for filling the products.  A very small area of the warehouse contains racking systems containing pallet quantities of finished automotive service parts for distribution.  This facility is being reported as a separate stationary source from the other facility across the driveway, since there are seperate street addresses and seperate functions at both facility's.  However, both buildings have the same owner, and the number of full time employees inhabit both buildings.  The employees at this facility are primarily production workers making product daily packaging it and shipping it across the street to our warehouse facility. However, we have a few finished good products in storage at this facility that we ship out by truck load at this building  The products on site requiring this report are consumer sized aerosol  specialty chemical products.  The largest container on site is 10 ounces (.65 pounds) and "

      "SummaryText": "the maximum amount we would ever have on site is 48,000 pounds. We do not have this much on site at this time, nor do we expect to ever have this much on site, but we are predicting worse case according to the rules of this report.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on the release of our largest vessel, using the guidance supplied by the Chemical Distributors Reference Tables and Equations.  The largest vessel is 10 ounces or .65 pounds.   15% of the product weight is the regulated substance.  Therefore the distance to the endpoint will be 19 feet (.003 miles).  In the report, I had to use the figure of .01 since I am given only 2 significant digits to work with and therefore this information is different from that section.  This distance will stay within the walls of the facility.  This type of release is unlikely to occur since this part of the building is only storage and distribution and none of the activities in the warehouse require a flame to be present and smoking is prohibited. \n\nSince our process qualifies for program 1 of the RMP, I could not enter an alternative release scenario in the report section.  However, if this facility is on fire, all products inside will be affected, not just one single vessel.  The distance to the endpoint using the vapor cloud explosion scenario and the endpoint of 1PSI based on the maximum release of the regulated substance will be 815 feet (.15 miles).   This will affect some commercial, office and industrial areas, and possibly the state park and recreation area.  As I mentioned earlier, this is not likely to occur since the activities of the warehouse are only storage and distribution.\n\nAccidental release prevention programs at Excelda include the OSHA Hazard Communication and Right to Know training.  Emergency Action Plan training and recently updated plan sent to officials and ongoing employee training.  Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act reporting to the local and state agency's.  Inventory con"

      "SummaryText": "trol is also part of our release prevention program, as associates check for damaged goods they are pulled from inventory and reworked to avoid any type of hazard or accident with the products as they are being moved and shipped.  Excelda is also in the process of building a new facility with a seperate storage room for aerosols only with blast walls, fire rated doors and sprinkling requirements for aerosol storage rooms in warehouses.  Once finished, all aerosol products will be stored at this facility only and obviously, a new RMP submitted. \n\nExcelda has not had any accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nExcelda Maunfaucturing has coordinated the RMP with the LEPC and we have also provided information through the EPCRA reports we sent in March 1999.  We have a Pollution Incident Prevention Plan in place for this facility which has the appropriate contacts we need to make in case of a release.  \n\nExcelda is going to continue to provide training to the associates throughout the year and this training will include but not be limited to:  Fire Extinguisher hands on training and evacuation refresher training and Right to Know annual refresher training."
