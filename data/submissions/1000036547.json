In\r\nAugust of 1995, Bozzuto's completed construction of a state of the art warehouse distribution center. Among\r\nits advantages, this distribution center utilizes the benefits of ammonia as a refrigerant. Bozzuto's does\r\nrecognize ammonia as a hazardous chemical, and this was a consideration when selecting the\r\nrefrigerant for the facility. In consideration of the risks associated with the use of ammonia, Bozzuto's\r\ncommits its efforts to ensuring the employees and surrounding community continue to enjoy a healthy and\r\nsafe environment.\r\nPart of this commitment includes:\r\n- Employing only skilled refrigeration technicians;\r\n- Contracting with only experienced ammonia refrigeration contractors;\r\n- Coordination with the Cheshire Fire Department;\r\n- Partnering with a hazardous materials release contractor; and\r\n- Maintaining communication with the Cheshire Town Manager, the designated Local Emergency Planning\r\nCommission (LEPC).\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention is the approach Bozzuto's has taken to minimize and possibly eliminate the\r\npotential for an accidental release. Bozzuto's exercises ongoing preventive maintenance and equipment\r\nintegrity procedures. Some of these programs include:\r\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\r\n- Hazard Communication, and\r\n- Lockout / Tagout.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nBozzuto's maintains twenty-four hour, seven day per week coverage of trained Security Officers. If the event of an emergency the notifier will dial an emergency extension and be connected to a Security Officer. The Security Officer will gather the information and initiate the Emergency Response Plan.\r\nHaving this continuous coverage reduces the response time in an emerg"

Accidental release prevention programs include:\r\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\r\n- Hazard Communication, and\r\n- Lockout / Tagout.\r\n\r\nThrough a Process Hazard Analysis, Bozzuto's uses a hazard and operability study to identify potential\r\naccidental release conditions. Solutions are then developed to prevent or limit these conditions from\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\nIf an incident were to happen, an investigation would take place, and new procedures would be implemented\r\nso a similar occurrence could be prevented.\r\n\r\nBozzuto's prevention programs are audited at regular intervals to validate their effectiveness; the\r\nobjective is to be proactive in preventing accidental releases, not reactive.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBozzuto's is proud of the fact there have been no accidents related to an ammonia release since startup in\r\n1995. With the current practice of education, preventive maintenance, and commitment, Bozzuto's strives to\r\nminimize the potential for any accidents in the future.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Bozzuto's facility has an emergency action plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is\r\ndetailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to\r\nmeet the following objectives:\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe EAP provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health\r\nhazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency\r\nsituations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan\r\nwas reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facilit"

The intention of the\r\npartnership is to provide Bozzuto's additional specific expertise in the field of hazardous materials release\r\nprocedures and prevention. Continuing discussions and exercises are planned to ensure an efficient and\r\nprompt response time.\r\n\r\nBozzuto's is working with the regional New Haven Area Special Hazards Team to pre plan and coordinate\r\nresponse scenarios.\r\n\r\nBozzuto's plans to continue its efforts and commitment to health and safety."
