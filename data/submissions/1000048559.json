      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Thief River Falls Water Treatment Plant (TRF WTP) is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program specified under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 in conjunction with the use of chlorine at the facility for water disinfection.  In addition, the TRF WTP is subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program. In recognition of the noted overlap in various EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program requirements, a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan (PSM/RMP) has been developed to maintain compliance with the components of both programs.\n\nThrough the development of the PSM/RMP Plan, the TRF WTP staff has completed a comprehensive review of the risk associated with the regulated process, water chlorination, at its facility.  Additionally, the TRF WTP has completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis and has developed and implemented a prevention program to promote safe operation of the regulated process.  The facility has also updated emergency response procedures and initiated communication with local authorities to form a cooperative response procedure for potential releases from the facility.  The prevention program focuses on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards associated with the regulated chemical and processes.\n\nBackground\n\nThe TRF WTP retains two (2), one (1) ton chlorine containers, for a combined storage total of 4,000 pounds onsite for water disinfection.  The use and/or storage of chlorine, which is classified as a hazardous chemical under federal standards, at the TRF WTP causes the facility to be subject to federal requirements related to the protection of public health and safety, as well as worker safety.  The EPA Risk Management Program specifies a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds for "

      "SummaryText": "RMP regulation, while the OSHA Process Safety Management Program specifies a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds of chlorine.  \n\nChlorine containers are stored in the chlorine room, which is located in the southeast corner of the facility, and is equipped with a ventilation system.  The chlorine room and its components are visually inspected at least once per day during operation.  When the system is not in operation, the chlorination system equipment and all related process valves are disabled.  The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.  Chlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Its boiling point is -29.4&#61616;F.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials.  Contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits by displacing air.  One (1) ton chlorine containers are welded steel tanks with removable steel protective caps over the container valves.  They are built to meet Federal specifications, and are regularly inspected and pressure tested in accordance with Federal regulations.\n\nManagement System\n\nA management system which assigns responsibility for each component of the PSM/RMP has been instituted.  This procedure will also be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in responsibilities at the facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the PSM/RMP Plan was developed to comply with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements.  The TRF RMP staff has studied their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite.  The results of this analysis are presented in Section 3.0 - Hazard Assessment, and include an Offsite Consequence Analysis, which is composed of a Worst Case and Alternative (most likely) Case Scenario, and an Accident Hi"

      "SummaryText": "story.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAlthough the EPA acknowledges that the Worst Case Scenario is not a likely scenario, a scenario was formulated to alert the public to the worst release possible.  The Worst Case Scenario for this facility involves the release of 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine (the entire contents of one (1) container) directly into the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  Due to the location of the facility in an urban setting, the analysis estimated that a release of this magnitude would create a radius of influence of 1.3 miles.  The radius of influence represents the distance the chlorine plume would travel from the facility, under assumed meteorological conditions, before the concentration is reduced below the \"toxic endpoint\".  The EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance states the toxic endpoint concentration \"is that below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  A population of approximately 8,039, including most of the City of Thief River Falls, resides within the 1.3 mile radius of influence.  The EPA requires that the radius of influence be calculated considering a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, or 3.4 miles per hour.  Historically, the average wind speed in the vicinity of Marshall is approximately 19 miles per hour; thus, a release would likely disperse at a faster rate than estimated under the assumed conditions.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario\n\nAn alternative, or most likely scenario, was also developed as part of the plan.  This scenario involves a release occurring inside the chlorine room.  The TRF WTP utilizes a vacuum-operated chlorination system.  The vacuum system is, for all practical purposes, virtually fail-safe.  A pressure regulating valve is installed directly onto the chlorine container, between the container "

      "SummaryText": "and the chlorinator.  For this valve to open, a vacuum must be present on the chlorinator side of the valve.  The vacuum is created by water passing through the ejector on the chlorinator.  When a vacuum is present and the valve is open, gaseous chlorine may be drawn from the container, through the valve, into the chlorinator, and then injected into the water.  In the absence of a vacuum on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve closes and chlorine cannot escape through the valve on the container.  In the event of equipment failure on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve is designed to immediately close due to the absence of a vacuum.  Because the regulating valve is attached directly to the chlorine container, the most likely potential escape route for chlorine gas from the container is between the valve stem on the container and the pressure-regulating valve.\n\nThe Alternative Case Scenario modeled for this facility involves a leak from the lead gasket between the regulating valve and the chlorine container.  Each time a new container is connected to the system, a new gasket is installed.  Although the gasket is checked for leaks immediately after installation, the Alternate Case Scenario assumes a small leak is not detected prior to shutdown of the system at the end of the day.  The leak continues throughout the night and the entire contents of the vessel are released over a period of 540 minutes (9 hours).  Because the vessel is inside the building with the door closed, the room acts as a passive mitigation measure and contains the release.  The radius of influence for this release is 0.1 miles, which includes a commercial business building and a second floor apartment located adjacent to the TRF WTP, and an assumed population of one.  In addition, the Red Lake River is located within 0.1 mile radius of influence.  In recognition of this potential release, the TRF WTP will integrate Risk Management Program training with its existing training program"

The TRF WTP management is committed to ongoing employee training to increase awareness of the potential hazards associated with the chlorination process and to further reduce the likelihood of future accidents which may result in injury and equipment or property damage.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program portion of the RMP/PSM Plan was developed to comply with the EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program requirements.   The intent of the Prevention Program is to document procedures within the facility that promote safe operation of the regulated process and reduce the potential for an uncontrolled release of the regulated substance (chlorine gas).

Similarly, any hot work to be completed must be authorized with a hot work permit.   \n\nFinally, per a Process Safety Management Program requirement, TRF WTP reserves the right to require employees and/or other designated representatives to enter into confidentiality agreements not to disclose trade secret information contained in the RMP/PSM Plan.  Correspondingly, employees and/or other designated representatives will be allowed access to any trade secret information that may be provided in these safety documents.  \n\nEmergency Response\n\nAlthough the potential for a release exists, the TRF WTP has determined that the chlorination system is safe by industry standards and that the potential for a release from the facility is very small.  The facility is working with local authorities to prepare emergency responders in the event of a major release.  TRF WTP staff are trained to respond to releases than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The TRF WTP will work with the Pennington County Emergency Manager to coordinate response to a release.  A contact checklist is utilized to ensure the proper contacts are made in the case of an emergency, including at the local (fire department, county emergency planning, etc.), state, and federal levels, as necessary.
