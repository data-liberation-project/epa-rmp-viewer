A primary aspect of this commitment is the EP Pine Bluff system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, EP Pine Bluff will implement procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  EP Pine Bluff\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  A safety & health manager has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the original preparation of this plan and policies.\nTo effectively implement these policies, EP Pine Bluff established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental, Health and Safety to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n2.0  EP Pine Bluff and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Evergreen Packaging Pine Bluff Mill, located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of high quality coated bleached paperboard.  To manufacture our products, EP Pine Bluff utilizes one regulated substance, chlorine dioxide, that is covered by the RMP Rule.  The chlorine dioxide used at EP Pine Bluff, is generated on site, immediately absorbed into water, and then stored in a 0.9% solution.  The RMP Rule exempts regulated toxic subst"

However, EP Pine Bluff has elected to pursue development of a RMP Plan for chlorine dioxide consistent with the requirements of the General Duty Clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\nThe regulated use of chlorine dioxide at EP Pine Bluff is as follows:\n\nTable 1.  Summary of ClO2 storage tanks.\nProcess\nDescription\tProgram Level\tRegulated\nSubstance\tMaximum Process\nQuantity\nChlorine Dioxide System\t3\tChlorine dioxide\t45,160 lb\n \n3.0  Hazard Assessment\n\nEP Pine Bluff performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of an accidental release of chlorine dioxide from our process.  Chlorine dioxide was evaluated for possible worse case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  It is important to understand that EP Pine Bluff has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, EP Pine Bluff has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \u00c2\u00bfPrevention Program\u00c2\u00bf section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected because of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program (Program 3)\n\nEP Pine Bluff's Chlorine Dioxide System and other processes at the facility are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.

The Prevention Program for the Chlorine Dioxide System is well developed and was in place prior to the implementation of the RMP Rule.\nThe Chlorine Dioxide System Prevention Program consists of the following twelve elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nEP Pine Bluff maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tphysical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tchemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n\u00c2\u00bf\toperating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tdesign basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n\u00c2\u00bf\tspecific chemical inventories.\n\nEP Pine Bluff ensures that the process safety information is available to all mill employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The safety & health manager is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine dioxide and other chemicals used in our processes.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\nEP Pine Bluff also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tmaterials of construction,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tdesign pressures,\n\u00c2\u00bf\ttemperature ratings,\n\u00c2\u00bf\telectrical ratings,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tflow limits,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tblock flow diagrams,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tconsequences of deviation from operating limits,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tsafety systems,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tapp"

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to aid in the safe and proper operation of the process.  These documents are used to:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\ttrain employees,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tperform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n\u00c2\u00bf\thelp maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorine Dioxide System are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nEP Pine Bluff performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Chlorine Dioxide System to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Chlorine Dioxide System is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, EP Pine Bluff primarily uses the HAZOP technique, supplemented with checklists.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorine Dioxide System operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the Manager of Pulp and is tra"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorine Dioxide System is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the Manager of Pulp for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nEP Pine Bluff engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorine Dioxide System operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tunit startup,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tnormal operations,\n\u00c2\u00bf\ttemporary operations,\n\u00c2\u00bf\temergency shutdown,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tnormal shutdown, and\n\u00c2\u00bf\tinitial startup of a new process.\n\nThe written operating procedures include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tsteps for safely conducting process tasks,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tapplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations, and\n\u00c2\u00bf\tsafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and action(s) to take in the event of an exposure to a hazardous substance.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nEP Pine Bluff trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.
