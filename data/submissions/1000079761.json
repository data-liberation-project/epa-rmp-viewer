Written general maintenance procedures are contained in the HSSE procedures manual and are reviewed on a periodic basis by technical staff. These procedures outline the maintenance organization, and work flow and address specific maintenance functions. Maintenance on non-pressure equipment is performed in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer's instructions or industry best practices. Maintenance on non-pressure equipment may be contracted by the Maintenance Supervisor to service companies that specialize in maintenance of specific equipment.

The SRA includes data gathering and analysis to assess security risks and to determine the need for upgrading countermeasures in support of the Shell security risk management program. The assessment was performed using the Shell Standard Risk Assessment Methodology. The Shell SRA methodology is consistent with the most current guidance available via API 780 Standard for SRA.

Regular red tag or field simulation drills are conducted in the field to test operational response. \r\nA periodic emergency drill is also conducted by SMR in conjunction with various outside agencies. As appropriate, SMR, MCP, and/or the applicable emergency response agencies work together to resolve any deficiencies identified during the drill. This pre-planning activity ensures that the members of the responding agencies are familiar with SMR/MCP facilities, the hazards of various extremely hazardous materials, the resources available at SMR/MCP, and their location. It also clearly identifies the capabilities and limitations of each responding agency. Copies of the drill records, including recommendations and critiques, are maintained at SMR and/or MCP.\r\n \r\nMCP will also work closely with CCCHSD regarding any necessary response to hazardous material releases, to assist in determining requirements for downwind air monitoring, and to alert the public of the accidental release of EDA or aqueous ammonia.

No accidental releases of EPA or Cal-ARP regulated substances (e.g., EDA) were identified that met these criteria.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nOverall safety at MCP is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases. MCP has implemented an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases on employees, the public, and the environment. MCP's emergency response program is covered under contract with the broader emergency action plan/emergency response plan (EAP/ERP) administered by the Shell Martinez Refinery (SMR).

The Concord and Green Valley faults have a potential to create most of the earthquake concern for the site. The Green Valley-Concord fault has a 16 percent probability of one or more greater-than-6.7-magnitude earthquakes between 2014 and 2043, and the Rodgers' Creek-Hayward fault has a 33 percent probability of one or more greater-than-6.7-magnitude earthquakes between 2014 and 2043, These faults, particularly the Concord fault, create most of the earthquake concern at the Martinez Site.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ABAG (Associated Bay Area Government) Liquefaction Susceptibility Map, the potential for liquefaction at MCP is very low. The ground surface at the MCP includes soils that have been disrupted, modified, removed, built over, or filled with crushed rock or other material resistant to weathering, such as blacktop (asphaltic compounds), concrete, or compacted gravel, sand, silt and clay. Soil conditions are considered to be alternating layers of claystone, siltstone, and sandstone varying from dense to very dense. Based on this information, the Site Coefficient is S1. Finally, based on the geology of MCP, the potential for landslide or settlement is minimal.\r\n\r\nCounty guidelines were followed during the seismic assessment of the EDA storage tanks, the EDA charge pump, associated piping system and the Solution Preparation vessel. These are the only pieces of equipment within the EO Catalyst Process that contain EDA. The objective of the seismic assessment was to provide reasonable assurance that loss of primary containment of EDA would not occur as the result of a major earthquake.

The most recent Ethylene Oxide PHA team included an outside contracted PHA Facilitator, Technical Manager and Operations Support Engineer, Process Operators, HSSE Manager, USW Health & Safety Representative, Control Systems Engineer, Production Manager, Senior Environmental Advisor, and Shell Catalyst Process Safety Manager. The team considers the causes and consequences of these deviations to identify hazardous conditions and their consequences, lists existing safeguards, and makes recommendations for changes where appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe team identified and evaluated hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and made suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation action as necessary. The HAZOP was documented and finalized on worksheets containing a description of each process node and its design intent, a list of possible deviations, causes of deviations, consequences, safeguards, and required action items/investigations/questions for further study. These potential deviations were risk-ranked using the Shell Risk Assessment Matrix or RAM. Any identified action items are formally tracked using the Action Item Database and resolved through the MCP HSSE-MS. OSHA guidance is followed regarding issue resolution. A similar team conducts the revalidation of the PHAs every five years. PHAs are also updated, as necessary, in conjunction with the RMP updates.

The EO Catalyst Process produces a silver-based catalyst sold to industrial customers that convert hydrocarbons to ethylene oxide. A specially formulated impregnating solution is produced at MCP and absorbed onto carrier pellets to make the EO Catalyst products. \r\n\r\nThe RM-17 product is manufactured by reacting a proprietary raw material (containing toluene as a carrier) with a heavy olefin in the presence of a liquid catalyst. A series of simple distillation steps removes the lighter boiling components (including the toluene). The purified product is then shipped to other Shell Chemical facilities for further use in the process of manufacturing detergent products.\r\n\r\nPlease note that for the purposes of this RMP document, accidental release scenarios have only been determined for RMP regulated substances (e.g., ethylene diamine used on the EO Catalyst Process).

MCP is committed to be a responsible member of the Martinez and greater Contra Costa County communities. We place a high priority on operating our facility in a safe, healthful, and environmentally sound manner.\r\n\r\nShell requirements dictate that their facilities continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, evaluate risk, and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of process design, engineering controls, and safe work practices and procedures. This commitment to healthy, safe, secure and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Shell HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and the Environment) Commitment and Policy. The MCP Risk Management Program (RMP) is incorporated into this HSSE Commitment and Policy through the MCP Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Management System or HSSE-MS. Specific Plant RMP-related action items are identified, evaluated, resourced, and checked via an internal action tracking tool. These documents, as well as other related materials are readily available to all workers.\r\n\r\nMCP stresses safe, healthful, secure, and environmentally sound operations via an annual employee training program, various safety meeting and, the Plant HSSE Committee. MCP has a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) and Administrative Procedures Manual that comprehensively covers various aspects of management systems conformance. Each employee and field contractor at MCP also receive a Basic HSSE Requirements Handbook. Shell also maintains internal HSSE Audit and Management Review programs under its HSSE-MS. Plant, Corporate, and Contract Personnel conduct internal audits at various time intervals (weekly to once every 3-5 years). Management reviews occur continually throughout"
