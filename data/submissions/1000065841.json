      "SummaryText": "Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals, LLC (KMST) - Knoxville Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System, including two 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels, one truck offloading location, five (5) railcar offloading locations (as well as room for 14 railcars on standby). The Butane Blending System was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and is maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of KMST - Knoxville Terminal to adhere to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the City of Knoxville Fire Department and the City of Knoxville-Knox County Emergency Management Agency.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department and/or responders annually t minimum.  The City of Knoxville Fire Department personnel have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services and University of Tennessee Medical Center which is the nearest full service hospital/emergency department.\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe Knoxville Butane Blending System has been evaluated for a worst-case and alternative release scenario in accordance with the parameters described in the Risk Management "

Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \n\n\n\nKMST - Knoxville Terminal actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the City of Knoxville Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n"
