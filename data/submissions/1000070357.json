Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\nCobra Oil and Gas Corporation (Cobra) is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment at the West Branch Production Gathering & Compressor Station (WBCS). This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, and operation and maintenance of the natural gas processing equipment. Cobra's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nII. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe natural gas processing that occurs at the WBCS, is located near the City of West Branch, Ogemaw County, Michigan, and operates as an automated unmanned facility with processes to remove hydrocarbon liquids from sweet natural gas. The plant has a single regulated flammable liquid mixture of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which contains ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. The facility has no regulated toxic substances. The natural gas processing and NGL storage equipment at the WBCS is a Program Level-2 facility.\r\n\r\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nBecause portions of the WBCS is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68) for a Program Level-2 facility, this summary addresses the RMP elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\r\n\r\n- Safety Information: The WBCS keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process. These documents address hazards associated with the regulated hazardous chemicals at the facility, the process technology, and process equipment and are updated as necessary\r\n\r\n- Hazard Review: Within the program, the regulated process is systematically examined as necessary to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls"

      "SummaryText": "are in place to manage these hazards.  Hazard reviews are conducted when new equipment or processes are introduced to the facility and revalidated as required.\r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures: The WBCS has written operating procedures, implemented those procedures, and properly trained all appropriate personnel. The WBCS uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training to assure the work they are doing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety of the company, personnel, and the general public.\r\n\r\n- Training: To complement the written procedures for process operations, the WBCS has implemented and has recently updated a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating the process. The program is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process.\r\n\r\n- Maintenance: The WBPGCS has developed a written maintenance program that includes the regulated process equipment that incorporates procedures and tracking which has been implemented.  The maintenance activities are conducted by knowledgeable and experienced individuals and all appropriate employees have received proper training.\r\n\r\n- Compliance Audits:   To ensure the WBPGCS facility stays in compliance with the RMP requirements, an appropriate audit schedule will be implemented from the initial startup date for the regulated process.  From this initial date, the facility must conduct a compliance audit within three years and every three years thereafter.  In addition, the facilities management team ensures that day-to-day operations, maintenance, and administrative activities are performed consistent with the intended RMP regulations.  \r\n\r\n- Incident Investigation: The WBCS has had no incidents. However, an Incident Investigation procedure is in place in the event it will need to be used. The processes at the WBCS have haz"

The WBCS has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The WBCS uses release detection systems such as gas detectors, and release mitigation measures such as dikes to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\nIV. Five-year Accident History\r\nPrior to this initial startup of this natural gas processing the WBCS has been in operation for many years with an excellent record of accident prevention. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\r\n\r\nV. Emergency Response Information:\r\nThe WBCS is not required to have an emergency response program because employees will not respond to releases. The facility has coordinated regularly with the Ogemaw Fire Department IN West Branch to respond safely to releases. However, the facility has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such as: communication procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, response to a fire or explosion, severe weather response, environmental spill response, or pipe line failure. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modifications made to the facility process or operating procedures, or changes in the communication procedures.\r\n\r\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe WBCS will conduct hazard reviews, safety audits, training, and accident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety."
