Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\n\tThe Romulus Plant, as part of the Woodbridge Group of\ncompanies, believes the health and safety of its employees and\nthe protection of the natural environment, should be of the\nutmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are\ncommitted to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a\nsafe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n\n\n\t* Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards. \n\n\t* Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making\nhealth, safety & \t\t\tenvironmental improvements.\n\n\n\n\tOur complete Health, Safety & Environmental policy statement,\nsigned by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our\nfacility.\n\n\n\n\tWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency\nresponse planning, which are described later in this document,\nto help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as\nwell as protection of the environment.  Our Plant Manager has\noverall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates\nin a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes\noverseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk\nmanagement program.  To ensure that our risk management program\nis appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager\nhas assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with\nthe background, training, and experience necessary to manage the\nprogram.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority\ndelegated directly from the Plant Manager, is responsible for\ncoordinating the development, implementation and integration of\nthe RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP\nrule.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\n\tThe primary purpose of the Romulus Plant is to produce\npolyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry. \nThe foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals\nimmediately prior to pou"

Upon exiting the oven, the foam\npads are removed from the mold, crushed, trimmed and prepared\nfor shipment to customers.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is\nregulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the\nreactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is\nreceived at the plant by tanker truck.  It is stored in 2 tanks\nlocated in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is\nthen transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled\nsystem.\n\n\n\n\tAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility\nemployees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum\namount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 200,000\npounds.\n\n3. Off-site consequence analysis scenarios\n\n\n\n\tEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the\nworst-case release and alternative release scenario's for our\nfacility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios,\nincluding information about the key administrative controls and\nmitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each\nscenario.\n\n\tThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic\nendpoint as established by the RMP rule was a technique\ndescribed in EPA's OCA Guidelines.  In particular, equation D-1\nof that guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation\nrates based upon information published by the National Institute\nof Standards.  A table using this technique was developed and\nthe specific distances extrapolated from that table. \nMeteorological conditions of 1.5 mph and 96 degrees F at 72%\nrelative humidity were used.  An urban environment was assumed\ndue to the characteristics of the local terrain.  The Aloha\ndisperson model was also used as a verification of the tabular\ndata.  \n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:  \n\n\tCatastrophic failure of a TDI storage tank full of TDI inside\nthe building, discharging its entire contents of"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n\tAt this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety\nmanagement systems.  We also anticipate improving our training\nprograms in the area of specific maintenance tasks.

There is containment in the tank\nfarm which would form a pool of 2378 square feet with a max\ndepth of 7 feet.  The distance to the endpoint concentration of\n0.007 mg/l is 102 feet.  This distance is less than the distance\nto the nearest public receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: \n\n\tAlthough, the worst-case Scenario results, and the five year\naccident history, put this process as a program one, a second\nscenario involving a hose rupture during a tanker truck off-load\nwas also completed.  Again, the distance was less than 102 feet\n(worst case) and therefore less than teh distance to the nearest\npublic receptors.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the\nspecific prevention steps.\n\n\n\n\tWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing\naccidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for\nour TDI process address each of the key features of successful\nprevention programs including:  \n\n\n\nContractor use\n\nHot work permits\n\nSafety information\n\nHazard reviews of our processes\n\nOperating procedures\n\nTraining\n\nEquipment Maintenance Program \n\nAccident/Incident Investigation\n\nInventory Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work\ntogether to prevent accidental chemical releases.
