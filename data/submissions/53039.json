To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.   \n1.\tDELANO FARMS COMPANY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delano Farms Company has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nDelano Farms Company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Delano Farms Company business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n2.\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Delano Farms Company facility is a commercial cold storage for table grapes.  The facility has two (2) ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  The rooms are equipped with \u00bfbunker style\u00bf and ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nThe systems operate as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the"

      "SummaryText": "suction accumulators, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the suction accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.     \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 \u00bfStandard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\u00bf.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency control box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nBoth of the ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated at one process.\n3.\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n3.1 General.\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of any one of the regulated chemicals in"

      "SummaryText": "annual pre-season safety meetings.  These employees are made aware of the potential risks of the process chemicals involved.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nDelano Farms Company has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for each process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analysees are reported in the body of the program.\n3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia.\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Delano Farms Company facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.   The north ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 47,000 lbs and the south ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 12,000 lbs. It is extremely important that these processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.  These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our ammonia equipment.\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nDelano Farms Company has had no accidental releases within the last five (5) years. \n5.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \u00bfEmergency Action Plans.\u00bf  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u00bf and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStra"

All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an hazardous chemical release. \n6.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Delano Farms Company continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  The overhaul of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Delano Farms Company business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operators have assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Delano Farms Company now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00bfliving document\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Delano Farms Compan"
