We are dedicated to protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors as well as the environment at our site and in our community.  Our goal is always zero incidents.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Clariant Louisville West Plant manufactures customized precipitated catalysts and catalyst\n\ncarriers. They are used in various industries to aid in the manufacture of other products.  They set in motion a desired chemical reaction or process using much less energy than otherwise needed and minimizes the output of waste and greenhouse gases.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the use of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a chemical regulated by the EPA. Titanium tetrachloride is used by plastic resin manufacturers to more efficiently make polypropylene which is used to makes plastics that go into many useful consumer products, including car bumpers, bicycles, medical devices and toys.  The process is comprised of interconnected units including the tank farm and production process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nClariant takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous\n\nchemicals.  We used multiple layers of protection to avoid hazards, with each layer adding additional layers of safety.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful process safety programs including:\n\nEmployee participation: Employees are highly trained.  Control room operators constantly monitor the systems and respond quickly.\n\nProcess safety information: Complete and accurate informatio"

Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Clariant Louisville West Plant is introducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) for the first time and, therefore, has not had an accidental release of titanium tetrachloride in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nClariant maintains an emergency response plan which addresses all of the various federal, state,\n\nand local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the\n\nessential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment\n\nduring emergency situations. Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of titanium tetrachloride, our only RMP chemical on site.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAt Clariant, we are committed to continuous improvement of environment, health, and safety\n\nperformance. Through our Process Safety Management program, we review hazards associated\n\nwith our processes and implement actions to reduce the hazards according to risk assessment/risk management principles.\n\n\n\nClariant is dedicated to protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors as well as the environment at our site and in our community.
