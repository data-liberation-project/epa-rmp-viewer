O'Laughlin Municipal Water Plant, located at 5815 Buffalo Avenue, Niagara Falls, New York, is a municipal drinking water treatment plant and we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and the Citys' Emergency Response Plan to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\n\nOur facility uses Chlorine as a disinfectant in water treatment. The chlorine is bought in one ton cylinders and stored in our chlorine building. The building is equipped with a scrubber to neutralize any inside releases.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nChlorine - one ton cylinders - maximum on site is 15\n\nFlammables\n\n None\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals. Worst-case Release Scenario(s)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nBreaking of a Chlorine cylinder while being unloaded from a delivery truck. This would allow for 2000 pounds of chlorine to be released in approximately 10 minutes. The estimated exposure distance would be about 4.5 miles. Contained within this estimated distance are many residences, schools, and businesses. Employees are trained to mitigate this exposure by only moving one cylinder at a time.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nFailure of a fusible plug on a chlorine cylinder. This would result in a release of about 2000 pounds of chlorine in 2 hours. The estimated exposure distance would be less than .4 miles. There are several residences located within this area. Employees are trained"
