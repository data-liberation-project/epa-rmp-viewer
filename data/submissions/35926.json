      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWe at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Lafayette South are strongly committed to employee,public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of sweeteners and corn syrups utilizing the corn wet milling process. We have two regulated substances at our facility. These substances are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). Chlorine is used in two different processes: chlorine controls microbial growth in a cooling tower and chlorine disinfects well water for potable use. Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used to control microbial growth during the corn steeping process and also weakens the starch-gluten bonds so the separation process following steeping is more efficient.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 89,000 lb. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8,000 lb. at the well field and 8,000 lb. at the cooling tower.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate release scenarios we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, \"Pampflet 162: Generic Risk Management Plan for Chlorine Packaging Plants and Sodium Hypochlorite Facilities\" prepared by the Chlorine Institute and the EPA's RMP Comp computer software. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves catastrophic releases from the Sulfur Dioxide tank. In this scenario 89,000 lb of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is released as "

At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography the maximum distance of 10 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nTHE SULFUR DIOXIDE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves a break of the 1/2\" transfer line between a Sulfur Dioxide truck and the bulk Sulfur Dioxide tank. The scenario involves a release of 11,250 lb of Sulfur Dioxide as a gas liquified by pressure. The existing controls prevent bulk tank losses. The operator and the truck driver monitoring the truck unloading will require 30 minutes to stop the release. The The toxic gas liquified under pressure will be released to the atmosphere with no passive mitigation to control the release rate. Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and assuming urban topography the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur Dioxide is 0.4 miles.\n\nBOTH CHLORINE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS involve a failure of the 5/16 inch liquid valve on the Chlorine cylinder. The scenarios involve the release of the entire 2,000 lb contents of the cylinder over 16 minutes. The toxic gas liquified by pressure will be released to the atmosphere with no controls to minimize the release. Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and assuming urban topography the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.0087mg/L of Chlorine is 0.2 miles.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, 1957 edition. Non-combustible chemical storage systems were designed and are maintained in conformance with applicable ASME standards, ANSI standards and chemical suppl"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Lafayette South maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS- Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If Scenario\". The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the Sulfur Dioxide system was performed 6/1/2003 . The most recent PHA review for the Chlorine system was performed 12/1/1999  .\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES- For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Lafayette South maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTRAINING- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Lafayette South has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY-  A.E.

Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE- Written procedures are in place at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Lafayette South to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed in 11/1/2003. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Houlton receives corporate audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM rule are being implemented the most recent compliance audit was conducted 6/1/2003. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective action required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION- A.E. A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Lafayette South promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
