      "SummaryText": "      The Melvin Anhydrous Ammonia facility owned by Sabina Farmers Exchange is located .5 miles north of St.Rt. 22, 5 miles east of Wilmington and 5 miles west of Sabina, Ohio.  This site was choosen because it is located away from any residential and business areas.  It is also placed to benefit from the prevailing winds (west to east) which blow over large amounts of rural terrain.  This facility is used exclusively for the storage of anhydrous ammonia and for the refilling of anhydrous ammonia wagons to be delivered to our farm customers.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this location will vary from 1 - 190 tons, depending on the time of year.  The peak time for storage and movement of product will be during the months of December through June.  The months of July through November are the periods when a minimum amount of anhydrous (1-25 tons) will be stored.                                                                                      The owner and managers at Sabina Farmers Exchange plan and implement safety programs throughout the company.  Any new technology available to insure a safe working environment for all employees is evaluated for additions on an annual basis.  The specific anhydrous ammonia saftey program is evaluated each year to meet company standards as well as federal and state mandates.                                                                                                                                                                                 The facility is located in a remote area and is routinely patroled by Clinton Co. deputy sheriff as well as a night security watchman employed by adjacent stone quarry.  Vandalism has not been a problem at the Melvin facility because of the location and the surveilance of the tank.  We also have night security lighting that covers the entire area that comes on at dusk each evening.  A placard which states emergency telephone numbers for the fire dept., emergency response se"

There is an emergency shutdown button located on site, a respirator is located on site, and all company employees have two-way radios or cell phones on their person.  There is also two 100 gallon water tanks to immerse an entire body if needed.  Water is the ideal treatment for any anhydrous ammonia burn.  Eye goggles and rubber gloves are provided at the location to all employees and customers.  All safety equipment and anhydrous ammonia equipment will be safety checked annually by the fertilizer manager at Sabina Farmers Exchange.  A separate annual inspection will be made independently by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.  All employees of Sabina Farmers Exchange that work with anhydrous ammonia will attend an anhydrous ammonia training school as well as a company sponsered training seminar.  All new hires that will work with anhydrous ammonia that need training wil attend this seminar on an annual basis.\n     We plan to co-ordinate training with the local fire department and the emergency response service.  We will give a complete tour of the facility as well.  At this time, we will educate the group on how our equipment functions, where potential dangers lie with handling the product, and give expedient procedures to reach or locate managers of Sabina Farmers Exchange\n     We have had no anhydrous ammonia injuries to date.  There have been no problems with the surrounding community to require any evacuations as well.\n\n     Worst-case relaese scenario:\n     This scenario is based on the release of 400,000 lbs. (whole tank) of anhydrous ammonia.  This would occur only if a direct collision with the storage tanks occurred causing the tank or supply line to rupture.  The impact to the offsite area would be dependent on the prevailing wind direction and speed.  If the prevailing wind direction (wes"

If the wind is blowing from the north, the impact would affect 4 - 5 residences as well as traffic flow on St. Rt. 22.  This would require the evacuation of the immediate area as well as the re-routing of traffic along St. Rt. 22. until the vapor dissipated.\n\n     Alternative release scenario:\n     This scenario is based on the release of 50 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  This would be caused by the rupture of a hose or a connection leak at the storage tank.  The impact to the area would again be dependent on the wind direction and speed.  If the prevailing wind direction occurred, there would be no effect.  This would be a small amount of anhydrous ammonia which would quickly and easily dissapate into the air.  The same would happen if the wind was blowing from the north, as the amount of anhydrous ammonia would be minimal.\n     Sabina Farmers Exchange has stored anhydrous ammonia for 30 years at our Sabina facility without any incident involving injury or a release of product.  With a continued effort to train our employees and maintain our equipment, we plan to improve on that track record with our Melvin facility as well."
