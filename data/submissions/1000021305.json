Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nB.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Eagle Point Refinery.  The covered process at the refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.  The following summary addresses the combined elements of these three programs and describes the activities surrounding the implementation of each element. These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\n1.\tEmployee Participation\n\nThe Eagle Point Refinery involves employees in the programs developed to support process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are included in every element of the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates.  They are members of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the safety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training and contractor safety programs.  Employees have access to information created as part of this accident prevention program.   \n\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each area and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that area via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and informa"

This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our accidental release prevention programs. \n\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each covered unit. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n4.\tStandard Operating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery units.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical team, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\n5.\tEHS Operator Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the units are provided with comprehensive initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process"

Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n6.\tMechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures & guidelines describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures & guidelines follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI/PM activities are trained on the procedures & guidelines and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n7.\tManagement of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes may inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of an area. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Eagle Point Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change proce"

The review ensures that the following requirements are confirmed prior to start-up: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated and made available to personnel; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n9.\tCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance Audits ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the accidental release prevention programs are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the programs is conducted every year by an audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that practices are consistent with written programs that the programs adequately address all requirements of the process safety regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n10.\tEHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly initiates an investigation of incidents (within 48 hours) that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recur"

The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process unit. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n12.\tContractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.  The safety regulations require contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery. The program also includes a test to ensure they understand the material presented.\n\t\n13.\tEmergency Response\n\nOur Emergency Response Programs assure the readiness of employees to respond appropriately and safely to emergencies involving highly hazardous chemicals.  The Emergency Response Programs are an integrated set of actions that start at the incident source, and initiates actions throughout the facility as appropriate.  Additional details about our Emergency Response Programs are pre"

Our facility openly provides this necessary information to all responsible persons to comply with these requirements.\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention programs work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs.  In addition to the above elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

During the past five years, there have been no accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation and NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program. \n\nD.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe Refinery maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Sara Title III and the NER Emergency Response Programs. The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Contained in the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the refinery.  These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies.  The Programs address all aspects of emergency response including:\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tInformation on the plant emergency organization (Incident Command System)\n\u00c2\u00bf\tInformation on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred\n\u00c2\u00bf\tGuidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination\n\t\nSeveral methods are available to employees and contractors for reporting an emergency in the refinery including telephones and radios.

The dispatcher at Security Headquarters has the ability to telephone the local Fire Department to request assistance or advise on the status of an emergency in progress. The Fire Department and the Police Department would use this information to make decisions on advising the public to evacuate or shelter in place.\n\nThe refinery also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and fire fighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and fire fighting foam.  An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment. Examples of equipment and systems included in the program are as follows:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFire extinguishers - Inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the international fire code,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tClass A chemical suits - Inspected before and after each use, pressure tested annually,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFire hoses - Inspected and pressure tested each year per the fire code,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tStationary fire water pumps - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year per the fire code,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFire apparatus - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tWater spray systems - Inspected and flow tested annually per the fire code.\n\nInspection reports for emergency response equipment are filed onsite.\nWhile we rely on Fire and Emergency Response Supervisor to respond to both minor and significant events in the refinery, we also maintain a close relationship with the West Deptford Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\nE.\tPLANN"
