In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nGerber Products Company is located at 405 West State Street, Fremont, Michigan. The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  \n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nGerber Products Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis was recently completely in April of 2009.

On the roof it is fed to an Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3).  At the Condensers the super heated vapor (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CD).  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with Safety Relief Valves, which vent directly to atmosphere.  Air flow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to the condenser.  Water is supplied by Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3) via a Water Pumps.  \n\nWater from the Condenser Water Sump is pumped via a Water Pumps to the Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3).  At the Condenser the water is sprayed via a spray header over the ammonia coils.  Water is collected"

      "SummaryText": "ty drain back into the High Pressure Receiver (V16) is used as a storage vessel for Ammonia Liquid (HPL).  As Ammonia Liquid (HPL) is needed in the system, it is fed (by a pressure) from the High Pressure Receiver (V16) through a King solenoid valve and is used in the system for liquid (HPL) makeup to High Temperature Accumulator (V15).\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid (HPL) is fed to the Auto Purger (RPU).  Purged Gas (PUR) is piped from the Purged Points to the Auto Purger (RPU).  This system has a multiple purge points. The Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3) has two Purge Points on the Condensed Liquid Drain Outlets.  Each Purge Point consists of a solenoid valve with shutoff valves on either side for isolation.  Any non-condensibles in the Vapor Stream are removed periodically by the Automatic Purger (RPU).  The Purge Gas (PUR) is separated by the Automatic Gas Purger (RPU).  Its separates ammonia from the non-condensibles by condenses the ammonia into a liquid.  Any non-condensibles are piped to a Water Bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia.  Condensed Vapor (LSS) is piped back to the \u00bf20 F Low Temperature Accumulator (V14) Suction Main (LTRS) and thus back to the \u00bf20 F Low Temperature Accumulator (V14).  \n\nThe system is equipped with a Heat Exchanger which heats a glycol solution.  The glycol solution is then piped under the freezer floors to prevent a buildup of permafrost.  This Heat Exchanger (V13) utilizes High Stage Discharge (HSD) which is a high temperature compressed vapor.  This vapor enters the Heat Exchanger via a solenoid valve.  In the Heat Exchanger the vapor rejects heat thus condensing to a liquid where it collects on the bottom of the Heat Exchanger and gravity drains to a liquid drainer.  As the liquid drainer becomes full it will dump the liquid back into the High Stage Suction Main where it is returned to 30 F High Temperature Suction Accumulator (V-15).\n\nLow Temperature Recirculated Liquid (LTRL) that has been pumped from the \u00bf20 F Low Temp"

The (LTRL) passed through a shutoff valve, then an electric solenoid shutoff valve, then a check valve, then a shutoff valve, and the a hand expansion valve (HEV) where the liquid is expanded where it undergoes a deliberate change in pressure and temperature then into the Evaporator Coil.  While in the coil it absorbs heat from the air and changes from a Liquid (LTRL) to a Liquid/Vapor Combination (LTRS).  As the Liquid/Vapor Combination (LTRS) exits the coil it passes through a gas powered stop check valve then through a shutoff valve and then back to the Low Temperature Recirculated Main (LTRS).  These Evaporators (AB, BA, and BB) are equipped with a hot gas circuit.  The Hot Gas (HSD) which is at high temperature is pumped via pressure to the coil.  At the coil it passes through a shutoff valve, part of the gas is used to power the stop check valve closed in the suction line, this is only during defrost operations.  The remainder of the hot gas passes through a hot gas regulator into the coil pan where it defrosts the coil pan at this point the electric solenoid in the Low Temperature Recirculated Liquid (LTRL) Inlet is closed therefore the hot gas travels through the pan and then through the coil, out of the coil through a float drainer, through a check valve and shutoff valve it is returned to the Low Temperature Recirculated Suction (LTRS) main and thus back to the -20 F Low Temperature Accumulator (V14).  This unit is equipped with a solenoid bypass of the gas powered stop valve, this allows for  bleeding of pressure from the coil to the Low Temperature Recirculated Suction Main prior to opening the stop check.\n\nHigh Temperature Recirculated Liquid (HTRL) that has been pumped from the 30 F High Temperature Accumulator (V15) is pumped through Coolers CA, CB, DA, DB, EA, EB, FA, FB, GA, GB, H, I and Hallway evaporators TAA and TAB.

Members of the ERT have completed IC training.  Should additional resources be needed the ERT will request site security to call 911 for assistance from local fire departments and/or medical services.\nThe site Gerber Emergency Management Team will assume an additional support and management role.  This role will include resource allocation, logistics, data, documentation, and communications both internal and external.\n\nRecognition and Prevention\nEmployees are trained to recognize a chemical emergency during their job orientation and hazard communication training.  Employees and supervisors are instructed to call for the ERT if a release cannot be contained without potential exposure.  Between Gerber employees and site security, chemical process systems and chemical storage are monitored around the clock seven days a week (24/7).  Preventative maintenance is performed on the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The site has a Risk Management Plan and a Process Safety Management Plan for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nSafe distances and places of refuge\nIn the event of a chemical release inside a building, which has the potential to create an unsafe atmosphere, the refrigeration building will be evacuated.  In the event that the chemical release would not pose an inhalation hazard, the area of the spill and an appropriate buffer zone will be evacuated until the spill can be cleaned up. Should a site wide chemical emergency occur, the maintenance departments will shut down air handling systems as needed.  In the event of an exterior exposure the employees will be directed to the unexposed side of the building for sheltering in place in the event of an exterior exposure or a full evacuation if the exposure is interior.\nAir monitoring, wind direction and release rates shall determine safe distances and location"
