Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA formal process is established to help ensure that potential hazards associated with the various facility processes are identified and controlled.  Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The HAZard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise. \n\nAny PHA findings or recommendations identified are forwarded to the respective team management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective action tracking database.\n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sweeny Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Operating Procedures\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include:  unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date. \n\nE.  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nF.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and the applicable safe work practices necessary to perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures confirm work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to verify equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or an MOC Team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance.  Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs to help ensure new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSweeny Refinery has developed a team based defect elimination process referred to as TPM (Team Perfected Manufacturing).

For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) in the unit?specific Process Safety Information (PSI). The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nNumerous technical documents are also maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nC.  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA formal process is established to help ensure that potential hazards associated with the various facility processes are identified and controlled.  Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise. \n\nAny PHA findings or recommendations identified are forwarded to the respective team management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that p"

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective action tracking database.\n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sweeny Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation. \n\nD.  Operating Procedures\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include:  unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date. \n\nE.  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.
