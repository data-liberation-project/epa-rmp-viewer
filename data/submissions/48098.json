The plant processes natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities in the vicinity.  Acid gasses (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed, or sweetened, from the inlet gas stream by means of an amine processing unit.  An expander compressor in the refirgeration system causes a significant pressure drop which results in an extreme temperature reduction of the gas, rsulting in the production of natural gas liquids or NGL.  The NGL product is stored in a 28,243 gallon pressurized steel tank for shipping via pipeline, with an expected prodction of 2000 to 4000 bbl per day.\n\nThe NGL components ar eclassified as regulated flammable substances and ae present in the product in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Less than 100 ppm and less than 10,000 lbs of hydrogen sulfide is present in the inlet gas, thus that substance is not included in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Panola Gas Processing Facility is qualified in the Level 3 program for risk management.  The worst-case scenario is identified as a gas vapor explosion, is projected to reach off-site receptors.  As a security measure, the details of the offsite consequence anaylsis are not included in this Executive Summary.  This information can be made available to the EPA, State and local emergency personnel upon request.\n\nThe processes at the Panola Gas Processing Facility are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations as well as OSHA's PSM Standard.  The PHA team has conducted both the What If and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis methods of process hazard review.\n\nThe Panola Gas Processing Facility maintains a written emergency response program designed to help protect workers and ensure safety of the public as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for respoding to a realease of a regulate"
