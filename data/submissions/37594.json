The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Emergency drills are conducted at least quarterly to ensure that the system works as planned.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe facility has coordinated its emergency plan with the City of Vernon Environmental Health Department, the Vernon City Fire Departmante and the Santa Fe Springs HazMat Department.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Improved training programs, safety drills and safety peer audits are some of the upgrades undertaken to improve safety at our facility.  As part of our on going security improvement program, the Los Angeles plant completed a Security Vulnerability Assessment study and used these findings to upgrade the facility's security programs. At each of our facilities we maintain a minimum number of rail cars. When they arrive, we check each car and install our own locks on the domes.  All cars are stored in a well lighted, secured fenced rail siding before they are transferred into our rail-car enclosure. Our rail sidings are also protected by our 24-hour electronic chlorine monitoring system and closed circuit television security system.\n\n7.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Clorox Products Manufacturing Company, (Clorox) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment has led us to develop a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on site to control and mitigate its effects.  We have coordinated our emergency procedures with the City of Vernon Environmental Health Department and Vernon City Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise. The plant also coordinated their emergency procedures with the Santa Fe Springs HazMat Department.\n\nTo learn more about The Clorox Company please visit our web page at:  WWW.CLOROX.COM.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity involves the manufacture of Clorox household cleaning products.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility -- chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the production of sodium hypochlorite, which is the active ingredient in Clorox bleach.\n\nThe largest single container of chlorine at our facility is 180,000 pounds -- the capacity of the railcar in which the chlorine is received.  The covered process at this facility as defined by the EPA is the chlorine handling system that includes storage and use of this regulated substance in the production of sodium hypochlorite.\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68"

Our chlorine handling process is covered by the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the notification requirements of Section 302 of the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\nControl Systems\nOur facility manufacturing systems are designed with multiple safety features to avoid any problems that could be caused by failure of a specific device or control system.  The automatic portion of our normal bleach facility operations are designed for fail-safe operation in the event of a control system failure or a power outage.  Critical functions are additionally protected by battery back-ups.  Finally, we have over-riding controls that are hard-wired to an emergency stop (E-stop) system.  This E-stop system is also designed for fail-safe operation, and it requires manual intervention to reset and start the system.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nClorox maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazardous Operability Studies (HazOps).  The study is conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Per EPA and OSHA requirements, the HazOp is revalidated at least every five years or whenever the process is significantly changed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorine handling process, Clorox maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as start"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nClorox has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that process operators are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually or more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nClorox carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Clorox to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start-up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Clorox.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nClorox conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are bei"
