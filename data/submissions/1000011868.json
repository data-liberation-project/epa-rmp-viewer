These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals.  The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and provide environmental protection.\n\nOur Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the company to conduct all of its operations in a manner, which is consistent with protecting human health and the environment.  It is our policy to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including, but not limited to all permitting, recordekeeping, and reporting requirements.  It is our policy that employees and contractors are properly trained and that they have access to information.  It is our policy to audit compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to promptly remedy any noncompliance.\n\nBecause there is absolutely no envisioned gain worth injury or loss of life, the company is committed to safety.  This commitment is demonstrated through our routine safety training sessions for  employees.  In addition, employees working directly with applicable hazardous chemicals receive annual 8-hour hazardous materials refresher training.\n\nEach year, the written emergency action plan is reviewed and/or updated for the facility.  Each year, the company reports the location and quantity of hazardous chemicals stored at their facility to the local fire department, the local emergency planning committee and the state emergency planning committee.  Each year, the company reports the amount of hazardous chemicals used and/or released to the environment to state and/or federal regulatory agencies.\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state"

John Morrell & Co.'s prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management o change, and pre-startup safety reviews.  In addition, the facility has implemented a training program to ensure that employees are knowledgable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions.  If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. John Morrell & Co. believes the prevention program is the key to minimizing the risk to employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nOur Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is a meatpacking plant located in Sioux City, Iowa.  The facility kills, cuts and packages fresh pork.  The facility utilizes various conveyors and manual and automated processing and packaging equipment.  Various sanitation chemicals are stored and used for cleaning the facility in strict accordance with USDA food safety regulations.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs.  This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas.  Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.  About 66,000 pounds of ammonia is in the refrigeration system throughout the plant.\n\nOur Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, the facility has not had an accident involving ammonia th"

The September 3, 2009, Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Compliance Audit determined that a previously reported accident on April 7, 2006, was not reportable for RMP criteria; therefore the accident history was removed from this RMP update.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility implements an emergency action plan that addresses various emergency response scenarios.  These scenarios include response procedures for various types of chemical releases, fires and other system failures and natural disasters.  This plan is reviewed annually and made available to the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee.\n\nOur Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo substantial projects are currently planned.  Our procedures are established to promote continuous improvement in our operations through inspection, training and auditiing."
