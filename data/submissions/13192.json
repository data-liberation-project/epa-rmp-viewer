Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility, Woodland Biomass Power, Ltd., handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facilitys workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facilitys policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a 28 megawatt (MW), biomass-fired, electrical power generating facility.  The plant burns agricultural and wood fuels in a fluidized bed boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.\n\nAmmonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide Nox emissions in the boiler flu gas.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received at the plant via a liquefied-gas tank-truck and stored in a single 20,000 gallon capacity tank.\n\nThere is a daily maximum of 66,911 lbs of ammonia at the facility.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a 20,000 (Water Capacity) pressure storage tank of ammonia.  Failure of this container will release 66,911 lbs of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire 66,911 lbs is released as gas in ten minutes.  The ammonia storage tank is located outside of any structure or building.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 0.14mg/L (200ppm) for the Worst Case scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for the covered process was determined to be the result of a small hole in a 10 psig ammonia vapor line. It is estimated that"

Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia system operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facilitys main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases occurred within the last five years\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other agency emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  Yolo County incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Commi"

Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other\ncommitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the ammonia system.\n\n\nFAED2899.WPD"
