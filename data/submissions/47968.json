It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe locaiton, and notify the BODE Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what we may have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the BODE, Iowa location is DOUG YETMAR, Fertilizer Department Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency response numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE BODE FERTILIZER PLANT\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the 26,000 gallon nurse tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gasous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp Program (Version 1/06), the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles. The alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hose. The resulting release (according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles. \n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Pomeroy, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in plan to place. \n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of BODE, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons.

Finally, NEW Cooperative has extended to the Bode Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simmulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous system, it is the policy of NEW Cooperative to immediately notify the Bode Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 5 LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Bode Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Bode location, mutal aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire departments) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nNONE"
