The ability to accomplish the function depends on people who are capable of designing, constructing, operating and maintaining this facility.  All products that we load are safe when handled correctly by knowledgeable people.\n\nOur goals are to provide a safe flow of products, and the best available protection for life and property.  To achieve these goals we need capable people, a plan of operation and on-the-scene coordination by a capable supervisor.\n\nCapable people are employee's who have developed a thinking ability that allows them to react to a situation calmly, reasonably, and quickly; an understanding of organization goals and plans; and a complete understanding of products characteristics, work methods, facility, tools and equipment.\n\nThe plan of operation includes the control of product quantity and quality, the coordination of operations and maintenance, and the control and handling of product released from the facility.\n\nCapable supervisor, people who have been trained to evaluate a given situation, make a decision on the plan of action, and get people to perform acts which will execute the plan of action.\n\nAgain, the necessary acts required to achieve our goals must come from the productive power, initiative, and intelligence in very person within the organization.\n\nThis facility is designed to store 450,000 barrels of hydrocarbons (butane or propane) into four underground salt dome caverns and redeliver later at customer request.  To accomplish this function, product is received and redelivered by three methods.  They are rail cars, trucks, and pipeline.\n\nReceiving product, this process is accomplished by unloading rail cars or trucks into above ground storage then transferring product into underground storage.\n\nReceiving product by pipeline, product is received by pipeline and is injected into underground storage.

This leak would cover about a 1760 feet in all directions.  This would affect the public by closing down a state highway for a period of time.  All other accidental releases would be contained in the facility's perimeter.\n\nThis facility complies with the OSHA 1910.119 rule.  This rule basically covers two areas of concern, employee training and facility structure.\n\nTraining, employees in the facility will be trained so they know and understand products characteristics and behaviors, care and operating limitations of this facility, purpose and use of safety equipment, and emergency procedures.  \n\nStructure, this facility is designed and constructed to contain the products being transported with a margin of safety based on research and experience, but within the limits of existing regulations.  It will be inspected and tested to ensure that materials and workmanship meet the design specifications.  Controls and shutdown equipment will be utilized to ensure that the facility operates within the design limits.\n\nWithin the past five years, this facility has had no accidental releases of hydrocarbons.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of hydrocarbons, employees are trained to take the necessary steps to contain the leakage.  The state police will be utilized to notify the public, set road blocks, and evacuate the area if deemed necessary.\n\nOur first priority is for the safety of our employees as well as the environment.  We are always looking for ways to improve through training and mitigating devices.  This facility is adding add"
