      "SummaryText": "RMP DATA ELEMENT - Executive Summary\n\nCPL Lon C. Hill Power Station\n\nLon C. Hill Power Station is one of eight natural gas fueled power generating facilities in the Central Power and Light Company subsidiary, which includes a total of 11 generating facilities throughout South Texas. This site is within the Corpus Christi city limits in Nueces County. The facility has 35 employees.\n\nCentral Power and Light Company (CPL) is an investor-owned utility supplying electric service to a 44,000-square-mile area of South Texas.  The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility is a four unit steam electric power station with a total generation of 510 mw.  It burns natural gas as the primary fuel with #2 fuel oil as the secondary fuel.  Units 1 and 2, rated at 60 and 66 mw, were installed in 1952 and 1954 respectively.  Unit 3, at 150 mw, was installed in 1959, and Unit 4, at 234 mw was installed in 1969.  Units 1, 2, and 3 have General Electric turbines and Unit 4 has a Westinghouse turbine.  Steam is provided by four Babcock and Wilcox boilers.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the Central Power and Light Company Lon C. Hill Power Station on Callicoatte Road in northwest Corpus Christi.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and respon"

      "SummaryText": "se.\n\nThe Lon C. Hill Power Station has been producing electricity for over 40 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community, based upon extreme conditions, defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (May 1996). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do not allow complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Lon C. Hill Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 7.4 miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Lon C. Hill Power Station involves 33 pounds of chlorine released in 60 minutes from a <-inch pigtail or similar connection. The resulting cloud extends 0.68 miles down wind.\n\nCPL's chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typica"

This training includes emphasis on:\n7 Specific safe work practices\n7 Routine operating procedures\n7 Audit and inspection procedures\n7 Emergency operation including shut down\n7 Alarms and emergency notification procedures.\n \n CPL has an established Preventative Maintenance Procedure 440 specifically developed for the chlorination system. This procedure requires:\n7 Periodic inspection and testing of all mechanical systems \n7 Detailed documentation of all inspection and maintenance activity\n7 Documentation of equipment deficiencies\n7 Timely and appropriate repair of all deficiencies.\n \n A Process Safety Management System has been specifically developed for the chlorination system at this plant in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act Process Safety Management rule. This management system requires:\n7 An initial and periodic analysis of engineering and administrative controls\n7 Investigation procedures designed to resolve and correct potential incidents\n7 Formal audits performed by trained individuals with knowledge of chlorination systems.\n \n All Plant personnel handling chlorine are specially trained. This training includes:\n7 Emergency shutdown\n7 Emergency operation of the chlorinator\n7 Hazards of chlorine\n7 Safety procedures to be followed during normal operations\n7 Emergency Response Procedures\n7 Notification procedures\n7 Evacuation procedures.\n Periodic inspection of the equipment is mandatory.
