      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nAt the FXI,Inc. in San Leandro, CA we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce bedding, furniture, and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in outdoor storage tanks with secondary containment.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 350,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is"

      "SummaryText": "conveyed to cutting stations where it is cut to the  and shape specified by our customers.\r\n\r\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceed EPA threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\r\n\r\nMost people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA process safety management standard (PSM).
