The tank is located within the security fenced in area and is closely monitored with surveillance cameras.  The tank is protected from the UV and heat radiation of the sun under 3 sided enclosure. The CL2 Storage Tank can be shut-in remotely by pressing an emergency shutdown button located near the tank and in the Plants Control Room.    \n\n\n\nLiquid sulfur dioxide is delivered and unloaded from tankers into the 78k-lb capacity Sulfur Dioxide Storage Tank. The tank is located within the security fenced in area and is closely monitored with surveillance cameras. The SO2 Storage Tank can be shut-in remotely by pressing an emergency shutdown button located near the tank and in the Plants Control Room.    \n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is delivered and unloaded from tankers into the 72k-lb capacity Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Tank. The tank is located within the security fenced in area and is closely monitored with surveillance cameras.  The NH3 Storage Tank can be shut-in remotely by pressing an emergency shutdown button located near the tank and in the Plants Control Room.    \n\n\n\nIn order to prevent and/or reduce the severity of an unwarranted chemical release, Woodward Iodine has strict procedures and policies that must be adhered to by all employees and contractors.  Woodward Iodine has integrated redundant safety interlocks and alarms within its processing system in order to prevent any chemical releases.  Woodward Iodine revisits and revises procedures on a periodic basis or when incidents (near misses) are reported.   \n\n\n\nWoodward Iodine Corporation will respond to small chemical leaks and fires.  For large spills, leaks, or fires Woodward Iodine Corporation Employees are trained to shut down equipment remotely and evacuate the facility safely.   The Woodard Fire Department, a trained and fully staff HazMat First Responder, will asses any mandatory evacuations without notifying the community.  Woodward Iodine will Notify the Fire Department via 911 and meet the first responders at a pre-determined location.   The fire department will be the liaison between all other emergency responders and the OEM of Woodward.     \n\n",
