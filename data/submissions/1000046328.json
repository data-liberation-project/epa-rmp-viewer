This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous). Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the West Jordan Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services. In addition, we have a contract with the L.A. Roser Company to provide 24 hour service and emergency response on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated extremely hazardous substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 22,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40CFR, Part 68 of the EPA Clean Air Act regulation. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulation, 29CFR1910.119. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.
