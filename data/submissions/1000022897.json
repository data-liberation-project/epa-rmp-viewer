      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nIntel has a comprehensive Environmental, Health, and Safety Program that address all aspects of the life cycle of its processes, facilities, and products.  Its Process Safety/Risk Management program described here addresses how Intel manages the risks associated with high hazard chemical processes to prevent accidental releases, fires, or injuries related to process upsets with high or catastrophic potential.  In regard to the usage of hydrogen chloride, Intel's advanced processes are consuming higher volumes of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) than previous process technologies.  To accommodate the increased HCl demand, without increasing exposure risk, Intel is implementing an industry standard offering ISO module/trailer based HCl gas delivery to replace a smaller industry standard y-cylinder.  Doing this will increase the  of the gas delivery package, but it will also reduce projected package change frequency at advanced process factories from > 100 changes per year to less than 5 changes per year.  It is well known in the gas industry that it is the package change which represents the highest risk for a release potential.   Between July 2010 and July 2011, Intel has conducted numerous hazard assessments in conjunction with the ISO module supplier and our Architectural and Engineering (A&E) Consultant in preparation for this transition.  This included conducting numerous HazOp studies, consequence analysis on numerous scenarios, and a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA)  in order to determine the risk management and control strategies.  The following describes the comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program elements for all high hazard chemical systems.\n\n\nSAFETY IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN\n\nToday's semiconductor facilities utilize toxic, corrosive, pyrophoric, and flammable materials. These materials are inherently hazardous, sometimes in small quantities, and therefore safety engineering is required to c"

The risk management and control of these risks starts by integrating EHS systems into the procurement and installation of process equipment, facilities design, the safe commissioning and pre-startup safety process of these new facilities. \nIntel's EHS requirements for the procurement of process equipment are primarily driven to the front of the supplier chain through the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturers Institute (SEMI) guideline process, an organization that develops standards for its members. EHS requirements such as SEMI S2 (safety), SEMI S8 (ergonomics), and S10 (hazard classification) are just part of the \"S\" series of SEMI guidelines intended to define these industry safety standards for process equipment. In addition, Intel-specific requirements are included to address other risks. These include combustible material restrictions to reduce fire risk and environmental characterization and emissions requirements to control and manage our site environmental permitting requirements for air, waste, and water emissions. \nAfter the procurement of process equipment, it must be installed and integrated into facility systems. To accomplish this, EHS has integrated its requirements into the process equipment installation standards. This includes ergonomic clearances for safe maintenance and operation, ventilation, spill control, gas detection, and all EHS aspects related to how the process equipment is  installed. After these requirements have been established for equipment installations at the TD site, they are transferred via the Master Design Package, which documents how all process equipment is installed at high volume manufacturing sites. \nSemiconductor process equipment is supported by larger facilities systems that perform gas distribution, bulk chemical delivery, and waste treatment. EHS requirements are integrated into the design of this equipment through the Intel EHS Facilities Equipment"

This starts with outlining process safety expectations early in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request For Quote (RFQ) from each supplier, and ends in the final design of the equipment. \nProcess equipment and facilities equipment must all reside within the walls of the actual fabrication facilities. EHS has integrated its requirements through the EHS Master Design Standard (MDS). The EHS MDS defines the requirements and expectations for the fabrication facilities.  This standard is used to support the many codes, standards, and regulations that drive the design of our facilities. \n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nAll new facilities systems utilizing high hazard chemicals have a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted to assess the upset conditions the equipment may present, the controls in place, and the adequacies of these controls to prevent events with high or catastrophic potential. This process is a 3 step approach:\n\n1.  An initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) is required on all new chemical facilities systems regardless of the  and applicability to OSHA PSM or EPA RMP.  One the following methodologies are  utilized to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n     What-If Checklist;\n     Hazard Mode Effects Analysis\n     Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP);\n\n2.   Conduct consequence analysis (dispersion modeling) of credible release scenarios identified in the PHA.  The goal is to have adequate safeguards in place to prevent an impact to the local community.\n3.  After the PHA is conducted, a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is conducted on all severe/catastrophic scenarios (including any potential off-site impacts) to ensure that the controls are sufficient to meet the internal Corporate Risk Tolerance Criteria.\n \n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nAfter the integration of EHS requirements into the proc"

Intel has a formal Commissioning Program for all facilities systems which integrates the Environmental, Health, and Safety aspects of startup.  This includes a startup after a system modification.  This is to ensure:\nA?    Construction and equipment is installed in accordance with design specifications;\nA?    Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\nA?    Safety systems and controls are tested and functional;\nA?

This includes:\n1.    All hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process shall utilize the Intel Hot Work Program which requires that all non-electrical hot work must be permitted by use of a Non-Electrical Hot Work Permit\n2.    Work on any portion of the  manufacturing process included on the Site Incident Prevention Program (SIPP).  SIPP provides a permitting system to ensure that all work near or on manufacturing processes  or equipment are reviewed by the area and system for impacts to production or safety.\n3.    All Hazard Production Material (HPM) rooms are accessible only to trained and approved personnel via card reader access/control.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe design, operation, and maintenance of all the manufacturing process and facilities systems and equipment are controlled by the Intel Facilities Change Control Board (FCCB) Whitepaper process.   The FCCB is responsible for documenting new facilities systems (design and qualification), controlling changes in facilities systems, documenting POR (Plan of Record) and controlling changes in manufacturing process equipment installations.

In addition, it assists in collection of complete and accurate documentation associated with injury and illness incidents.  In addition, the Corporate Standard - EHS Bulletin Incident Program ensures that significant Safety and Health incidents are appropriately resolved and learning's from these incidents are communicated to prevent the reoccurrence at any site.  This program requires immediate investigation and initial notification to management within 24 hours of a serious incident.\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nAll Intel sites have a formal Emergency Management Plan, which includes the formation of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and Emergency Response Team (ERT). ERT members act as first responders to provided immediate assessment, assistance and event mitigation.  ERT coordinates with the EOC and has direct interface with outside agency responders (fire dept). ERT Members receive extensive training before they participate in the ERT. This includes a five day foundation course covering emergency response procedures, radio use, first aid/CPR, use of breathing apparatus, fire safety, chemical spill cleanup and gas leak detection.  \n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nA compliance focused self-assessment audit of the process safety management program is conducted by site at a minimum of every three years.  In addition, a Corporate Audit team is established that conducts formal EHS program audits on a periodic basis.  PSM/RMP is one of the protocols of this audit."
