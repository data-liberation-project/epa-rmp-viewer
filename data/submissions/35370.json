Because chlorine is toxic, it is necessary to observe certain precautions in handling it in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the population living or working on adjacent properties.  It is the policy of the NCWTP to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safe handling of chlorine depends on adherence to safe handling procedures, incorporation of proper safety devices into the design of the chlorine facility, and adequate training of all facility personnel with respect to handling procedures and safety devices.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the North Chicago Fire department and any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe NCWTP purifies water for use as drinking water in the City of North Chicago.  In addition, it supplies disinfected water to Abbott Labs for use in cooling towers.  Chlorine is supplied to the facility in 1-ton cylinders by delivery trucks, escorted through the City by the local police department.  The storage capacity of the facility is 16,000 pounds (8 one-ton cylinders).  Access to the chlorine rooom is restricted to authorized Water Department employees and management personnel, and to vendor delivery personnel.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo releases occurred in the past five years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program for the NCWTP was based on Pamphlet 64 of the Chlorine Institute and emergency response protocols contained in SARA Title III.  The Emergency Response Program is currently being updated in conjunction with the Vulnerability Assessment for the NCWTP and will be completed in December of 2004.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe N"
