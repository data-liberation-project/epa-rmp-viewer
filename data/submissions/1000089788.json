      "SummaryText": "ltiple accumulators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds multiple bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Cold Storage Rooms and Packing Area. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\n\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to the evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condensers. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. This system is also equipped with a thermosyphon vessel located between the evaporative condensers"

Opening Valve #2 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system.  Opening Valve #3 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.\n\n\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. The relief valves on the high side of the system relieve at 250 or 300 psig while the low side of the system relieves at 150 psig. All pressure relief valves are piped to vent to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nSelect relief valve assemblies are equipped with a relief vent indicator (RVI) to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. Indicator flags are mounted to the shaft of the RVI on the outside of the housing. A paddle is set such that any sudden flow in the relief vent line pushes it down simultaneously raising the flags which then provide a clear signal that a relief valve has lifted. Stoppers mounted to the exterior prevent the flag/shaft from rotating more than the 90? swing.\n\n\n\nThe Main Suction Accumulator is equipped with a High Level Float Switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\n1.2.5 Process Classification\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Family Tree Farms consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

The Room 5/Packing Area has two (2) ammonia detectors. One on the east side and one on the west side.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Family Tree Farms facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 20,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCalifornia \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nFederal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

      "SummaryText": "Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Family Tree Farms continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Family Tree Farms' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Family Tree Farms' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Family Tree Farms has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Family Tree Farms now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Family Tree Farms employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Family Tree Farms will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
