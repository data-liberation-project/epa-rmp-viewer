Nevertheless, Family Tree Farms continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Family Tree Farms' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Family Tree Farms' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nFamily Tree Farms has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Family Tree Farms has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Family Tree Farms now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Family Tree Farms employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Family Tree Farms will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The relief valves on the high side of the system relieve at 250 or 300 psig while the low side of the system relieves at 150 psig. All pressure relief valves are piped to vent to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSelect relief valve assemblies are equipped with a relief vent indicator (RVI) to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. Indicator flags are mounted to the shaft of the RVI on the outside of the housing. A paddle is set such that any sudden flow in the relief vent line pushes it down simultaneously raising the flags which then provide a clear signal that a relief valve has lifted. Stoppers mounted to the exterior prevent the flag/shaft from rotating more than the 90\u00ba swing.\r\n\r\nThe Main Suction Accumulator is equipped with a High Level Float Switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation.

Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds multiple bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Cold Storage Rooms and Packing Area. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\r\n\r\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to the evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condensers. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. This system is also equipped with a thermosyphon vessel located between the evaporative condensers"

As this liquid absorbs the heat from the oil, it evaporates inside the oil cooler, and returns to the thermosyphon vessel.\r\n\r\n1.2.4 Safety Systems\r\n\r\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) ammonia detectors. One provides low concentration detection and alerts facility personnel and Cold Storage Technologies (CST) if the ammonia concentration exceeds 50 ppm. Audible and visual alarms will be initiated inside and outside the machinery room. In addition, a train horn will activate alerting personnel throughout the facility. A high-level detector is set at 7,5000 ppm and will shut down all refrigeration machinery inside the refrigeration machinery room, and activate an audible alarm and strobe. If the concentration reaches 25 ppm, the emergency ventilation system will kick in.\r\n\r\nEach cold room is equipped with one (1) ammonia detector. The Room 5/Packing Area has two (2) ammonia detectors. One on the east side and one on the west side. Each detector alerts facility personnel and Cold Storage Technologies (CST) if the ammonia concentration exceeds 50 ppm. Audible and visual alarms will be initiated inside each room. In addition, a train horn will activate alerting personnel throughout the facility. Each zone will shut down the liquid feed solenoid and the circulating fans if the ammonia concentration exceeds 75 ppm.\r\nThe machinery room is equipped with a roof-mounted emergency ventilation fan that automatically activates at 25 ppm. The emergency ventilation system can be controlled manually by the LOW/OFF/HI switch located outside adjacent to the principal machinery room door.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Control Box was installed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2 and the Fire Code at the time of construction.  The control box contains three (3) valves.\r\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\r\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\r\nValve #3: High to"
