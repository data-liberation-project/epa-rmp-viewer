The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\nAt General Chemical Bay Point Works, three listed chemicals are managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to program level 3 include Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid. As identified in this plan, Bay Point Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for management of Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid.\n\nThis RMP describes Bay Point Work's risk management program which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency"

Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Bay Point Works has prepared employees, in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release.\n\n2.0 Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nGeneral Chemical's Bay Point Works is a chemical production facility that manufactures a broad line of semiconductor grade wet chemicals.  With purities that extend to the parts-per-trillion level, these high quality acids, etchants, solvents, cleaning formulations and other process chemicals are used by semiconductor and wafer fabricators the world over.  Four processes at Bay Point Works use one of the regulated chemicals identified above.  The processes, and associated regulated chemicals, are outlined below:\n\nProcess - Ammonium Hydroxide\nRegulated chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\nUse - Raw Material\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) - 54,000*\n\nProcess -- Electronic Grade Hydrofluoric Acid\nRegulated chemical - Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride \nUse - Raw Material\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) - 610,000\n\n\nProcess -- Ammonium Fluoride\nRegulated chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\nUse - Raw Material\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) - 54,000*\n\nProcess -- Hydrochloric Acid\nRegulated chemical - Hydrochloric Acid\nUse - Raw Material/Product\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) - 300,000\n\n*  Note the Ammonium Hydroxide and Ammonium Fluoride processes share a common storage vessel containing 54,000 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions require that General Chemical provide information about the worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenarios for Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid handle"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n3.1\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fail and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time. USEPA-designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Bay Point Works assumes that a rail car containing Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems fail, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 25 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n3.2\tAlternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative case release scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case release scenario is calculated based on a USEPA-designated table, and is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents.\n\n3.2.1    The alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride at Bay Point Works assumes Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride would be lost due to the failure of a transfer hose during the unloading process. It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release.  The USEPA-designated tables states that the material released would travel 1.05 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration. \n. \n3.2.2 The alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia at Bay Point Works assumes Anhydrous Ammonia would be lost due to the failure of a transfer hose during the unloading process."

It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release.  The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 0.55 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration.  \n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Bay Point Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\n* Standard Operating Procedures - Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\n* Employee Participation - Employees at all levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.  \n\n* Training - Employees in the operating process are trained in detail to ensure proper operation of the plant.\n\n* Management of Change - Process parameters are"
