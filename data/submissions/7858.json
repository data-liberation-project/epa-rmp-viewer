A heat exchanger using water from the Ottawa\r\nRiver for non-contact cooling leaked and formaldehyde was\r\nreleased into the Ottawa River.  The leak was discovered on July\r\n7, 1994.  The river was depleted of dissolved oxygen as a result\r\nof the release, but recovered after the leak was repaired.  The\r\nCity of Toledo Division of Environmental Services estimated the\r\nleak began on or about June 13, 1994.  No off-site injuries\r\noccurred and no evacuations were required.  A cooling tower was\r\ninstalled to provide non-contact cooling water and the use of\r\nriver water was discontinued by March 1995.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols has not had an accidental release of\r\nacetaldehyde within the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols is submitting two situations that meet the EPA\r\ncriteria for worst-case release scenarios.  One situation covers\r\nthe storage of acetaldehyde and the second situation covers the\r\nstorage of formaldehyde.  Perstorp Polyols is also submitting\r\ntwo situations that are required under EPA criteria for\r\nalternative release scenarios; one for acetaldehyde and one for\r\nformaldehyde.  All four situations have off-site impacts in that\r\nmodeling indicates the impact will leave the facility property. \r\nPerstorp Polyols has used the EPA Off-site Consequences Analysis\r\nGuidance for modeling these situations.  Based on this guidance,\r\nnone of the situations will have an impact on residential areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcetaldehyde is a clear, colorless liquid solution.

Perstorp Polyols stores acetaldehyde\r\nin pressurized tanks equipped with a nitrogen blanket to reduce\r\nthe flammability of the vapor if released.  According to the EPA\r\ncriteria for worst-case scenarios, Perstorp Polyols assumed that\r\ntwo interconnected storage tanks of acetaldehyde failed\r\ncompletely.  The resulting release would spill into a concrete\r\nsecondary containment area.  The EPA criteria require us to\r\nassume that the tanks were 100% full and that entire amount\r\nwould instantaneously vaporize and explode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EPA criteria for alternative release scenarios require us to\r\nassume a more likely release situation.  The more likely\r\nsituation chosen for acetaldehyde is a leak from a two-inch\r\ndiameter unloading hose during transfer of acetaldehyde.  This\r\nsituation was chosen because it had the furthest off-site impact\r\nof the more likely release situations analyzed.  The leak point\r\nis railroad unloading station near Dura Avenue.  The release is\r\nassumed to occur for 10 minutes.  A leak is unlikely to occur\r\nfor longer than 10 minutes since an operator attends the\r\nunloading process at all times.  If a leak develops in this\r\narea, the operator would respond immediately to shutdown the\r\nunloading process and this action would stop the leak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde is a colorless liquid solution containing about 52%\r\nformaldehyde.

Perstorp Polyols has evaluated\r\npotential release situations and past accidents discussed in the\r\nfive-year accident history section to determine the situation\r\nwith the furthest off-site impact.  The alternative situation\r\nsubmitted for formaldehyde is a pump failure that causes a\r\nrelease in the concrete secondary containment area.

This prevention program\r\nbegins with designing for safety in the processes.  All systems\r\nare designed according to accepted industry codes.  Perstorp\r\nPolyols' plants and operating systems are designed and operated\r\nwith redundant safety systems and instrumentation.  The purpose\r\nof these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the\r\nevent a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology is used\r\nin the design and construction of processes.  All new or\r\nmodified plants are inspected and reviewed before start-up. \r\nTanks used to store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary\r\ncontainment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases from\r\nreaching soil, ground or surface water.  Most tanks are equipped\r\nwith high level alarms that alert operators that the tanks are\r\nnearly full and some of these alarms are equipped to shutdown\r\nthe pump that is supplying the tank to prevent overfilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother step of the prevention program includes the maintenance\r\nof the plants and their safety systems.  Preventative\r\nmaintenance on processes is regularly conducted to protect\r\nagainst equipment failures.  While this does not guarantee that\r\nequipment will not occasionally break down, it reduces the risk\r\nthat a problem will occur.  Safety systems are inspected and\r\ntested regularly to ensure that they will be operational if a\r\nproblem develops within the process.

This plan contains information on the processes involving\r\nformaldehyde and acetaldehyde at the Perstorp Polyols' facility,\r\nthe prevention programs for the processes, the emergency\r\nresponse program for the facility, the necessary release\r\nscenario using EPA criteria and guidance documents for modeling,\r\nand the facility's five-year accident history.  This section is\r\ndesigned to summarize the information contained in the plan and\r\ndescribe the approach to prevention of releases used by Perstorp\r\nPolyols in Toledo, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols is committed to operating the facility in a\r\nsafe and environmentally friendly- manner.  We have committed to\r\nmaking continuous progress toward the vision of no accidents,\r\ninjuries, or harm to the environment.   One way that Perstorp\r\nPolyols demonstrates this commitment is by participating in the\r\nResponsible Care initiative.  Responsible Care is an initiative\r\ndeveloped by the Chemical Manufacturers Association designed to\r\nimprove performance in the areas of safety, health, and the\r\nenvironment.  Perstorp Polyols signed the Guiding Principles of\r\nResponsible Care in 1988 and reaffirmed our commitment in 1999\r\nwhen our President signed the newly revised Guiding Principles. \r\nResponsible Care includes management practices that address\r\nperformance ideals in the areas of process safety, community\r\noutreach and emergency response, distribution of products and\r\nraw materials, prevention of pollution, employee health and\r\nsafety, as well as product stewardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols in Toledo has been recommended for\r\ncertification under the International Standards Organization\r\n(ISO) 14001 standard for environmental management systems.  This\r\ncertification means that the Toledo facility has a w"

This step ensures that safety and health\r\nissues will be addressed in a systematic manner that strives for\r\ncontinuous improvement.  By addressing these matters this way,\r\nPerstorp Polyols is incorporating the management practices of\r\nResponsible Care with the international ISO 14001 standard in\r\nour work every day to reduce the risk of accidents that could\r\nresult in harm to our employees, the public, and the\r\nenvironment.  Perstorp Polyols is also certified under the ISO\r\n9002 standard for Quality Systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the Risk Management Planning process, Perstorp\r\nPolyols has worked closely with the Lucas County Local Emergency\r\nPlanning Committee.  This close working relationship helps\r\neducate our emergency responders of the risks that are presented\r\nby our facility, the work that is on-going to prevent accidents\r\nfrom occurring and reduce the potential impact of an accident if\r\nit occurs, and make them more familiar with our facility.  We\r\nalso benefit from this relationship in that we learn from the\r\nexperience of our emergency responders in dealing with incidents\r\nat other facilities and the preventative actions that can be\r\ntaken to further reduce the risk of an accident at our facility.\r\n Our work with the Lucas County LEPC gave us the opportunity to\r\nassist in educating the public about the potential risks of our\r\nfacility posed by the chemicals covered by the risk management\r\nrule and the preparedness of our local emergency responders in\r\nthe event an accident occurs at our facility.  Perstorp Polyols\r\nparticipated in an informational meeting sponsored by the LEPC\r\nfor public officials within Lucas County and surrounding\r\ncommunities.  We also set up a boot"

Perstorp Polyols Inc began operations in\r\nToledo, Ohio in 1977 with the purchase of a Pentaerythritol and\r\nSodium Formate manufacturing facility. Since 1977 the operations\r\nhave expanded to include manufacturing of Trimethylolpropane and\r\nFormaldehyde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Perstorp Polyols completed construction and started a\r\nnew state-of-the-art Formaldehyde plant. This plant was designed\r\nusing Perstorp Polyols' own technology with stack gas recycling\r\nand a catalytic emission control system to reduce emissions by\r\noxidizing volatile organic chemicals to water and carbon\r\ndioxide.   The Formaldehyde is used both in house in the\r\nPentaerythritol and Trimethylolpropane manufacturing processes\r\nand is sold externally for use in the manufacturing of\r\nparticleboard, clothing and pharmaceuticals.  Formaldehyde is\r\none of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk\r\nManagement Planning rule and is included as part of this\r\nsubmission because it is stored at the facility in excess of\r\n15,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPentaerythritol and Trimethylolpropane are used in the\r\nproduction of resins for paint and coatings, inks and adhesives,\r\nlubricants and urethane foam. Sodium Formate is used for paper\r\nbleaching, leather tanning, cattle feed and in the"
