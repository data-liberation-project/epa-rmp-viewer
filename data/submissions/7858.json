This plan contains information on the processes involving\n\nformaldehyde and acetaldehyde at the Perstorp Polyols' facility,\n\nthe prevention programs for the processes, the emergency\n\nresponse program for the facility, the necessary release\n\nscenario using EPA criteria and guidance documents for modeling,\n\nand the facility's five-year accident history.  This section is\n\ndesigned to summarize the information contained in the plan and\n\ndescribe the approach to prevention of releases used by Perstorp\n\nPolyols in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerstorp Polyols is committed to operating the facility in a\n\nsafe and environmentally friendly- manner.  We have committed to\n\nmaking continuous progress toward the vision of no accidents,\n\ninjuries, or harm to the environment.   One way that Perstorp\n\nPolyols demonstrates this commitment is by participating in the\n\nResponsible Care initiative.  Responsible Care is an initiative\n\ndeveloped by the Chemical Manufacturers Association designed to\n\nimprove performance in the areas of safety, health, and the\n\nenvironment.  Perstorp Polyols signed the Guiding Principles of\n\nResponsible Care in 1988 and reaffirmed our commitment in 1999\n\nwhen our President signed the newly revised Guiding Principles. \n\nResponsible Care includes management practices that address\n\nperformance ideals in the areas of process safety, community\n\noutreach and emergency response, distribution of products and\n\nraw materials, prevention of pollution, employee health and\n\nsafety, as well as product stewardship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerstorp Polyols in Toledo has been recommended for\n\ncertification under the International Standards Organization\n\n(ISO) 14001 standard for environmental management systems.

This prevention program\n\nbegins with designing for safety in the processes.  All systems\n\nare designed according to accepted industry codes.  Perstorp\n\nPolyols' plants and operating systems are designed and operated\n\nwith redundant safety systems and instrumentation.  The purpose\n\nof these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the\n\nevent a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology is used\n\nin the design and construction of processes.  All new or\n\nmodified plants are inspected and reviewed before start-up. \n\nTanks used to store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary\n\ncontainment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases from\n\nreaching soil, ground or surface water.  Most tanks are equipped\n\nwith high level alarms that alert operators that the tanks are\n\nnearly full and some of these alarms are equipped to shutdown\n\nthe pump that is supplying the tank to prevent overfilling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother step of the prevention program includes the maintenance\n\nof the plants and their safety systems.  Preventative\n\nmaintenance on processes is regularly conducted to protect\n\nagainst equipment failures.  While this does not guarantee that\n\nequipment will not occasionally break down, it reduces the risk\n\nthat a problem will occur.  Safety systems are inspected and\n\ntested regularly to ensure that they will be operational if a\n\nproblem develops within the process.

The more likely\n\nsituation chosen for acetaldehyde is a leak from a two-inch\n\ndiameter unloading hose during transfer of acetaldehyde.  This\n\nsituation was chosen because it had the furthest off-site impact\n\nof the more likely release situations analyzed.  The leak point\n\nis railroad unloading station near Dura Avenue.
