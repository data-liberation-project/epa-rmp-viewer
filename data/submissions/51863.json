We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including;\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation.\n\n-An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n-A fire-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP.\n\n-An overview of our emergency response program.\n\n-An overview of improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\n-The certifications that EPA\u00bfs RMP rule requires us to provide.\n\n-The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Ferro Delaware River Plant uses a variety of materials and processing operations to produce:\n-Benzyl chloride, which is used as an intermediate to produce a variety of end-products, including plasticizers, perfumes, biocides and flavorings.\n\n-Plasticizers, which are used to produce vinyl flooring, wire coating, caulk and other soft vinyl end products.\n\n-Dibutyl phenyl phosphate (DBPP) which is used to make hydraulic fluids for use to aviation control systems. Tri-isobutyl phosphate (TiBP) is not currently and has not been made onsite for years.\n\nOur plant operates 24 hours, (7) days a week, year-round, except for planned or unplanned downtime for maintenance or inventory control.

Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nToxics\n\nOur facility uses two RMP-regulated chemicals, chlorine and phosphorous oxychloide, to produce our products.\n\nChlorine, which is purchased, is used at our site to produce benzyl chloride and is stored in and distributed from railroad tank cars. Chlorine is a gas at normal pressure and temperature, but is stored as a liquid under pressure in the tank cars. It is unloaded directly from the tank car into a steam-heated vaporizer, where it is heated to vaporize the liquid chlorine for use.\n\nFlammables:\n\nWe have no RMP-regulated flammables stored or handled at our facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including those incorporated into EPA, OSHA and New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act requirements:\n-Inventory Control to minimize the quantity that could be released in an accident.\n\n-Process Safety Information to ensure up-to-date parameters for safely operating the process.\n\n-Process Hazards Analysis to identify and correct potential safety problems.\n\n-Standard Operating Procedures which describe how to safely operate the process.\n\n-Training to ensure that operators and mechanics are qualified to safely perform their job.\n\n-Mechanical Integrity/Preventive Maintenance to inspect and test equipment to ensure mechanical integrity and minimize"
