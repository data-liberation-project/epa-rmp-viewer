      "SummaryText": "R&D Plastics of Hickory, Ltd. manufactures foam products for the furniture industry using isobutene as a blowing agent in Hickory, NC (Catawba County).  This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\n\n\nThe manufacturing process is supported by a 6,880 gallon butane storage which sits on a 40? x 10? x 8? concrete pad and is secured by a chain linked fence.  Butane is delivered via truck tank.  Butane is piped via pump underground to the facility wall where it then enters into the facility and piped and regulated to the extruder(s).   \n\n\n\nThe RMP rule defines the worst-case releases as ?the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or a process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint? (40 CFR Part 68.3).  The worst-case release scenario (WSC) for the R& D Plastics of Hickory considers the catastrophic failure of the 6,880-gallon storage tank of isobutane (25,000 pounds) vaporizes with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  In accordance with EPA guidance, the entire tank contents are involved in the vapor cloud explosion since there is no passive mitigation system to contain the release.  Using EPA?s RMP*Comp the calculated estimated distance to 1 p.s.i. overpressure is 0.2 miles.  The estimated residential population within distance to endpoint is zero (0). \n\n\n\nThe RMP rule defines the alternative release scenarios (ARS) as release events that are more likely than the WCS (40 CFR Part 68.3).  The rule also dictates that ARS should result in off site consequences.  R& D Plastics of Hickory considered a release caused by a transfer hose rupture is more likely than the WCS scenario.  During such a rupture, the active mitigation devices are assumed to work properly, containing the isobutane release to the contents of the transfer hose.  The isobutane release occurs over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting vapor cl"

Using EPA?s RMP*Comp the calculated estimated distance to 1 p.s.i. overpressure is 0.02 miles.  The estimated residential population within distance to endpoint is zero (0). \n\n\n\nIsobutane is a regulated substance under both the RMP and process safety management (PSM) rules.  Therefore R&D Plastics of Hickory has developed an active release prevention plan a long with RMP in the anticipation of its manufacturing capacity.  Key components of the accident prevention program include: high level training for operators, a preventative maintenance program, technological process and safety equipment, effective operating procedures, and a routine inspection program. The facility reports no accidental releases from start of business to the present.\n\n\n\nR&D Plastics of Hickory has in-place a written emergency response plan for employee evacuation.  R&D Plastics of Hickory will rely on local resources for responding to a release at the facility.  R&D Plastics of Hickory maintains an active process safety management team to continually monitor and look for opportunities to improve their overall safety programs."
