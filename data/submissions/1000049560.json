Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream Company exercises many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to upsets in the system.\r\n\r\nThe Factory Engineer is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB - Stationary source and regulated substances Handled\r\n\r\nNestle Dreyer's Ice Cream Company Bakersfield Plant produces ice-cream products for sale to the public. The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration system to freeze ice-cream products and also to operate the plant air-conditioning.  Since the two ammonia refrigeration system have interconnected piping they are considered a single process. Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the Bakersfield plant, in reference to RMP submittal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC - Description of the Accidental Release Prevention program \r\n\r\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation. The ammonia prevention program consists of the follow elements:\r\n\r\n  1) Employee Participation Program\r\n  2) Process Safety Information\r\n  3) Process Hazard Analysis\r\n  4) Operating Procedures\r\n  5) Training Program\r\n  6) Contractor Safety Program\r\n  7) Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\n  8) Mechanical Integrity Program\r\n  9) Hot Work Perm"
