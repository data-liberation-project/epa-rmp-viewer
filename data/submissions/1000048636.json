The properties that make\n\nAnhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions\n\nin handling it. It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state\n\nrules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the\n\ncommunity. Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle\n\nanhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers as a\n\nnitrogen source, with its primary use as a crop land fertilizer. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck\n\n(transports) and is stored in two (2) storage tanks. Anhydrous ammonia is distributed from this facility by\n\nnurse tanks. The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports and nurse\n\ntanks. Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted to authorized employees and management\n\npersonnel, along with authorized contractors that may work on the facility.\n\nThe only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount stored at\n\nthe site is 137,000 gallons or 712,000 pounds which includes a maximum of 101 nurse tanks and 2 bulk storage tanks. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with\n\nother applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations. The facility design and construction is in\n\naccordance with the ANSI K 61.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards. It is f"

The facility is also inspected on a\n\nquarterly basis by trained employees and prior to each use. Corrective and routine maintenance is\n\nperformed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards. Employees of the crop\n\nproduction department at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle\n\nhazardous materials along with additional training using industry training programs and schools.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThis site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to\n\nthe date of submitting this report.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nThis facility relies on the local emergency response unit and does not have its own emergency response\n\nprogram. However, employees are familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, and\n\nthe local fire department is familiar with the plant.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility utilizes the ANSI and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous\n\nammonia. At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility.\n\n"
