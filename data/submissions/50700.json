This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.\nPRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The prevention program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) regulation as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Caguas filtration plant is already observing required engineering Controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, Contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nCaguas Sur Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plant supplies the potable water. The Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\nThe Chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in 1 ton containers. Caguas Sur  Plant may has a storage maximum volume of 10,000 Lbs\ndistributed in 5 containers. Two containers are connected to the vacuum operated chlorinator valves and through one of them, the dosified chlorine flows to the Ejectors where the chlorine is combined with water and then sent to the injections points in the process of the plant. \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F, Supplemental Risk Manage"

This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2000 lbs) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a Chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected. \nUsing the Landview #6 simulator and the US Census 2000, it was identified that 8,600 residents are inside the 1.3 miles radio. It was used ALOHA to simulate and map the gas dispersion.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2000 lbs container, but throughout a pipe leak. In the alternative case the end point distance is calculated as 0.1 miles and no public receptor is identified over the most recent map according to the Landview/Us Census 2000, it was identified that 50 residents are inside the radius of 0.1 mile. \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually close to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facilities which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans. Different Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the Chlorine. List of all SOP are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the Chemical and also related to the Emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\nFive years Accident History:\n\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of 10 lbs has been reported during the last five years. \n\nPlanned Ch"

It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to Containers handling and transportation, employee\u00bfs training, preventive maintenance and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated 10/11/2007."
