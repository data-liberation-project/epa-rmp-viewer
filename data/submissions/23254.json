These substances are used in various\r\nprocesses throughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers. Substances that are used by\r\nAXCHEM that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part 68 are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:\r\n\r\n     Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent solution in water. \r\n     The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 56,000 pounds\r\n     (21,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances:\r\n\r\n     Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored as a 60 percent solution in \r\n     water.  The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is 57,000 \r\n     pounds (37,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenarios:\r\n\r\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios were\r\nevaluated and are discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst case scenarios are presented in the RMP\r\nfor one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternative scenarios were prepared for each\r\nof the toxic substances with worst case endpoints located offsite and for one flammable substance. \r\nThe endpoint represents the distance at which a released substance must travel before it disperses\r\nsufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \r\n\r\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\r\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\r\ndistance to a specifie"

The\r\nrelease is simply assumed to take place and the greatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly\r\nreleased.  The results of the worst case scenario analysis were as follows:\r\n\r\n          Toxic Substances: The formaldehyde storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently\r\nproduce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents.  The release was assumed to evaporate\r\nover a 10-minute time period.  The passive mitigation control of the tank dike were considered in\r\nlimiting the release impacts.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be less than 0.06\r\nmiles.  The release rate was calculated to be 0.01 pounds per minute.  However, a release rate of\r\n0.2 pounds per minute was entered into the RMP Submit document since this is the lowest value that\r\ncan be entered into the program.\r\n\r\n          Flammable Substances: The dimethylamine storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently \r\nproduce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents that results in a vapor cloud\r\nexplosion.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the release impacts.  The\r\ndistance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than 0.24 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect\r\npublic receptors. For formaldehyde the release was assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or\r\nrupture of a  transfer hose during unloading operations into a contained area.  For flammable\r\nmaterials, the alternative release scenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of\r\nthe uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. The durations for releasing these\r\nmaterials from a vessel/pipe for the alternative release scenarios were assumed to occur over a\r\n0.5-minute time period for bo"
