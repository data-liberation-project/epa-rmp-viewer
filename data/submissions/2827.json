      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Rome-Coosa Water Pollution Control Plant (Coosa WPCP) is a 2 MGD wastewater treatment facility, located at 650 Ausburn Road, Coosa, Georgia.  The Coosa WPCP is owed and operated by the City of Rome, Georgia and is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 68 (\"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\").  The Coosa WPCP utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater and stores chlorine above the EPA Threshold Quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The facility is subject to the \"Program 2\" requirements of the rule.  The facility employs the use of one-ton chorine cylinders that are trucked to the plant site.\n \nThe goal of the City's risk management program is to prevent accidental releases of chlorine and mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The program addresses specific actions the City will take to prevent accidental releases of chlorine into the atmosphere and reduce the potential impact on the public and the environment.  The specific actions include the development and implementation of a program containing the following key elements:\n\n* Off-site consequence analysis (Worst-case and Alternative scenarios)\n* 5-year accident history\n* A management system to oversee and implement the program\n* A Prevention Program that includes:\n* Chlorine safety information\n* Operating Procedures\n* Employee Training\n* Preventive Maintenance\n* Incident Investigation \n* Compliance Audits\n* An Emergency Response Plan\n\nAccidental release modeling was performed to determine the potential consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  Two accidental release scenarios where developed for the facility.  The \"Worst-case\" scenario assumes that the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder (2000 pounds) are released over a period of ten minutes (a scenario defined and required by EPA).  The \"Alternative\" scenario is site specific and considered more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The alternative scenario is determined by reviewing the accident histor"

The EPA's RMP*Comp program was used to determine the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint during releases.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Coosa WPCP assumes failure of a one-ton chlorine cylinder and the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine over a ten-minute period.  Using RMP*Comp and considering the Coosa WPCP's rural surroundings (terrain generally flat and unobstructed), the distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 3.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative, or more likely, release scenario was determined to be a complete break of the  inch I.D. pigtail that connects the cylinder to the manifold.  The release rate determined using RMP*Comp would be 20.9 pounds per minute.  Assuming that the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder would be released at this rate, the release would occur over a period of about 96 minutes.  The five-year accident history was considered in determining this scenario.\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint for the Coosa WPCP alternative scenario, assuming its rural terrain and the release of the complete contents of a one-ton cylinder over a 96 minute period, was calculated by RMP*Comp to be 0.2 miles (1,056 feet).\n\nThere were no receptors within the radius of the alternative (more likely) release scenario for the facility. Receptors for the Coosa WPCP worst-case scenario include1,460 persons, 537 residences, 2 schools, 1 medical facility, 1 recreation area, 17 businesses, 9 other public receptors, and no environmental receptors.\n\nThere were no reportable releases at the Coosa WPCP over the past five years.\n\nThe City of Rome has developed a Prevention Program that addresses basic, sound prevention practices.  Safety information includes general chlorine properties and hazards, a MSDS, a established maximum intended inventory of 4,000 pounds, safe upper and lower parameters for piping and equipment, and equipment specifications including the Codes and standards used to design, bu"

A hazard review checklist and what-if questions are used to assist in the hazard review process. Operational procedures for startup, shutdown, temporary, emergency, and normal operations have been developed.  A training program covering chlorine safety, responder notification, SCBA use, and operation procedures has been outlined and implemented.  The Prevention Program also includes preventive maintenance and incident investigation procedures, and a method of conducting compliance audits.\n\nThe City of Rome's senior management is strongly committed to safety.  The City of Rome's existing Loss Prevention Program requires that all accidents be reported as to the cause, and the corrective action taken to prevent future accidents.  Accidents are reviewed by the supervisor, safety officer and department head to ensure that all accidents are addressed appropriately.  Unsafe conditions reports are also available to all employees to ensure that all safety related matters, including chlorine, are given the highest priority. Any accident involving chlorine requires a chlorine specific investigation in addition to the requirements of the Loss Prevention Program.\n\nDuring the initial hazard review for the Coosa WPCP, only one major hazard was identified and promptly corrected.  Some flammable/combustible material (a partial bale of hay used for landscaping and a kerosene heater) was stored in the chlorine process area.  The material was immediately removed from the area.  Other items addressed in the hazard review included the need for warning signs, a wind sock, better labeling of equipment and controls, continued training in chlorine safety, and training to make sure that the recently written operational procedures are being implement properly.  Training has already begun and the signs and labels are expected to be "

A response to a chlorine release at the Coosa WPCP was previously developed by Rome-Floyd County Emergency Management Agency with the Rome-Floyd County Fire Department designated as the first responder.  The Coosa WPCP's emergency response has therefore, changed very little. The Rome-Floyd County Fire Department, once notified, shall coordinate all release mitigation procedures and public notification.  The risk management program includes a procedure to notify emergency responders, emergency response drills, and operator training.  Due to the remote location of the Coosa WPCP, there is also a chlorine leak kit on site to assist responders."
