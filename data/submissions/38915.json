In regards to the covered process there has been a capitol appropriations request submitted and approved to install an IR LEL system at the location of the tanks. The LEL system will be interlocked with our aerosol gashouses to automatically shut all gas sources off upon detecting a 10% LEL condition. In addition to shutting off flow, the LEL condition will also call for evacuation of the facility."
