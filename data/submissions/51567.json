TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in\nmanaging its unified river and power system for multiple public benefits, including the production\nof reliable, competitively priced power. TVA is committed to setting the standard for\nenvironmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee\nValley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management.\nTVA assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective\nenvironmental processes, and are held accountable for performance.\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with\nenvironmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their\nrespective duties. We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees\nand communities in which we operate through proper environmental review of new\ndevelopments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency\npreparedness. All activities will be conducted in accordance with current environmental and\nhealth and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThis affected facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility including two 18,000\ngallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, liquid transfer pumps, piping to\nconvey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a vapor, an\nammonia vapor transport line, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a\nselective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility ? anhydrous ammonia. With two 18,000\ngallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any\ntime is 162,000 pounds and the ma"

Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario(s), including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances to the end point for each\nreported scenario, were developed. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for\nthe facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp Model was used.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 18,000 gallon storage\ntank. A maximum release of 81,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period\nwas considered. The released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative\ncontrols. Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind\nspeed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite end point concentrations impacting populated\nareas.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario with the worst credible case offsite impact involves the\nrelease of 78,000 pounds of ammonia vapor loss from the failure of a pressure safety valve to\nreseat or from ruptured vapor piping. Under typical metrological conditions of Class D stability\nand 3 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite toxic end point levels.\n\nIV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information ? TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specification associated\nwith the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure\nthat hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The\nHazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the\npotential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel\nwith expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations. Findings resulting from\nthe analysis we"

TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting\nactivities within our covered process. The procedures cover various operational phases\nincluding initial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency\nshutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.\nThe information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the\nprocess and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining ? TVA?s training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all\npersonnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the\nsafe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the\nprocess. The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more\noften if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity ? TVA conducted well documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure safe and reliable operations. All process equipment routinely checked\nincludes storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and venting systems,\ncontrols and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices. All maintenance\noperations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have\nhad proper training. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected\npromptly and safely.\n\nManagement of Change ? TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process\nequipment, procedures, and monitoring technology assuring that changes meet regulatory\nrequirements. Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are\npromptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup saf"

Established pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction and\ninstallation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable\nfor a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in\nplace.\n\nCompliance Audits ? TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will\ndetermine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implements. The audits\nwill be conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the\naudits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\nIncident Investigations ? Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant\nrelease of a regulated substance is promptly investigated. Procedures ensure that\ninvestigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any\ncorrective actions to prevent the situation surrounding the release does not reoccur. All reports\nwill be retained for at least 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation ? TVA believes in a team approach to process safety management and\naccident prevention. Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to\nall information developed through implementation of the RMP, including information resulting\nfrom process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors ? TVA develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and\noperate generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities. Prior to\nselecting a contractor, TVA evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety\nperformance.

Emergency Response Plan\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous\nmaterials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including\nadequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local\nemergency response agencies and the public, the qualified contractor responder for postincident\ndecontamination of affected areas. The plan will be promptly updated to address any\npertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency\nresponse plan. In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep\nemployees, contractors, and local responders familiar with the plan.\n\nVII. Five-Year Update\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68, the Risk Management Programs for\nall TVA facilities are reviewed in detail prior to the five-year anniversary of the original\nsubmissions of the RMP. An audit was conducted March 13-15, 2007 for the purpose of\nrevalidating the Allen Fossil Plant RMP. Many of the dates provided in this submittal, referring\nto the most recent review of the various parts of the RMP program, coincide with this audit."
