It is the policy of West Point Mill to assure, so far as possible, that every employee has a safe and healthful place in which to work.  The West Point Mill is dedicated to providing the resources necessary to fulfill these commitments.  It is also the policy of the company to expect each employee, contract employee, and visitor to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety.\r\n\r\nIt is West Point Mill policy to ensure adequate emergency response capabilities exist to handle an on-site emergency involving RMP-covered chemicals.  The facility maintains an emergency response plan that addresses how to respond in the event of chemical releases.  The key is prevention.  The West Point Mill executes this policy through employee training, equipment purchases, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill is located along the northern bank of the Pamunkey River at 19th and Main Streets, in West Point, Virginia.  The facility history began in 1913 with the construction of a pioneer mill at the head of the York River.  In 1914, Chesapeake Pulp & Paper Company began making pulp, which was sold to other mills.   St. Laurent Paper Products Corporation purchased the West Point Mill in 1997.  In 2001, Stone Container Corporation purchased the West Point Mill from St. Laurent Paper Products Corporation. RockTenn purchased the company in 2011 and continues to operate the mill.\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill handles chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and aqueous ammonia (NH3), which are chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The Mill operates under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 2611 now recognized under the North American Industrial Classification System ("

In addition, these processes are subject to requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore the processes are subject to RMP Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide is manufactured on site for use in the bleach plant.  It is produced by combining sodium chlorate (NaClO3), methanol (CH3OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).  Sodium chlorate is reacted under certain conditions of acidity and temperature and with the addition of a reducing agent, chlorine dioxide is produced.  Mill production equipment can produce up to 25 tons per day of a 10 gram/liter chlorine dioxide solution, which is stored in three aboveground storage tanks.  These tanks have total capacities of 100,000 gallons, 120,000 gallons, and 145, 000 gallons.  Ammonia (aqueous, 29.5%) is purchased for use in the facility wastewater treatment plant.  Ammonia is delivered to the site via tanker truck.  The ammonia is stored in a 15,600-gallon tank, which is the maximum intended inventory of aqueous ammonia.  \r\nPollution Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill has a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, two Facility Response Plans, and Operations Manuals for Offloading Chemicals.  These plans outline the procedures in place at the mill to prevent pollution.  Prevention measures include training, inspections, integrity testing and engineering controls.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) relating to the covered processes is divided into three categories:  chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI relating to the hazards is included in material data safety sheets that are kept in readily-accessible locations for all employees.  PSI relating to the process technology is generally indicated on process drawings, and is referenced in application Oper"

PSI relating to process equipment is located in equipment files maintained by the Engineering and Maintenance Departments.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) will be conducted on each covered process every five years, or when the process changes.  PHAs for both the chlorine dioxide and ammonia processes were last re-evaluated in January - February 2012.  PHAs are conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at the minimum: operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.  PHAs address the hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents that had a likely potential for a catastrophic release, engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures are maintained by the Department responsible for the process.  Copies of the procedures are reviewed regularly by operations personnel, and are readily available on the facility Electronic Data Management System (EDMS). All Standard Operating Procedures and Policies relating to the facility Risk Management Program are available electronically on the EDMS.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill provides on-the-job and/or classroom training to employees responsible for operating the covered processes.  The trainees must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisor that they posses the skills and knowledge to perform the required duties prior to being assigned the responsibilities.  Hazard Communication and Chemical Training are provided to each operations employee.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill maintains written instructions for inspection and testing of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems (including valves), relief and vent system devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, alarms, and interlocks that are part of the covered processes.

Maintenance employees are trained on the acceptable work practices relating to the inspection and testing requirements.  Maintenance Procedures are housed in a database along with work orders.  Employees can generate work orders for repairs, inspection and testing.  Critical safety and environmental pieces of equipment are given top priority.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill has a management of change policy and guidance procedures to implement a review process when any component of the Process Safety Management system is modified, replaced or upgraded beyond replacement in kind components or design.  Quality control procedures reside on an electronic database available to operators and are tied into interlock protection mechanisms built into the process so operators can not willingly make changes to quality control operating procedures without prior approval.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill has a policy indicating the necessity to perform pre-startup safety reviews prior to implementing change in a covered system.  Documentation is in place to indicate a pre-startup safety review was completed prior startup of modified processes.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe West Point Mill last conducted a combined PSM/RMP audit in March 2009 and conducts a compliance audit of the RMP program at the West Point Mill at least every five years.  The audit consisted of a records review and evaluation of on-site conditions, which was performed by a third-party consulting company and certified/qualified auditors were used.  Since the West Point Mill is a Program 3 facility as defined by the RMP, the OSHA CPL 2-2.45a was used to assess the mill compliance to the PSM requirements.  The auditing checklist was modified to include those elements required for inclusion in the RMP.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigations\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation"
