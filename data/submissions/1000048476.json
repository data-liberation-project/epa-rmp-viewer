This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them. As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Plains facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nThe plant is a stabilizer with flammable liquid storage. The Plains Gardendale Stabilizer operates a variety of processes to recover natural gas liquids and sellable crude oil from condensate. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. The pressurized NGL tanks and the pressurized condensate storage tanks contain the regulated substance at the facility. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, ou"

      "SummaryText": "r worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the pressurized NGL (assumed to be propane) from one tank causing a vapor cloud explosion. In the case of the Plains Stabilizer Facility, this would involve one NGL tank. \r\n\r\nAn alternate release scenario is a loading hose breaking during NGL loading, with a release of NGL for 10 minutes. The loading process is a manned operations, but the alternative release scenario assumes another employee would locate the leak within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in La Salle County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Plains Gardendale Stabilizer Facility. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM. Since the facility is subject to Program Level 3 requirements, the overall prevention program is shown below:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Plains Gardendale Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. Plains Gardendale Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.)."

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: Gardendale has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Gardendale has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Plains Gardendale Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: Plains Gardendale Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Plains Gardendale Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Plains Gardendale Facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's finding are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Action Plan, which is linked with the La Salle County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan.

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors: Gardendale uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods for increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR): Plains Gardendale Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. Plains Gardendale Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Plains Gardendale Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the HAZOP technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Plains Gardendale Facility maintains written procedures that address"
