The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, yogurt, and milk products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Price\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s Creameries is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program, Price\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s Creameries has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. These programs include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tOperating Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tTraining\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tManagement of Change\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tPre-Startup Review\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tCompliance Audits\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tIncident Investigations\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tEmployee Participation\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6\tHot Work Permits\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00a6"

      "SummaryText": "Contractor Safety\n\n\nEmergency Response Information: As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 8-911 which will notify the El Paso County LEPC, POLICE OR SHERIFF DEPARTMENT. In addition, the El Paso County LEPC has included Price's Creameries in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive Year Accident History: Price's Creameries has had one accidental release in the last five years.  \n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Some developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. The facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
