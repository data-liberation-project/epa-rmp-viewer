      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nAltus Midstream NGL Pipeline LP (Altus) owns and operates a natural gas liquid storage facility, the NGL Loading Station in Reeves County, Texas. The storage facility is designed to receives and stores off-spec NGL, NGL (y-grade) and stabilized condensate from nearby processing plants before the products are routed to a pipeline. \r\n\r\nAltus has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe NGL Loading Station operates several vessels containing the following products: \r\n\r\n1. Off-Spec NGL\r\n2. NGL (Y-Grade)\r\n3. Stabilized Condensate\r\n\r\nThese substances can contain the following components:\r\n\r\na. Methane\r\nb. Ethane\r\nc. Propane\r\nd. Butane\r\ne. Isobutane\r\nf. Pentane\r\ng. Isopentane\r\nh. carbons larger than C5+\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nA. WORST CASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario associated with a release of flammable substance in Program Level 1 processes at the NGL Loading Station is a vapor cloud explosion involving the inventory of the one (1) 90,000-gallon NGL bullet tank and related piping containing 99,000 gallons (489,817 lbs) of the NGL (y-grade). The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.6 mile. No receptors have been identified within the endpoint radius.\r\n\r\nB. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nNGL Loading Station has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe storage facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical storage facility operations before they evacuate. Altus has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, Sheriff's Office, or similar) This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Altus conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for storage facility personnel."
