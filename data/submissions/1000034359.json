This operation continues to supply ammonia in both anhydrous and aqua states to the end user for agricultural soil fertilization means.  These products are loaded at the facility and delivered to the field for application.  All personal information, addresses, and telephone numbers were rechecked for applicability.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable spills or releases in the last five years, and no injuries or illnesses that were caused by ammonia products.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACCEDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility continues to be committed to following all applicable safety and reporting regulations for the storage and transport of ammonia products.  There is an emergency plan in place covering response to releases, and it is presented in annual emergency response training for all involved personnel.  \n\n\n\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nBoth scenarios were evaluated and remodeled using RMP comp.   The results were updated in the RMP document.\n\n\n\nUPDATES\n\nUpdates to the RMP were for the following reasons:  Updated amount for the maximum amount stored and worst case senario were recalculated to include both NH3 storage bottles as they are plumbed together and due to possible proximity four applicator tanks were calculated into the overall quantity as a single process by proximity.  The likely hood of the application equipment beeing involved is very low probabilty but the regulation states they should be included.\n\nThe Aqua tank has been changed and has a slightly different storage capacity so this amount was updated as well.  In addition there is a new environmental recepter located at the far end of the property; small RV park, this was considered into the population that would be effected.\n\n\n\n"
