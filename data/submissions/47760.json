An inadvertent release of chlorine to the atmosphere may reach public receptors surrounding the facility.  Chlorine is heavier than air and seeks low areas.  It appears as a greenish-yellow gas and impacts public health when inhaled above the toxic end point as defined within 40 CFR 68.22.\r\n\r\nEvanston Water Utility uses chlorine to treat raw water for public consumption.  The chlorine feed system is redundant and feeds chlorine from alternate cylinders through alternate piping in the event of a leak.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source is the treatment process.  Liquid chlorine in eight one-ton cylinders naturally vaporizes into the piping system.  The cylinders are mounted on load cells and are connected to a 1-inch steel pipe header with pigtails (3/8\u00bf tubing).  In response to the load cell when the cylinders are nearly empty, an automatic valve switches flow from four cylinders at a time.  The four cylinder valves are partially open, and at vapor pressure, deliver chlorine gas to the header and vacuum regulator.  Chlorine flows at vacuum pressure from the regulator into the chlorinator that meters and controls the flow and then flows into the ejectors.  The ejectors provide motive vacuum power for the chlorinating system and mix the chlorine gas with water to form a solution.\r\n\r\nAt any time, a total of 16 one-ton cylinders and four 150-pound cylinders may be stored in the chlorine building.  Maximum inventory is 32,600 pounds and exceeds EPA\u00bfs threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment\r\n\r\nFailing to control the hazard and exceeding the toxic end point, EPA requires that the facility provide an offsite hazard assessment by evaluating two release scenarios (worse case and alternate case) to determine the toxic end point.\r\n\r\nToxic end point is based on ERPG-2 concentrations developed by the American Industrial Hyg"

The ERPG-2 is a maximum air borne concentration in which is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.  The AIHA has identified chlorine\u00bfs toxic end point as three parts per million (3PPM) or 0.0087 mg/l.\r\n\r\nThe two release scenarios have been completed, but due to security concerns, the OCA data is not included in the executive summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention of Chlorine Release\r\n\r\nThe process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices of the Chlorine Institute and other applicable codes and standards of water treatment facilities.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, safe handling and operating procedures that we use, and training of our personnel.  Program 2 Prevention Program as described in 40 CFR part 68 is followed to accomplish these goals and will minimize the potential for an unplanned release of chlorine to the environment.  In the event that a chlorine release should occur, a dry absorbent chlorine scrubber has been installed on the storage room exhaust system.  This scrubber is activated by the chlorine leak alarm and designed to remove chlorine from the exhausted air to less than the toxic end point.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, no potential or actual accidental releases have occurred.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nDespite the Prevention Program, incidents may still occur.  An Emergency Response Program is required to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release, thereby protecting the public health and the environment.\r\n\r\nExcept for minor release, this facility relies on community emergency responders (Evan"
