Immediately after discovering a release of chlorine, HBCC personnel are instructed to notify the Fire Department for initial response and evacuate the facility to a staging location across the street to the southwest.

The Security Company notifies both HBCC and/or the Fire Department that a release may have occurred.  Estimated response time from the Fire Department is 10 minutes.  Response time for HBCC personnel during off-hours is estimated to be 30 to 90 minutes.  No chlorine releases have occurred at the facility.\n\nHBCC contracts with Premiere Chemical Management to provide any secondary response or proper abatement and disposition of hazardous materials and wastes generated in a release. \n\nThe facility is believed to be included in the written community emergency respopnse plan and was noted as so in Section 9.1a of RMP*Submit, but this could not be verified by the local community.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHBBC has made a number of changes to improve safety at the Logan Avenue facility during this RMP process.  The changes primarily include detailed reviews and updates of formal operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to address comments and recommended actions identified through the Process Hazard Assessment conducted for this RMP.  Planned changes include increased formal coordination with the San Diego Fire Department; quarterly drills to test the emergency response plan as it relates to chlorine and anhydrous ammonia; updating agreements with suppliers to coordinate on the mechanical integrity of chlorine cylinders in the event of damage or leaks; revisions to the testing methods for the automated gas detection system; and replacement and stabilizing of metal storage racks in the southwest end of the warehouse near the designated"

RMP*Comp calculates the distance to the toxic endpoint as 0.3 miles.  Public receptors occur within this distance as noted in text of the Public Document submitted to the AA.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for Chlorine Cylinder\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more credible scenarios that could result in a release affecting endpoints off-site.  The release scenario for chlorine was identified after conducting the Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) for this RMP.\n\nScenario:  The valve on a chlorine cylinder does not seat properly and leaks while in storage at the warehouse.  The continuous gas monitoring system detects the leak and sounds an alarm but there is no passive mitigation available. This release scenario affects no other cylinders.  Response time is assumed to be 30 minutes.  Urban topography is selected in the model. RMP*Comp standard windspeed and temperatures are applied.  RMP*Comp calculates the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.  Public receptors occur within this distance as noted in RMPSubmit.\n\n\nSummary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHBCC's release prevention program complies with Federal ARP, CalARP and, for chlorine, PSM requirements.  Because the regulated substances are pre-packaged and remain in original containers at all times under normal operations, HBCC's prevention program emphasizes thorough training for its employees in hazard communication; proper handling, transfer, and storage methods; and awareness level emergency response.

A gas detection system monitors the chlorine storage area continuously for concentrations from 0 to 5 parts per million.  The detection system is tested monthly. An audible alarm sounds during business hours and signals a central, off-site alarm facility during off-hours to initiate emergency response. \n\n\nSummary of 5-Year Accident History\n\nOn the basis of a review with the HBCC PHA team during preparation of this RMP, there have been no accidents or accidental releases involving the regulated substances in the last five years at the San Diego facility.\n\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nHBCC's San Diego facility has a written Hazardous Materials Business Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan is tested through simulated spill/leak/fire emergency response situations at least 3 to 4 times per year.  The plan designates an Emergency Coordinator (EC) and an alternate.  The EC has received 40-hour HAZWOPER training, however, the key roles of the EC are to initiate notification and evacuation procedures in the event of a release or fire.  The designated EC has worked at the Logan Avenue facility since 1967.  Other employees receive awareness level emergency response training, first aid, and hazard communication training.  Because the facility is a Non-responding site, employees are not trained to provide emergency health care but may administer basic first aid.  Emergency Response training for facility employees is scheduled to take place during third quarter 1999.\n\nThe facility uses a continuous gas detection system to monitor for concentrations from 0 to 5 parts per million in the designated chlorine storage area"

A passive chlorine gas detection system operates continuously at the designated chlorine cylinder storage area. \n\nHBCC's emergency response policy is contained in its current written Hazardous Materials Business Plan.  HBCC considers the Logan Avenue facility to be a non-responding facility under Section 2765.1 of CalARP and 40 CFR 68.90.  A designated Emergency Coordinator (EC) and an alternate initiate emergency notifications and evacuations.

The facility has operated safely here since 1967.  The NAICS code for this facility is 42269, Other Chemical and Allied Product Wholesalers.\n\nChlorine is a federally regulated substance subject to Program 3, Risk Management Plan requirements because it is covered under OSHA PSM requirements and a worst-case release scenario would reach a toxic endpoint off-site.  Anhydrous ammonia on-site is regulated under CalARP, Program 2, but not Federal Program 3 because quantities stored do not exceed the Federal threshold for the RMP or PSM programs.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine are inorganic toxic gases liquified under pressure and stored at ambient temperature at the San Diego facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is a stable, colorless gas or liquid with an extremely pungent odor.  Chlorine is a stable greenish-yellow gas or clear, amber-colored liquid with a suffocating, pungent, irritating odor.  The National Fire Protection Association ranks the health hazards of both substances as high.  Anhydrous ammonia has a very high autoignition temperature and is difficult to ignite.  Chlorine is non-flammable but many metals ignite in the presence of chlorine.  Nonetheless, both substances should be stored away from heat and ignition sources.\n\nPre-packaged chlorine cylinders are stored indoors at a designated location near the front warehouse door as required by the San Diego Fire Department.  The cylinders are stored upright, with cylinder caps and storage tags in place.  They are strapped or chained in place and are also restrained by a metal gate at the storage location.

The anhydrous storage area is signed for anhydrous ammonia and is also secured by a chain-link fence that is locked except for unloading and loading operations.  HBCC's City of Industry repackaging operations maintain these cylinders in proper condition.\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analyses Results\n\nHBCC assessed the quantity of regulated substances in the warehouse process by reviewing storage capacities, production information, and Tier 2 reports submitted annually under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Next, release scenarios were identified that reach a toxic endpoint off-site.  An endpoint is a concentration of the regulated substance listed by the Federal or State government to establish population zones that would be vulnerable to impacts from an accidental release of the substance.  HBCC used USEPA's RMP*Comp model as the method for determining distance to an endpoint and, in the worst-case scenario, for identifying which release from the facility would result in the greatest distance to a receptor.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario uses the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  As a result, HBCC selected a release of the chlorine gas from a cylinder as its worst-case.  Required default values for release duration, wind speed, and atmospheric stability class were used.  \n\nScenario:  A fusible plug on the chlorine gas cylinder fails resulting in complete evacuation of the tank.  There is no passive mitigation available. The scenario modeled involves the failure of fusible plug on a 150-pound chlorine cylinder.
