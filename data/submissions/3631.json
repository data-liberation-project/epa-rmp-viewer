The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.87 miles.\n\nb.

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.51 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and D Stability modeling parameters.

      "SummaryText": "John Taylor Fertilizers\nRoy Riegels Chemical Co., - Woodland Facility\n\n\n1.  Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Roy Riegels Chemical Co., - Woodland facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1785 East Beamer Street, Woodland, California, 95695 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 12,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 48,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 12,000-gallon and one 8,200-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 241,500 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  60,375 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 48,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity a"
