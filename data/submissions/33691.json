Poso) is required to comply with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, which requires facilities with acutely hazardous materials (AHM) or flammable materials over the regulatory threshold to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Mt. Poso stores up to 21,250 gallons (109,800 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia, an acutely hazardous material, on site at any given time.\n\nMt. Poso originally prepared a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) in 1989 pursuant to California regulations. The plant is operated in compliance with applicable industry standards, Cal-OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard and EPA?a Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nMt. Poso is committed to environmental compliance.  In addition to environment, health and safety (EH&S) policies and principles, Mt. Poso has also instituted a compliance assurance plan (CAP).  The CAP is a living compliance management document developed from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and ISO 140001 elements.  Through a system of schedules, monitoring regulatory requirements, audits, training, incentive/discipline programs, and record keeping, Mt. Poso ensures compliance and continuous improvement.\n\nThe Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company Environmental Policy Statement:\n\nMt. Poso Cogeneration Company is to conduct business in a manner that is lawful, compatible with the environment and conductive to the health and safety of employees, facilities and the community.\n\nMt.

Poso Cogeneration Company?s employees will be individually and collectively accountable for the execution of the EH&S Policy.\n? EH&S goals will be achieved through the prudent use of resources, and through communication, education, proactive management, assessment and action.\n\nRelative to compliance with the RMP program, Mt. Poso has a fifteen-year history of successful compliance with the California Risk Management Prevention Plan (RMPP), California Accidental Release Program (CalARP), and the Cal-OSHA PSM program.  Successful compliance has been a result of adherence to the above programs and future compliance is anticipated based on this formula.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMt. Poso facility is located north of Bakersfield approximately 5.25 miles east-southeast of the intersection of Highway 65 and Famoso Road. Mt Poso operates a nominally rated 49.9 megawatt, coal-fired, circulating fluidized bed, cogeneration facility, that provides steam for enhanced recovery of crude oil. Operation began in 1989.  Mt. Poso operations personnel perform the day-to-day operation.    \n\nAmmonia is used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions, which improves air quality.  The emissions control operations include storage and handling up to 21,250 gallons of anhydrous ammonia, a substance that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified as an acutely hazardous material.  The Federal and State of California governments have established a program for reducing the hazards associated with the storage and handling of such materials.  The program was initiated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Title III, Section 112(r) and codified in 40CFR Part 68.  The California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) pursuant to Sections 25531 through 25543.3 of the Health and Safety Code has additional reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulations.  As part of this program, Mt. Poso is required to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for its anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facilities.  In an RMP, a facility reviews its processes, equipment and procedures that are intended to reduce the likelihood or consequences of a release of an acutely hazardous material.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA PHA revalidation was conducted at the Mt. Poso facility on May 12, 2002 for the RMP/PSM process, using the ?Checklist? methodology.  The basic events, which could lead to potential off-site impacts, are corrosion failure, external event, and on-site accidents.  The worse-case and alternate release scenarios were developed from the PHA review.\n\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis involves two release scenarios: worst-case and an alternate release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario, according to the RMP Requirements, must consider a release that empties the content of the ammonia system in a ten-minute period.  This scenario does not take into account whether or not the release is probable.  The alternative release scenario is designed to investigate the worst-case release that could happen within the life time of the facility.  This scenario takes into account the combination of frequency and severity.\n\nThe maximum capacity of the ammonia storage tank is 25,000 gallons.  Written operating procedures and a high-level alarm prevent more than 21,250 gallons from being present in the 25,000-gallon tank, or 85 percent of maximum capacity.\n\nBoth the worst-case and alternate release scenarios were completed according to the EPA?s OCA Guidance using the Reference Tables.  The Reference Tables are tools used to determine the OCA and toxic endpoints required under the Risk Management Program rule published by the Environmental Protection Agency on July 20, 1996, which implements Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Both the OCA Guidance and Reference Tables are available "
