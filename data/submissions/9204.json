In fact, the Pedricktown PVC Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyVinyls' policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the Pedricktown PVC Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Pedricktown PVC Plant, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance (which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment) and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  OxyVinyls implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

In addition, OxyVinyls requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.  OxyVinyls' mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyVinyls' goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release, the Pedricktown PVC Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. OxyVinyls utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. OxyVinyls trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  OxyVinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to support the Pedricktown PVC Plant in assisting workers, their families and the public during and after all emergencies.  In addition, the Pedricktown facility has been an active member of the Salem County Hazardous Materials Advisory Council, one of the key reasons that this county was the first in the United States to have an approved Emergency Response plan in full compliance with the EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA).

The primary purpose of the OxyVinyls facility is to manufacture, store and ship PVC resin.  Vinyl chloride is delivered by railcar, to two large storage spheres, from other OxyVinyls sites located in Deer Park, TX or LaPorte, TX. The vinyl chloride is transferred from the spheres to charge tanks via pipeline; where it is then introduced into reactors.  In the reactor, vinyl chloride is polymerized to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin in a water slurry solution.  After drying, the PVC resin is then transferred and stored in silos until loaded into railcars, hopper trucks or bags for shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility and railcars comply with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. \n\n3.

The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 1.8 miles.\n\nIt is important to note that 0.14 mg/L is the concentration of ammonia that EPA believes someone could be exposed to for one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe Pedricktown PVC Plant is located in a rural section of Salem County, and it has been estimated that, in addition to the persons working in the industrial complex of BFGoodrich, Geon, OxyVinyls and Pedricktown Cogeneration Limited Partnership facilities, there are approximately 2,900 residents who live within the 1.80 miles of this very unlikely release. OxyVinyls is sharing all RMP information with these industrial sites and their employees, the same as if they were residential receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia is a failure of a pipeline in the refrigeration system that would cause the release of 1900 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period.
