The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) is 3.2 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\nThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 231,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  DMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Dimethylamine and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Ingredion employees, Evonik employees, Chemtura employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Air Liquide employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  Assuming the released DMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distiance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.50 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.  \r\n\r\nAlternate Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\r\nAlternate case scenarios were conducted for each regulated toxic chemical.  The individual scenarios are identi"

      "SummaryText": "Assuming the released DMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.08 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.  \r\n\r\nWe are using this alternate case release scenario information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nLonza Inc. complies with OSHAs PSM rule and EPA's RMP rule.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key feature of successful prevention programs including:\r\n  - Process Safety Information\r\n  - Process Hazard Analysis\r\n  - Training\r\n  - Mechanical Integrity\r\n  - Management of Change\r\n  - Pre-Startup Reviews\r\n  - Compliance Audits\r\n  - Incident Investigation\r\n  - Employee Participation\r\n  - Hot Work Permits\r\n  - Contractor Safety\r\n  - Site Security\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program all work together to assist our efforts to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our facility management and our employees are committed to safe work procedures defined by the prevention program.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidential chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five (5) years, we have not experienced an accidental release from covered processes that has resulted in either deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterings-in-place, property damage or environmental damage off site.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nOur emergency response program covers various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  We have written procedures and pre-plans"
