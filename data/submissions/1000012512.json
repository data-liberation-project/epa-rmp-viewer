      "SummaryText": "United Cooperative - South Beaver Dam\nCompliance Contact:  Larry Stensrud\nFacility Telephone:  (920) 887-1756\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management and employees of the South Beaver Dam facility are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State (Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Chapter Comm 43) and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility will respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the Beaver Dam Fire Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a farm cooperative.  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The existing tank at the facility was emptied, pipes disconnected and disassembled in the summer of 2004, but was re-piped and re-assembled in early 2006.  The second 18,000 gallon storage tank was moved to the facility in early 2006. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the stationary tanks at the facility is approximately 158,000 pounds stored in the two (2) 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  The facility presently maint"

The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the nurse tanks and applicator tanks is approximately 225,000 pounds.  Some of the nurse tanks and applicator tanks are located at the facility on a short-term basis, and may be temporarily transferred to different United Cooperative facilities.  This facility (i.e., the two storage tanks) is loaded by railcar and transport truck and may have up to six (6) railcars, disconnected from the locomotive, at the facility.  The railcars are primarily used during fertilizer manufacturing, but may also be used to fill the two storage tanks.  The maximum quantity stored in the six railcars is approximately 900,000 pounds.  Therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility is approximately 1,285,000 pounds. This will occur when all of the nurse tanks, the on-site storage tanks and six (6) railcars are at the maximum fill level of 85%.  The nurse tank filling procedure is performed by our own employees.\n\nUsually once a year, the facility brings in a contractor with a portable reactor to manufacture liquid fertilizer (10-34-0, ammonium phosphate solution).  Several different contractors have been used (and will be used), including Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC of Garden City, Kansas.  The liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in railcars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered in railcars and the most anhydrous ammonia railcars at the facility at any one time is six (6).  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenari"

The written procedures address the following:  technical basis of the proposed change; impact of change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and, authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n14) Pre-Startup Review:  When modification to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and, training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\n\n15) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \n\n16) Incident Investigation:  Management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydro"

      "SummaryText": "o:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railcar.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 150,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.19 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the railcar is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from a storage tank to a nurse tank.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.56 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations (Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Chapter Comm 43).  The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia (Program 2).
