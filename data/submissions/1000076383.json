The Risk Management Program Rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe Sharyland WSC Water Treatment Plant (WTP) No.3 falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine. The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation. Sharyland WSC personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Program Plan (ARPP) that contains the following required information.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nA hazards assessment that establishes the worst case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Subpart B).\r\n\r\nA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazards review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation (40 CFR Subpart C).\r\n\r\nAn emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\r\n\r\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the Sharyland WSC WTP No. 3.\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.

In the event of a release, plant staff will initially contact the City of Alton Fire Department then coordinate emergency efforts with the City of McAllen Fire Department. Plant staff will relay information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant gates. Plant staff will await the fire departments arrival to inform and update its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process. The plant regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 8 one-ton cylinders of chlorine at its facility stored inside the chemical building. This is above the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the EPA.\r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThree raw water pumps take suction from a terminal reservoir located at the water treatment plant site. From there, the water flows into a raw water structure where the pumps convey water into rapid mix chamber A and/or B then into splitter box A and/or B where the flow splits respectively into four identical treatment trains. Each treatment train consists of two flocculation chambers, two sedimentation basins and two mixed media filters. After the treatment trains, the water combines to supply a transfer clearwell. From the clearwell, three transfer pumps supply one, 2 MG ground storage tank. Five high service pumps take suction from the storage tanks to supply the distribution system.\r\n\r\nOn-site generated Chlorine Dioxide is applied after the raw water structure. Liquid Ammonium Sulfate is applied slightly after Chlorine Dioxide just before entering the rapid mix. Liquid Alum and Chlorine are applied in the rapid mix chamber before entering the splitter box. The chemical building at WTP 3 has an emergency chlorine gas scrubber system in case of an"

During this period, no accidental releases of chlorine have occurred.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Response Program involving the immediate plant evacuation once the City's Fire Department is called to implement response and repair to leaking chlorine gas. The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Plant operators are required to make multiple rounds of inspection specifically within 2 hours after a chlorine gas cylinder is put into initial use and consistently continue regular monitoring.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the designated Fire Department is trained to respond to the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant's evacuation plan and (3) a detailed description for the emergency responders' plan for handling such as an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe City of Alton Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and notify the City of McAllen Fire Department for additional assistance and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant's emergency.\r\n\r\nALWAYS IMPROVING SAFETY AWARENESS\r\n\r\nThe water treatment plant will continue to train plant personnel in chlorine safety procedures by attending classes and safety meetings. The use of safety personal protection equipment, PPE, (self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, clothing, etc.) shall always be emphasized."
