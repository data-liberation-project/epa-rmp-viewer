In addition to the PSM / RMP and CalARP Programs, U.S. Growers Cold Storage has implemented various safety programs including forklift, lockout / tagout and hot work procedures.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Growers Cold Storage facility is located on East Vernon Ave (North side) between Alameda and Santa Fe Ave., Vernon California . The facility consists of two main warehouses that use ammonia for refrigeration:  Areas 5 and 6, and an engine room. The facility occupies approximately 167,000 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process is a closed system that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The processes, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\r\n\r\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature; lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 1 inches Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 140 psig on the high pressure side.  \r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored on site is 10,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of ammonia.

These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Amonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, in particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigerating Systems.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds, nor have there been any injuries resulting from an ammonia release during the past five years (June 2009 - June 2014).\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.)\tTo save lives.\r\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\r\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.
