The Plan was previously revised in accordance with the requisite 5-year update, as well as to address additional data elements required to be included in all RMPs by June 21, 2004 per USEPA rule changes. The facility ceased storing regulated substances over threshold quantities and therefore submitted a Deregistration Notice on November 25, 2009. This resubmission is being filed as a result of the facility's operations review programs indicating that a regulated substance, peracetic acid, is now being stored above reporting threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nChicagoland Warehouse and Transportation, Inc. - Bridgeview is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as hazardous materials segregation procedures, material handling equipment maintenance, and employee training associated with storage of hazardous materials at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility:  Peracetic Acid.\n\n\n\nWe have varying inventories for this chemical.  Peracetic Acid is a component of several customer-packaged materials that we store in our warehouse.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for reported scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario incorporates 3,000 pounds a peracetic acid acid released on the loading dock on a hot day. There are no mitigation measures assumed in this scenario. The alternative release scenario assumes a forklift collision with the totes, which are stacked two-high. As a result, two of th"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program Level 3 and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nChicagoland Warehouse and Transportation, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards (MSDS) for the regulated substance.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducted a study to ensure that hazards associated with our warehousing process were identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis was Hazard and Operability Analysis, guide word format.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chicagoland Warehouse and Transportation, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as segregation and storage procedures, use of forklifts, loading and unloading, examination of damaged containers, labeling of containers, and bracing, stacking and handling damaged containers.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nChicagoland Warehouse and Transportation, Inc. has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on an yearly basis and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nChicagoland Warehouse and Transportation, Inc. performs maintenance checks on forklift equipment to ensure proper operations.
