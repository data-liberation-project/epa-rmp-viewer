      "SummaryText": "1. The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of AGP Corn Processing are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of natural gasoline. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at AGP Corn Processing is the production of ethyl alcohol from corn. Natural gasoline is used to denature the ethyl alcohol product. The maximum quantity of natural gasoline stored is 310,448 pounds. Natural gasoline contains butane, pentane, and isopentane.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n     a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank (310,448 pounds) and its complete vaporization within 10 minutes. The worst-case release also assumes that this vaporized gas is then ignited. The distance to the endpoint (point of 1.0 psi overpressure) is 0.54 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario is again the release of the total contents of the storage tank. However, the assumptions used in this case are more likely and result in a smaller quantity of flammable liquid being vaporized and contributing to the resulting explosion. The distance to the endpoint (point of 1.0 psi overpressure) is 0.27 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implementated the required provisions of the Program Level 2 RMP. This includes the development and implementation of safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. A hazard review has been conducted and training has been completed. Procedures for compliance audits and incident investigations have also been developed. The facility has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program and a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan that covers thi"

The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of natural gasoline in the past five years that;\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\n     - have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n     a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III ( EPCRA ).\n     c.  A Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan, in accordance with EPA regulations, 40 CFR 112.\n     d.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
