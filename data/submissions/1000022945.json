The safety and health of  all personnel  is important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility  of all associates in the facility.\n\nTo establish safety in the plant , the company has installed a safety management program. This program is designed to achieve maximum efficiency and safety within the facility.\n\nOne component of the safety program has been the development  and implementation  of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs that comply with OSHA\u00bfs PSM  (Process Safety Management) CFR1910.119 and EPA\u00bfs RMP (Risk Management Program) 40 CFR Part 68. The facility manager is responsible for management of the accidental release and safety programs.\n\nThe purpose of this program is to prevent the occurrence, minimize the consequences, of significant releases of  Anhydrous ammonia( as used in a refrigeration process) This plan also has secondary purposes to effectively reduce the potential  for fire, explosion, minimize storm damage and other catastrophic events.  Overall these programs will prevent accidental  releases, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\nB. Stationary source and substance used.\n\nThis  perishable facility is used for the  storage and distribution of refrigerated Produce, Dairy, and Meat products. This facility, for the purposes of refrigerating  the building, uses Anhydrous Ammonia ( cas # 7662-41-7)  as a refrigeration medium. This is a closed system and is not used  for process manufacturing. The total  charge for this system  is 17, 331 pounds.  Since  a remote possibility exists that  ammonia releases could occur, this system is regulated under OSHA PSM and EPA\u00bfS  RMP standard under program 3.\n\nThe refrigeration system cons"

These compressors supply refrigerant to the appropriate evaporator units located throughout the facility. Within the engine room of the facility  three storage vessels are used for  high temperature accumulation, Low temperature accumulation and  a receiver tank which accept the return flow from the  system. Condensing units on the roof  remove the heat  from the refrigerant  and return it to the receiver.\n\nC. \tSummary of Worst  Case and Alternate Case scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario is a release of pressurized Anhydrous Ammonia from the high pressure receiver, located in the engine room.\nThis release scenario is calculated to release 2988  pounds of liquid and vapor  over a ten (10) minute period. This scenario is based upon the unlikely  failure of the receiver vessel. The vessels total capacity is  5800 pounds, however, administrative controls are in place in the operation procedures to limit the vessel capacity to (50%)  fifty percent of total. Under worst case weather situations, and the vessel being located within the facility walls the ammonia vapor cloud could travel .99 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat or hazard to the public.\n\nThe worst case scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons\n1. \tEpa\u00bfs RMP off-site consequence analysis data was used, and is considered to be very conservative \n2. \tIndustry standard were followed in the design and construction of the facility\n3. \tPressure safety  valves are operational and in place on all vessels.\n4. \tFacility maintains it\u00bfs equipment  according to manufactures  specifications.\n5. \tTraining programs are in place to insure operation of and response to emergencies are handled properly.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is designed around the release of  1325 pounds  of high pressure liquid ammonia from a ruptured  \u00be \u00bf steel line.
