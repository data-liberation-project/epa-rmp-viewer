Rio Algom undertakes to act responsibly as steward of the resources in its charge, working for the well-being of its employees and communities in which it operates.  Rio Algom recognizes local communities as stakeholders and proactively engages with them in an effective process of consultation and communication.\n\nRio Algom Mining Corp.'s Smith Ranch Facility is located in the Powder River Basin in Converse County Wyoming.  The specific location of the site is in Section 36 of  T36N R74W; approximately 17 miles north of the town of Glenrock, WY.  The site is located in a rural setting with ranching as the sole economic base in the vicinity of the site.\n\nThe facility is a in-situ leach uranium mining facility that is extensively regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration, as well as the State of Department of Environmental Quality.  Commercial operations of the facility started in June of 1997 and is currently in full production  The sole regulated substance present on the site is anhydrous ammonia; which is utilized in the uranium production process.  Rio Algom's Smith Ranch facility has not any accidental releases during the last five years.\n\nThe facility emergency management program consists of a triad approach with each component reliant upon the others to ensure effective management of the program.  The first facet of the program involves operational and administrative controls associated with safe production at the facility.  This includes management commitment to safety, providing appropriate resources to ensure a safe and healthy work place.  Safety is the responsibility of all company managers, supervisors, and employees. "

      "SummaryText": " Management responsibilities include prevention of accidents and injuries through identification and elimination of causes and the promotion of a safety consciousness among employees.  Standard operating procedures have been developed for tasks that involve the use of chemicals specified within 40 CFR Part 68 that outline proper work practices while working with chemicals.\n\nAnother facet of the emergency management program is the development and implementation of emergency response procedures and policies for use in the event an unexpected situation occurs at the facility.  These procedures provide guidance to on-site personnel on appropriate emergency response actions as well as periodic inspection of the associated facilities.  These procedures include appropriate notification procedures with company, regulatory agencies, local emergency response teams, and the public.\n\nThe third facet of the plan is involving and informing regulatory agencies and potentially affected public communities of Rio Algom's operations in the Powder River Basin.  This occurs in several formats including on-site tours, presentations, and community appreciation events.\n\nThe primary method of accident prevention at the facility involves administrative controls.  These include employee safety training, limiting the total amount of regulated substance on site, utilization of time tested standard operating procedures, and an inspection program to identify potential deficiencies in the process.\n\nRio Algom's emergency response programs involve on-site personnel as well as the local emergency response programs available in the area.  Coordination with the medical facility is included in this program.  The facility maintains a chemical emergency response procedure that provides guidance to personnel in the event of an accidental release.  Semi-annual emergency fire drills are conducted, as well as annual safety training that includes chemical safety, accident prevention, emergency response communi"

      "SummaryText": "cations.   Company procedures establish the corporate offices as the official liaison for communications with regulatory agencies and the public.\n\nThe worst case scenario envisions the unlikely event of total tank failure resulting in the release of all tank contents in a 10 minute interval.  The sole regulated substance at Rio Algom's Smith Ranch facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Through administrative controls, a maximum of 15,500 pounds of product would be involved in this unlikely worst case scenario.\n\nUtilizing the RMP*Comp, Version 1.06 consequence analysis program in the worst case scenario mode and using site specific characteristics results in a distance to toxic endpoint of 2.2 miles.  The toxic endpoint specified within 40 CFR 68, Appendix A for anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.  Due to the rural setting of the facility, no public receptors are present within this distance.\n\nAs a result of the excellent safety performance record at the facility, Rio Algom is not anticipating any changes to the overall chemical safety management program established at the facility.  Training occurs at least annually or more frequent as dictated by job requirements on upcoming projects."
