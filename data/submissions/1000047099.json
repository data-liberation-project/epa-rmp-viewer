Prevention Program\r\nD. Five-Year Accident History\r\nE. Emergency Response Program\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n\r\nA. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nThe emergency response procedures are detailed in the Ryder Holland Logistic Center Emergency Action and Spill Prevention, Contingency and Countermeasure Plan. These manuals were designed to meet the following objectives: \r\n                                     \r\n1) To save lives.\r\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries. \r\n3) To protect the environment and the public.\r\n4) To minimize property damage. \r\n  \r\nThe Emergency Action and Spill Prevention, Contingency and Countermeasure Plan provides the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. All employees are trained in their specific roles when responding to an emergency. The manuals are kept in strategic locations throughout the facilities and are readily available to all employees. \r\n\r\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE  \r\n \r\n The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, interconnecting piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \r\n\r\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: low"

      "SummaryText": "ering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is latter removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from 5 hg on the low side to 150 psig on the high side. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process. \r\n\r\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 18,100 pounds. \r\n\r\nC. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\r\n\r\nIIAR Bulletin 107, A Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins@\r\n\r\nIIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum  Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System@\r\n\r\nIIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems \r\n\r\nIIAR, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System@ \r\n\r\nIn addition the Ryder Holland Logistic Center has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with CFR 29, 1910.119. This included an initial Process Hazard Analysis that is revalidated every five years. In addition, the facility has a Mechanical Integrity program that includes an Engineering Checklist for equipment inspections. \r\n\r\nD. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY    \r\n\r\nThere has been one reported release of ammonia at this facility over the last five years ( May 7, 2009 through October 17, 2014). The April 3, 2012 release was 250 pounds of Ammonia Gas that was contained in Freezer 17. There was onsite sheltering in place of employees, there was no off site evacuation or sheltering of employees, and no injuries were reported. \r\n\r\nE.

      "SummaryText": "measure Plan, also known as Emergency Response Plan. This plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuation. Notification and alarm procedures are outlined  in the ERP as well. The plan addresses training requirements for employees, including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators. Emergency response drills involving all facility personnel are performed on an annual basis. This ensures that employees are familiar with evacuation routes from the facility and employee roles. \r\n\r\nF. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous changes to the facility to improve process chemical safety as a result of PSM and RMP implementation. Ryder Holland Logistic Center will maintain PSM /RMP programs for continued process safety improvement. This will be accomplished through audits, PHA revalidations, training, mechanical integrity testing and inspections. The facility is in the process of inspecting all piping, and painting pipes where needed. Ryder Holland Logistic Center has recently replaced all evaporators along with their associated piping that were in Freezers 16 and 17. Along with adding ammonia detection and mitigation programing in the cooler and freezers, to alarm and control a potential release. The facility in the future plans on replacing an evaporator that is in the cooler, also in plans are to add lighting to the roof valve groups and piping mains."
