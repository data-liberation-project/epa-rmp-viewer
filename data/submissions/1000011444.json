The emergency response policy is to immediately notify the St. Martin Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness through 911.\n\nThis facility is a water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of water with two chlorine cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine by weight.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances of two (1) ton cylinder of chlorine (4,ooo pounds total).\n\nThe worst case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel without administrative controls or mitigation measures to limit the volume or reduce the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThis facility has one worst case release scenario which involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest chlorine cylinder when full (2,000 lbs total).  This scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 3.0 miles and an affected population of 9,200 people. There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severity or range of the release.  \n\nThis facility has an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves a puncture of the largest diameter chlorine cylinder when full.  The scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 0.8 miles.  Section 3.2 of this RMP shows the calculations used for this scenario and an affected population of 960 people. There are no active or passive mitigation measures in place at the facility.\n\nProper training and certification of operators helps to prevent accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\nThere have been no reportabl"
