EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155                                                                        \nMontco Research Products, Inc. (Montco) operates its plant at 209 Janice Drive, P.O. Box 235, Hollister, FL  32147.  The plant has quantities of a regulated hazardous chemical, anhydrous hydrogen chloride (CAS # 7647-01-0), above the 6,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold.  Montco has a unified Risk Management Program (RMP) as it is also subject to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM).  \n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nMontco Research Products, Inc. prevents accidental releases through on the job training of operating personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the hydrogen chloride gas injection system.  The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.  The plant program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A) (1)\nMontco has a management system in place which is lead by the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nMontco maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT MONTCO RESEARCH PRODUCTS INC., FLORIDA SITE (B)  \nMontco employs 10 full-time and one part time employee engaged in plant operations.  Hydrogen chloride is a raw ingredient used as part of the chemical manufacturing process.\n1.5.    SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)    \nThe site is owned and operated by Montco and is managed Montco staff.  The site is located at 209 Janice Drive, P.O. Box 235, Hollister, Putnam County, Florida.   The 100 acre site is located at the end of Janice Drive.\nThe Plant includes a separate anhydrous hydrogen chloride storage area.\nThe boundaries of the hydrogen chloride system subject to the RMP, and like PSM, regulation include the Bulk Hydrogen Chloride Storage, Feed Control system associated vent makeup, exhaust systems, hydrogen chloride scrubber and hydrogen chloride injection cabinets at the injection point of the product reactor/distillation units.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.6.    MONTCO RESEARCH PRODUCTS AND ANHYDROUS HYDROGEN CHLORIDE\nMontco uses hydrogen chloride gas in a reaction/distillation process in order to produce 1-Chloromethylnapthalene and Ethyl Benzyl Chloride.  A maximum quantity of 42,000 lbs. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is stored on site in two compressed gas tube trailers.  Each trailer contains seven tubes with a capacity of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of hydrogen chloride gas from the system.\n2.

In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of hydrogen chloride was determined, and sensitive receptors such as residences were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the hydrogen chloride system.\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two hydrogen chloride release scenarios.  The first is a A?worst case releaseA?.  The second is a more probable A?alternative release scenarioA?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that A?the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutesA? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarioA?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen chloride released before its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpoint.A?  The EPA specified endpoint for hydrogen chloride is 0.030 mg/l.  The endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individualA?s ability to take protective action.A?

The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is 636 individuals based on the U. S. Census 2000 demographic data.  There are 242 residences and no other receptors included in that release area.\n2.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the wip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03 square inch hole in the wip tube, a pipe, or even the container itself.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPAA?s water guidance demonstrated the rate of hydrogen chloride release is 100.0 lb. /minutes for a period of 30 minutes releasing a total of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.50 miles containing 0.80 square miles and is in the process safety information.  The residential population that would be impacted by this release is 299 individuals and is recorded in the process safety information.  Receptors in this area were identified as 112 local residences adjacent to the plant.\n3.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\nMontcoA?s accidental release prevention program is based on OSHAA?s PSM program and EPAA?s RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall plant-wide program and the site-specific program.  The second is the hydrogen chloride specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Palatka Fire Rescue/HazMat Team and Putnam CountyA?s Fire/Rescue Department and the Regional LEPC.\n3.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTI"
