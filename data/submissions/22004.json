To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health safety, and environmental issues.\nIn the Borden Chemical, Inc. Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases. \nIncluded in the Safety Manual is Emergency Response Polices that states that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant is a fully integrated facility which makes phenol-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, formaldehyde solutions, and petroleum wax emulsions.  Formaldehyde has a wide variety of uses as a feedstock for many chemical products as well as the resins that we produce onsite.  Aqua ammonia is also used as a raw material for certain resins.  The resins are primarily used in manufacture of forest products such as particleboard, medium density fiberboard, plywood and oriented strand board.  Other resin uses include other building products such as fiberglass roofing shingles and fiberglass insulation.\n\n3. Worst-Case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Formaldehyde \n\nTemperature controls fail while making a batch of phenol-formaldehyde resin.  As a result, the heat of reaction boils the reacto"

Pressure inside the reactor forces vapor and liquid through the rupture disc vent piping, discharging water vapor, formaldehyde vapor, and liquid resin into the atmosphere.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/m3 is 1.6 miles.  The duration of the exposure is seven minutes.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Formaldehyde\n\nAs a result of a bottom unloading valve failure, 25,000 gallons of formaldehyde spills from a rail car, which is waiting to be shipped.  This formaldehyde flows via a concrete ditch into a containment pit, from which it can be pumped to a storage tank. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.12 mg/m3 is 0.17 miles.  Due to the low odor threshold of formaldehyde, the spill would be quickly discovered.\n \nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Aqua Ammonia\n\nThe bulk storage tank of aqua ammonia fails, and spills its entire contents within the diked containment area, from which it can be pumped into a storage tank or trucks.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.014 mg/m3 is 2.0 miles.  The duration of exposure is ten minutes.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario \u00bf Aqua Ammonia\n\nAs a result of piping failure, the contents of a full truckload of aqua ammonia (50,000 pounds) is spilled into the truck containment area, from which it can be pumped to a storage tank..  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.014 mg/m3 is 0.2 miles.  The duration of exposure is 50 minutes.\n\n4. Accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of"

The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\nProcess Stewards are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operation procedures up-to-date; training operating technicians so they can safely follow theses procedures; assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis; and, when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit. All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, equipment information, process safety information, mechanical integrity information, and a training certification program. Operating technicians use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains their actions prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that prevent a release. As a result of initial process hazard reviews, a significant investment was made in process control systems.  Several control interlocks are installed to insure safety, including an automatic deluge system for phenolic resin production. Should a batch become unstable, this system floods the reactor with water, diluting the reactants while removing excess heat.  It operates either automatically based on control system monitoring of the process, or manually by the technician.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. For equipment and procedure changes, the Management of Change System in Lotus Notes initiates a safety review. New capital equipment is reviewed as part of the Investment Proposal system.  This review may include a process ha"

Training is then performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact. In addition, Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up and operated safely after a significant change is made.\n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical \nintegrity of process \nequipment. A computer database is used to manage the preventive \nmaintenance schedule.  Periodically, scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure, and may include weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly inspections and maintenance.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices \nwhich prevent \naccidental releases. One important section describes safety \nmeasures for welding or other \n\"hot\" work, which includes a Hot Work Permit system to reduce the risk of \nfire. The Safety Manual \nalso includes requirements for locking out and tagging out equipment for \nmaintenance. These procedures \nreduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a \nrelease.\n\nContractors who perform work in the plant are \ngiven safety orientations on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor \nsafety programs and \nperformance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that \nimpact process safety using the Contractor Screening Form.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are \ninvestigated and their root cause determined.

      "SummaryText": "am.  Addressing recommendations from this audit keeps the safety program effective.\n\n5. Five-year accident history\nThere has been one spill at the plant which resulted in a release of formaldehyde off of the plant site in excess of the reportable quantity.  This occurred in 1996 at the formaldehyde rail car loading area.  Investigation revealed that the top flange on a cartridge filter was not tightened sufficiently, allowing formaldehyde solution to spray onto a gravel area adjacent to the rail car area.\nAs a result, lids are used which fit over the top flange of the filters, so that if there is a leak it is deflected downward and retained in the concrete diked area.\nThere have been no incidents involving ammonia.\n\n\n6.  Emergency response program\n\nThe plant operating staff is trained in Hazard Communication, First Aid, and fire prevention as a part of Borden's Safety Program.  In addition, Borden has a contractual agreement with Cusa Environmental, Inc., to provide a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team should an upset condition exceed the capabilities of plant personnel. This team is available on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis.\n\n\n.  \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\nNo changes are planned at this time."
