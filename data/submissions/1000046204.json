Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Though unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are coordinated with the Albany Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements is, 36,186 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by EPA Regulation 40 CFR Part 68. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to OSHA PSM Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular five year intervals. Any findings related to the hazard anal"

These procedures address various models of operation; such as, initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who operate the processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nWe carry out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations, with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWe have written procedures in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given training to deal with the modifications.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review:\n\n\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. These reviews are conducted to "

These audits are conducted at least every three years, and any corrective actions required as a result of these audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading up to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nIn our facility the process of safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements to the Plant engineering Manager. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our implementation of the RMP Rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\n\n\nOn occasion, we hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known and potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been one reportable accidents or incidents at this facility during the past 5 years.  \n\n\n\n5.
