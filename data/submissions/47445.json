      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the APCI Escambia Plant liquid hydrogen is stored.  Some of the compounds handled are considered hazardous by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  We insist on strict adherence to safety precautions developed to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health, as well as the safety and health of our coworkers and minimize the threat to our community and the environment.  Our safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the proper maintenance of the safety systems designed in these facilities, the procedures used by our personnel and the training of these personnel.  \n\nOur safety programs are modeled after the ACC?s Codes of Responsible Care.  Our emergency response plan, which is based on OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation, contains procedures for notification of the local Emergency Management Authority, local fire department, and potentially affected neighbors.  Neighbor notification can take the form of an automated telephone ring down system, sponsored by local industry.  The telephone system is augmented by a network of sirens surrounding the plant site, which can be activated by either Emergency Management or Plant ersonnel.                                                                            \nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility stores and ships liquid hydrogen. \n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility is hydrogen which is labelled as a \"Flammable Substance\" by EPA.\n\nThe General Accident Prevention Program and Specific Program Steps\n\n    The facility developed prevention program el"

      "SummaryText": "ements based on the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes. \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n    Within the past five years there have been zero incidents that would be reported under RMP.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n APCI contracts Emergency Response services from Taminco Methylamines Inc. which shares the site with APCI.    The site's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. All employees have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The site also has a fire and emergency services crew, who are trained to the HAZMAT Technician or HAZMAT Specialist levels of the OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. All employees receive annual refresher training in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management Agency and the Pace Volunteer Fire Department. Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency plans. The last drill was held with the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management Agency on 10/28/2004. Monthly planning and communications meetings are held with the Santa Rosa County EMA.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlant hazards reviews, risk analyses or incident reviews are among the systems we rely on to drive safety improvements. At this time there are no major administrative, operational, process of equipment changes planned for the Liquid Hydrogen Storage facility."
