Carpenter Co. is located in Fogelsville, PA, south of Route 78 and East of Route 100 and is surrounded by an industrial neighborhood.  The facility is located on 35 acres.\n\nCarpenter Co. manufactures polyurethane foam products primarily for use in furniture, cushioning, bedding, undercarpet padding, and packaging.  The manufacturing process incorporates the use of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  Inside the building, up to 375,000 pounds of TDI is stored in three steel storage tanks.  The tanks are located in a cement pit that can contain 62,000 gallons.  TDI is shipped primarily via railcar, which contains approximately 190,000 lbs.

The diked area is large enough to contain a full railcar.  The endpoint distance is equal to 95 feet.  The nearest fence line is 171 feet away.  A worst case spill would remain onsite.  No alternative release scenario is required for the Program Level 1 covered process.\n\n4.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nTo prevent an accidental release, the following are implemented:\na.    Procedural\n1.
