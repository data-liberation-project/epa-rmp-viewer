Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period and knowledge is determined by verbal and written test. Management follows a yearly schedule issuing course work on a weekly basis to the facility manager. Classes are held at the facility on a weekly basis for one to two hours. Attendance is mandatory for all employees including drivers and warehouse personnel and the Operations Director verifies attendance.\n\nNew employees are required to receive an extensive orientation to the operating procedures for each phase of the operation including material handling equipment, transportation vehicle loading and unloading, transportation equipment operations, liquid material transfers, personal protection, hazard recognition and safe work practices.\n\nEmployees not having worked in a process receive an introduction by thorough procedural documentation review and pairing the employee with a person familiar with the process for an unspecified period. Management within the guidelines of the program verifies competency of safe operating practices.\n\nThe company provides training according to the following regulatory and association requirements:\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n\nHazardous Waste Operations\nWorker Right-To-Know laws\nPowered Industrial Trucks\nMaterial Handling and Storage\nHazardous Materials\nToxic and Hazardous Substances\nPersonal Protection Equipment\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nChemical Accident Prevention\nSolid Waste Management Guidelines\nStandards for Hazardous Waste Generators\nSuperfund, Emergency Planning and Community Right-To"

The vehicles are maintained according to a strict schedule by a company with a strong reputation in transportation equipment maintenance.\n\nAll portable tanks, know as tote tanks, are designed for and dedicated to specific products. Each container is inspected before filling using a systematic approach to verify that each and every component is in suitable condition.\n\nMaterial handling equipment such as fork lifts are inspected daily and each unit receives periodic maintenance according to a schedule. All equipment used in the handling of material are routinely inspected for defects and promptly removed from service when found defective.\n\nThe loading and unloading areas for transport vehicles are on concrete surfaces. A release occurring during the loading or unloading of packages can be contained to this area.\n\nMaterials stored within buildings are located in areas specific to their hazard class to prevent one group of hazard class from impacting another during an incident.\n\nAll buildings are constru"
