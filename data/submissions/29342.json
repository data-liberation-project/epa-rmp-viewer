Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at ConAgra Foods ? Food Service Company (ConAgra) for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including:\n?    Introduction;\n?    ConAgra policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n?    Hazard Assessment;\n?    Prevention Program;\n?    Five-Year Accident History;\n?    Emergency Response Plan; \n?    Emergency Communications;\n?    Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n?    Planned changes to improve safety; and\n?    Management Program\n\nII.    ConAgra?s Policies To Protect Health, Environment and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at ConAgra; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. ConAgra is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is ConAgra?s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility?s Emergency Response Pl"

      "SummaryText": "an (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a listed toxic substance, it is also a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125 Exemptions ? Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68).\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\nThe ConAgra facility is located at 4530 Mobile Highway in Montgomery, Alabama. The plant is a beef processor (meat grinder) and a ready-to-eat poultry facility.  The final products produced include hamburger patties and ready-to-eat poultry. The facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two refrigeration systems onsite: the House System (System 1) and the Frigo System (System 2). The amount of ammonia present in the House refrigeration system is approximately 51,000 pounds, and the amount of ammonia present in the Frigo system is 14,000 pounds. The entire amount of ammonia in both systems is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nThe House System has a high-pressure receiver that is located outside.  It is administratively controlled to hold 50-60% of the vessel?s capacity. The high-pressure receiver tank is not located near any other processes.  A high temperature recirculator vessel is also located outside near the high-pressure receiver.  It is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 80% of its capacity. This high temperature recirculator tank is not located near any other processes. \n\nThe Frigo system is a critical charge system and has no high-pressure receiver. Most of the ammonia in this system is contained in the intercooler, thermal siphon receiver and the accumulator, which are all located inside of a building.  The Intercooler can hold 80% of the"

Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\nWhile a catastrophic release is not expected to occur, as required by the Rule, Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios were evaluated to estimate the potential offsite consequences (i.e., offsite consequence analysis (OCA)) to the public or the environment from the potential accidental release of ammonia. \n\nPursuant to the Rule, ?the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity? was used. \n\nThe worst-case toxic accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of the high temperature (approximately 26 psig and 12?F) ammonia recirculator, which is located outside and is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 12,600 pounds (80-percent vessel capacity). \n\nAnother worst-case toxic accidental release scenario was considered and is described as follows. The outside high pressure receiver (approximately 170 psig and 95?F) was evaluated.  It is larger than the high temperature ammonia receiver, but is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 10,050 pounds (60-percent vessel capacity). It is located near the high temperature receiver, and both vessels are located approximately the same distance to the plant?s property boundary.\n\nThe intercooler in System 2 is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 11,000 pounds of ammonia.  It has a temperature of 50?F and is maintained at 80 psig.  It is located inside of the building - the high-pressure receiver (for System 1) is located outside of the building along the same wall. \n\n Worse case offsite consequence analyses were calculated for these three vessels.\n\n EPA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (EPA 550-B-00-006, May 2000) Exhibit 4-4, shows that under a worst-case release scenario for the high temperature ammonia recirculator ? whereby the entire 12,600 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute perio"

Under a worst-case release scenario for the high-pressure ammonia receiver ? whereby the entire 10,050 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute period, the toxic endpoint distance is 1.2 miles. Under a worst-case release scenario for the intercooler ? whereby the entire 11,000 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute period, the toxic endpoint distance is 0.9 miles. \n\nSince all three vessels are located near each other and are at the same approximate distance to the plant?s property boundary, the receptors are the same.  A release from the high temperature recirculator was selected as the worse case scenario as it contains the largest quantity of ammonia. The worst-case scenario for the high temperature recirculator encompasses all receptors affected by the worst-case scenarios for the vessels holding smaller quantities of ammonia.\n\nThe ERPG-2 airborne toxic endpoint concentration of 200 parts per million (ppm) or 0.14 mg/L is the maximum which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action. Based upon year 2000 census data, the population within a radius of 1.5 miles is insert 5,573.\n\nIt should be noted that the worst-case scenario is an extremely unlikely event especially since most of the time, the ammonia is distributed within the piping of many refrigeration subsystems within the facility building ? and is not contained within this large vessel.\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment ? Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAn ARS was modeled for ammonia in the hazard assessment and assumes that a leak occurs in a pipe joint or weld. ?Guidance average? weather conditions including 3 meters per second wind speed and a D stability class at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C were used.

Using a conservative pressure of 180 pounds per square inch (gauge) with a hole-diameter of up to 0.37 inches, the continuous release rate would be 300 pounds per minute, which would result in a 200-ppm toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles (Guidance Tables: Exhibits 4-5 and 4-6) in this urban setting. No mitigation measures were considered.\n\nA small population group may be affected by the ARS due to the close proximity of commercial/office areas to the facility; however, the LandView Census estimator did not indicate any offsite receptors.\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. Hygieneering, Inc. (Hygieneering) conducted an audit of the PSM program on February 28, 2003.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n?    Employee Participation ? ConAgra has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at ConAgra have assisted in developing the initial PHA for the ammonia process as well as updating and revalidating the PHA every five years.
