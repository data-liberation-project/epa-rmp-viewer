The plant is a beef processor (meat grinder) and a ready-to-eat poultry facility.  The final products produced include hamburger patties and ready-to-eat poultry. The facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two refrigeration systems onsite: the House System (System 1) and the Frigo System (System 2). The amount of ammonia present in the House refrigeration system is approximately 51,000 pounds, and the amount of ammonia present in the Frigo system is 14,000 pounds. The entire amount of ammonia in both systems is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nThe House System has a high-pressure receiver that is located outside.  It is administratively controlled to hold 50-60% of the vessel\u00bfs capacity. The high-pressure receiver tank is not located near any other processes.  A high temperature recirculator vessel is also located outside near the high-pressure receiver.  It is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 80% of its capacity. This high temperature recirculator tank is not located near any other processes. \n\nThe Frigo system is a critical charge system and has no high-pressure receiver.

The outside high pressure receiver (approximately 170 psig and 95\u00b0F) was evaluated.  It is larger than the high temperature ammonia receiver, but is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 10,050 pounds (60-percent vessel capacity). It is located near the high temperature receiver, and both vessels are located approximately the same distance to the plant\u00bfs property boundary.\n\nThe intercooler in System 2 is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 11,000 pounds of ammonia.  It has a temperature of 50\u00baF and is maintained at 80 psig.  It is located inside of the building - the high-pressure receiver (for System 1) is located outside of the building along the same wall. \n\n Worse case offsite consequence analyses were calculated for these three vessels.\n\n EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (EPA 550-B-00-006, May 2000) Exhibit 4-4, shows that under a worst-case release scenario for the high temperature ammonia recirculator \u00bf whereby the entire 12,600 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute perio"

Under a worst-case release scenario for the high-pressure ammonia receiver \u00bf whereby the entire 10,050 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute period, the toxic endpoint distance is 1.2 miles. Under a worst-case release scenario for the intercooler \u00bf whereby the entire 11,000 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute period, the toxic endpoint distance is 0.9 miles. \n\nSince all three vessels are located near each other and are at the same approximate distance to the plant\u00bfs property boundary, the receptors are the same.  A release from the high temperature recirculator was selected as the worse case scenario as it contains the largest quantity of ammonia. The worst-case scenario for the high temperature recirculator encompasses all receptors affected by the worst-case scenarios for the vessels holding smaller quantities of ammonia.\n\nThe ERPG-2 airborne toxic endpoint concentration of 200 parts per million (ppm) or 0.14 mg/L is the maximum which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include safety interlocks/alarms to prevent ammonia (1) overfilling (flooding) of various subsystem vessels; and (2) over-pressurization, whereby control valves fail \u00bfopen\u00bf to reduce and distribute system pressure. An ammonia detection sensor exists in the engine rooms for both of the ammonia systems.\n\nConAgra has a security surveillance program in place to deter theft, vandalism, and terrorism.\n\nVII..\tFive-Year Accident History\nBased on discussions with plant personnel and review of available file information, the ConAgra Foods \u00bf Foods Service Company facility (formerly, ConAgra - S & C Beef Processors Plant) has not had any accidental anhydrous ammonia releases, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years. \n\nVIII.\tEmergency Response Program\nConAgra has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), updated on January 1, 2004, to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.

The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the emergency coordinators, communication coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant will be included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Montgomery City / Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee. ConAgra Foods also coordinates with the City of Montgomery Fire Department on emergency response activities. \n\nThe facility has a windsock present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nResponders receive Hazwoper training through classroom instruction, on the job training and drills. Hazwoper training includes first responder awareness levels, first responder operations level, and hazardous materials technician training. Responder HAZWOPER training also includes procedures for using and maintaining emergency response equipment as required.\n\nThe facility's Onsite Incident Commander (Plant Manger) is responsible for notifying onsite emergency response personnel, emergency response contractors and local, state and federal agencies of releases. The Environmental Regulatory Supervisor is responsible for submitting written communication concerning releases to local, state and federal agencies.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs Evacuation Coordinator is responsible for coordinating site evacuation in the event of a release that requires evacuation.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan is maintained onsite as part of the Risk Management Program."
