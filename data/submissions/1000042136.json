Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CHATTANOOGA FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different  containers for distribution to customers.  Chlorine is also used in the production of Sodium Hypochlorite.  Chlorine related processes are Prevention Program Level 3.  Sulfur Dioxide is received prepackaged in different containers.  Sulfur dioxide storage, warehousing and distribution activities are Prevention Program 2.  Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide containers are used only for resell to our customers.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,080,000 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is present at our facility at 50,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe facility now intends to store, warehouse and distribute prepackaged containers of Ammonium Hydroxide in amounts that exceed the regulated threshold quantity.  Thus, this substance is hereby added to this submission.  Activities related "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is WHAT IF the studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are op"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.
