Each metal cylinder and ton container has a steel valve protection cap, which covers the vessel valve or valves.  These steel protective caps are never removed from a container unless the container is being filled.  The warehouse where the chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are stored is a concrete building with a metal roof.  A fire suppression system is present in the building, which consists of automatic sprinklers that are activated in case of a fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history (April 2011 to April 2016) for the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix facility is continually evaluating ways to improve safety at the site.
