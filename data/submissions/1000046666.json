As part of this commitment, GP/Crossett has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at GP/Crossett.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n\n\n A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine)  see topic 1.2\n\n\n\n A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) see topic 1.4\n\n\n\n An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes  see topic 1.6\n\n\n\n A management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it "

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\n \n\nGP/Crossett minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nGP/Crossett limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the facility works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety programs at GP/Crossett consist of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGP/Crossett is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and co"

GP/Crossett provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Crossett Paper Operations.\n\n \n\n1.2 Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations and Our Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGP/Crossett is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp.  The facility also stores and transfers chlorine (Cl2) for water treatment in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP Rule.  The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.  The Chlorine System consists of twenty six 1- ton cylinders for water treatment at the facility.  The chlorine system is also an RMP Program level 3 covered process.\n\n\n\n1.3 Off - Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nGP/Crossett performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Crossett and, (2) would result in an off- site consequence if the release occurred.  These alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee "

EPA has provided a modeling program (RMP*Comp) to determine the endpoints.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations.  These requirements include:\n\n\n\n One worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Crossett Operations has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System and the Chlorine System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well.
