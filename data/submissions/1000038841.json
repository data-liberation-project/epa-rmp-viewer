The programs involve a range of senior management personnel.  Additionally, NHK conducts regular safety meetings and training involving all levels of personnel.  NHK's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans.  NHK's corporate policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively (or engage an emergency response contractor) should an accident occur. \n\n     \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNHK maintains two 9,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) for storage of isocyanates [one AST for MDI (not subject to RMP) and one AST for TDI].  The ASTs are located in an enclosed area of the manufacturing facility consisting of a concrete secondary containment structure designed to hold the contents of the ASTs.\n\n    \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nNHK utilizes a system of daily visual inspections and a preventative maintenance program to prevent accidental releases.  Engineering/operations personnel conduct daily inspections of the foam line system to ensure proper operation while maintenance personnel inspect the foam line system components in accordance with routine or preventative maintenance (PM) schedules.\n\n    \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving TDI at this facility or off-site that have resulted in death(s), injuries, property damage, evacuations, environmental damage or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nNHK has implemented an EAP in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations.

In addition to the spill or release of hazardous chemicals/materials the written EAP contains specific information to address other emergency response related incidents such as fire, bomb threats, earthquake or tornados/severe weather.  NHK conducts regular training on emergency response procedures as well as incident notification and incident preparedness.  In addition, NHK has coordinated with local emergency responders (e.g., Frankfort Fire Department) in the event of a release of TDI.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNHK plans to add additional security measures (e.g., video surveillance) at the bulk unloading area along with additional signage and labeling.  As part of NHK's continuous improvement philosophy, the facility will strive to identify and update system components and techniques to either improve and/or ensure continued safety.\n\n    \n\n"
