ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at the Seneca Foods Facility in Glencoe, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, emergency shut downs, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of an incidental release.  We also notify and coordinate response efforts with the Glencoe Fire Department providing emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Seneca Foods'  Glencoe facility is a seasonal vegetable plant.  We process canned and frozen peas and corn.  Ammonia is refrigerant used to process and store these vegatables.  We have approvimately 96,000 pounds of ammonia on site to handle processing and cold storage.\n\n\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWe utilized [ALOHA(R)] for the worst case release and alternative scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  \n\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary step to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention progrom this is in place at our facility.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- The Seneca Foods' Glencoe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operatiing parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This can be found in this facilities Process Safety Management.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANLAYSIS-  Our facility co"

This facility utilizes the \"What-If\" program to identify and control hazards.  Any findings from the \"What-if\" analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  This process is reviewed every 5 years or when any changes to the system has taken place.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES-  This facility  maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our processes are conducted correctly and safely.   The procedures address various modes of operation that include cold startups, hot startups, normal shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, and normal operating parameters.\n\nTRAINING-  The training for all engine room operators include courses sponsored by refrigeration manufacturers, IIAR and other accredited agencies.  Areas covered include preventive maintenance, trouble shooting, theory, safety, design, standards, operating levels, to name a few. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY-  Mechanical integrity begins in the planning and design process of any portion the system.  This is to make sure that sizing of piping, vessels, electronic components and controls, safeguards (relief valves, cutouts, structural barriers...), building construction and design, ventilation are correct for any type or specific application in the system.  This includes documentation of the previously mentioned areas including certifications where applicable.  The maintenance and preventative maintenance programs used to ensure that all potential  concerns of safety and operation are addressed and corrected in a very timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE-   Written procedures are in place at this facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Engine room operators/ Maintenance personnel, or other personnel that are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modifications and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPR"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are correct for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPIANCE AUDITS-  Compliance audits are conducted annually by JS & Associates.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION- The Glencoe Seneca Foods' facility believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  All facility employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  This is accomplished through this facilities team concept.  This includes monthly department safety meetings, location monthly safety meetings, monthly department safety committee meetings, monthly location safety committee meetings, and this locations Process Safety Management Committee for Ammonia refridgeration.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the RMP particularly information resulting from our process hazard analysis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY- The Glencoe Facility of Seneca Foods has one ammonia related injury to report. The incident occurred on 10/08/2003 at 2:10 p.m. It involvedthe replacement of vessel site glasses. A small amount of ammonia vapor (less than a half pound) escaped resulting in skin burns and respiratory inhalation. The employee was hospitalized and returned to work after being cleared by the attending physician.  There were no other injuries or release incidents to report during the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN-  This facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with releases of hazardous materials.
