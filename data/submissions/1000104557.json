A typical rate of release would be 7.5 lbs/minute and typical weather condition would be Atmospheric Stability Category D with a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour.  The toxic end point of 500 feet was derived from the EPAS RMP Comp Software as a typical urban site and the smallest rate of release with minimal off-site impact. Only the immediate neighboring facilities will be affected and may require limited evacuation.  Passive mitigation to a release of 100 lbs/minute is considered to be the building housing the refrigeration equipment.  Such a release could be contained until automatic and manual shutoff systems could be activated.  Responders could further mitigate the release by absorption in water from a fire hose, and neutralizing the resulting mixture with an acidic media or chemical.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nAspire Bakeries has reviewed its emergency response program in August 2021 to include response procedures addressing the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The update of the plan was done to include minor modifications to the building and addition of a new product lines.  As required, various scenarios have been analyzed.  Company personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and minor repair/maintenance problems.  However, in the event of a release having offsite impact, the facility will work with a HAZMAT team of the Northlake Fire Department to control the emergency and protect the surrounding community.  Notification will be done through the local police and fire department in case evacuation becomes necessary.  The facility has identified public receptors in the area of potential impact and this information is included in the Emergency Action Plan.  A copy of the emergency action plan will be available with the Northlake Fire Department."

March 6th, 2023 the new safety controls and motor were wired in; new 1/4 tubing was installed for safety.\n\nPSM Program has been updated to reflect these changes.\n\nThere have been no other accidents in the past 5 years\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:\n\nThe Aspire Bakeries facility is located in a commercial and industrial zoned section of the City of Northlake. The expressways I-294 and I-290 are located on the west side of the facility at close proximity. The setting is urban.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is considered to be a rupture of the high pressure receiver, which contains most of the ammonia in the system at any given time.  It is contemplated that a rupture such as this would cause loss of all the ammonia in the receiver (10,000 lbs.) over a period of 10 minutes, being released at a constant rate.  The toxic endpoint is taken to be an ERPG-2 of 0.14 mg/1 and was estimated to be 1.2 miles from the source.  The consequences are modeled in atmospheric stability category F, at a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The modeling has been developed by using EPAS RMP Comp Software. However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a tank rupture such as this, there will be offsite impact of the toxic chemical release.  The released ammonia fumes will travel in the direction of the wind.  The distance of travel will depend on the prevailing weather conditions.  Ammonia concentration in the air will be significant so as to warrant the evacuation of surrounding population.  In this case, the company will implement the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nIn a less severe but most likely situation - referred to as a alternative scenario, a release can occur due to gasket rupture, pump seal leak, relief valve leak or"

      "SummaryText": "due to an ammonia release that occurred on October 25, 2022.  During routine maintenance work that was being performed by mechanics on the ammonia refrigeration system a leak was detected at the HTPR vessel package.  Aspire Bakeries immediately contacted Dual Temp, their refrigeration contractor and requested for service assistance to help stop the leak. Further Aspire Bakeries immediately called 911 and the HAZMAT team of Northlake Fire Department responded to the call.  Dual Temp worked with the HAZNAT team to shut-off the leaky valve. After it was determined safe Dual Temp service technicians isolated the pump that leaked.  The quantity of Ammonia released was estimated to be 3500 lbs over duration of 115 minutes.  The area where leak occurred was isolated.  Due to prevailing weather conditions, light rain light wind, vapor cloud from the release was contained within the facility boundary and no evacuation of surrounding community was deemed necessary. No injuries resulted from this incident.   Following the release and according to Emergency Action Plan appropriate notifications were issued to National Response Center and Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).       \n\nIncident investigation revealed that Pump #1 on the HTRP package had a catastrophic interior failure. The ammonia escaped through a 3/8 hole.  The defective pump was removed and sent to the manufacturer to determine where the failure occurred. This pump was replaced by a new pump.  Previous PSM and inspection checks on the system did not indicate any problems with referenced pump.\n\nCorrective action recommended was to perform vibration analysis on all pumps in the ammonia system. This was completed on November 17, 2022. \n\nThe failed Buffalo Pump was replaced with a sealed Cornell Pump with a Pressure Differential Switch (Safety) and a Hansen Pump Guardian which is another Safety Controller. The new pump also has built in Bearing Vibration monitoring.   \n\nOn March 3rd 2023 the new pump was pi"

Aspire Bakeries has implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program that is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur. The Company backs up its commitment to safety by developing and implementing procedures for critical operations and communicating hazards of the process and chemicals used through Hazard Communication Programs.  The Company has ongoing safety programs implemented with the help and participation of specialized consultants.  All safety programs are implemented under the direct supervision of senior management personnel.  Pursuant to the Risk Management Plan regulation and Process Safety Management standard, Aspire Bakeries has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect the employees and surrounding community from accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The facility used a What-If technique for process hazard analysis (PHA).  Further, the implementation of the PSM program includes education in the hazards of ammonia, a preventive maintenance program for the ammonia system, program for pre-startup safety reviews and management of change.  The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as hot working procedures) and contractor safety training.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The Plant Management implements the Plant Safety Program. The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance; eliminate human suffering, losses and property damage resulting from injuries and accidents. \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nAspire Bakeries is updating the five year accident history"
