This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nHunt Southland's Sandersville Refinery located in Sandersville, Mississippi operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, primarily asphalt related, from raw crude oil. Within the refining industry we are known as a topping operation in that our focus is on the 50% to 55% of the barrel of crude which is asphalt. The remaining light ends are sold as either non-highway diesel or as feedstock for other refineries, or used in specialty asphalt products, i.e. cutback asphalts. \n\nThe Sandersville refinery is considered small by industry standards with a maximum capacity of 12,500 barrels per day. For the past several years we have averaged less that 8,000 bpd.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION STEPS \n\nWe have developed process safety guidelines for processes that represent the greatest risk to Hunt Southland employees the public and per OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, and the environment. In addition to these process safety guidelines, Hunt Southland has numerous other programs that incorporate accident prevention and loss control. \n\nEmployee participation takes place on both an informal and formal basis. Informally, safety suggestions and concerns are relayed to management through supervisors or directly. The safety manager also collects suggestions during safety walk-throughs. Incident investigations are conducted with hourly employees participating in the i"

In addition to typical hazard communication information, documents are also kept on key process parameters, chemical mixture, technical manuals for key equipment, and industry guidelines for safe operations in petroleum refineries. \n\nAs the storage tank for light naphtha has few \"processes\" a \"what if\" analysis was developed to address process hazards. The light naphtha storage tank has an internal floating roof that is the key component that could fail and significantly increase the risk of a VCE. The storage tank is also gauged daily. During this gauging the tank is inspected for problems or weakened components.\n\n\n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has historically experienced a low employee turnover rate. As a consequence, refinery personnel are quite knowledgeable and effective. Additionally, all employees are trained under OSHA's 24 Hour Hazardous Waste Operator Standard and at the state fire academy for fire brigaded training. Refreshers are conducted annually for Hazwoper and semi-annually for fire training (two days). \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has historically used the same contractors for construction and maintenance within the facility. Contractors are expected to know and follow Hunt Southland's safety standards and to work under the oversight of a Hunt Southland supervisor at all times while within the refinery facility.\n\nWhile a pre-startup safety review is followed for significant changes within the refinery and would be part of any maintenance operation or equipment modification, a PSSR has not been part of the light naphtha storage activities. \n\nMechanical integrity of the storage tank is focused on the proper operation and maintenance of the internal floating roof and the gauging for thickness of the steel shell. During all maintenance operations, standard safe work practices are"

Accident and incident investigation are conducted whenever there has been an accident, near miss, or other incident. A compliance audit is conducted on the storage tank during its semi-annual inspections for floating roof tanks. A tracking system is in place to monitor any recommendations.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe key element of release containment, control, and mitigation is the permanent foam chamber installed in the roof of the storage tank. External monitors and other fire suppression equipment are stored near the vicinity of the tank. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn reviewing the OSHA 200 logs for the last five years there were no accidents or incidents related to the naphtha storage process.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company maintains written emergency response programs for a variety of regulatory programs. The programs include: TIER II reports for EPCRA, emergency action plans, emergency response plans, SPCC plans, pipeline spill response plans, and process safety management plan.\n\n"
