More specific ways that employees can be involved in the Risk Management Program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\nIn addition, employees and management have a number of initiatives in place that are designed to improve safety at the plant.  These initiatives are focused on both the plant processes and general worker safety (including slips, trips, and falls), and even off-the-job safety.  These initiatives include safety teams that have been chartered to improve safety, both on and off the job.  These safety teams typically have members from various functional areas of the plant -- including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management -- to ensure the team has a broad perspective, which leads to better ideas to improve safety.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the plant's operations and processes are identified and minimized.  This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the Wingate Fractionator is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a release of a regulated substance.
