If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Chokio Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery to the farm for application.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe minimum quantity would be 140,000 pounds in one 27,000 gallon tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 120,000 pounds representing 85 percent of the capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 4.1 miles.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on the two minute release is a release from a break in a 3 inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.14 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1? published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years at this site.\n\nChokio Equity Exchange  has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29-CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA III (EPRCA).\n\nChokio Equity Exchange will coordinate this plan with the local emergency "
