If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.\tFacility Information:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  \nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.\tThe Five-year Accident History:\n\na.\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\u00c2\u00bf\tTo our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.\tThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has:\n\na"
