Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nAt Nalco Company, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning to help ensure the protection of the environment, the safety of our employees, and the safety of the general public.  As founding members of the local Community Advisory Group, we firmly believe in that we must consider community concerns when conducting our business.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented to protect the public, including:\r\n\r\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP Rule\r\n- An overview of our emergency response program\r\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nNalco Company is the largest provider of water treatment and process chemicals, services and systems in the world.  Our facility produces these chemicals using a variety of raw materials and process operations.
