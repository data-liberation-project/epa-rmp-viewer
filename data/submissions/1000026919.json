This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tAFM policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tAffiliated Foods Midwest (AFM) Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at AFM; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.

It is AFM's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Affiliated Foods Midwest cooperative is a wholesale food distribution and warehousing cooperative that specializes in fresh produce, meats, deli products, baked goods, dairy items, and frozen foods, as well as general merchandise and equipment.   \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 424410.  A large portion of the warehouse/distribution center is refrigerated to preserve products for distribution.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating coolers and freezers in the warehouse/distribution center. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia being charged to the refrigeration system is approximately 21,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool  freezers, coolers, docks, produce, and banana rooms.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The ammonia related equipment could be divided into three sections. The low pressure equipment contains (2) Ice Cream Freezer Evaporators, (2) Holding Freezer Evaporators, (1) Low Temperature Pump Package (LTPR), (1) Oil Pot and (1) Booster Compressor.  The intermediate pressure equipment contains (2) 28 degree Meat Cooler Evaporators, (2) 55 degree Dry Produce Evaporators, (1) 35 degree Wet Produce Evaporator, (2) 35 degree Dry Produce Evaporator, (1) 45 degree Dry Produce Evaporators, (1) 35 degree Staging Evaporator, (8) Banana Room Evaporators, (1) High Temperature Pump Package (HTPR), (1) Oil Pot, (1) Swing Compressor, and (2) High Stage Compressors.
