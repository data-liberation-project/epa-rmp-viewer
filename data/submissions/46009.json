      "SummaryText": "REGULATED SUBSTANCE AND STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to provide cold storage at Colorado Custom Distribution Services of Atlanta Georgia. Anhydrous ammonia is listed in 40CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance.   Accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere may reach public receptors surrounding the facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia is lighter than air, a colorless gas, and impacts public health when inhaled above the toxic end point as defined within 40 CFR 68.22. \n\nThere are two refrigeration systems located at Colorado Custom Distribution Services of Atlanta Georgia, each refrigeration system consists of 2-stage compression (3 compressors), a condenser, receiver, two accumulators (15?F and -25?F) and four ammonia pumps. Liquid refrigerant is pumped from the two accumulators to various evaporators for cooling and freezing food storage areas. Ammonia refrigerant is vaporized in the evaporators and returns to each stage of compression where it combines with accumulator flash vapor and compressed to condenser pressure.  After condensing and flowing into the receiver, the liquid is cooled by pressure expansion into the two lower pressure accumulators."
