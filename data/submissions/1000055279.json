      "SummaryText": "Columbus Chemical Industries, Inc. (CCI) formulates, blends, packages, and distributes a wide variety of chemicals for many different industrial, commercial, and educational applications.  CCI has been in business for over 30 years, and is pleased to have many long-term employees.  CCI is certified to the quality standards of ISO 9001.  CCI is also certified to the rigorous comprehensive Responsible Distribution protocol of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  CCI was most recently re-certified in 2015 to both ISO and NACD.\n\n\n\nAccidental release of chemicals is mitigated by ongoing employee training, strict inventory practices, established standard operating procedures, detailed maintenance practices, and systems to control and contain processes. Emergency response activities are addressed in multiple documents, both developed by the facility and developed jointly with cooperating agencies.  These activities are reinforced by ongoing training, by the related day-to-day experience entailed in basic CCI operations, and by the many inspections and audits to which CCI is subjected by agencies, insurance companies, and customers.                                                                                                                                                                           \n\n\n\nCCI maintains a Hazmat Team of 12 employees, including participation from all operating departments and all employee levels.  Every Hazmat Team member has received a minimum of 24 hours of specialized training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q); most members maintain 40 hours of training.  Training is provided by outside experts, online courses, and in-house classroom sessions, supplemented with hands-on experience.  The Hazmat Team can deal with all but certain significant incidents, after which outside assistance would be sought from pre-established sources. The 5-year incident history contains no incidents for which outside assistance was needed. "

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nThe entire CCI facility is served with a ESFR sprinkler system.  The flammables area has a AR-AFFF foam system.  The fire suppression system includes an on-site 190,000 gallon fire water reservoir and a large emergency generator for the facility's fire pump.  Warehouses are completely contained, designed to hold both the stored chemicals and fire suppression system water.  Flammables storage areas are served with floor trenches leading to double wall underground concrete holding tanks.  Production areas are served with floor trenches leading to collection sumps and the wastewater neutralization system.  Storm drains are completely separate, and are covered in a WDNR \"No Exposure\" certification.  \n\n\n\nThe process that is the subject of this RMP is a 5000 gallon flow-through process vessel located in a concrete containment inside the production building.  The vessel is normally empty.  Approximately every two weeks the facility receives a tank truck of 37% hydrochloric acid.  CCI packages the 37% hydrochloric acid into intermediate bulk containers (IBCs), 55-gallon drums (drums), and other containers of various sizes. The flow of the 37% hydrochloric acid from the tank truck to the packaging stations in the facility's dedicated acid room is through the dedicated 37% hydrochloric acid flow-through process vessel.  The usual sequence of packaging the 37% hydrochloric acid is to connect the tank truck to the interior dedicated piping leading to the flow-through process vessel, and then to begin unloading the 37% hydrochloric acid until a sufficient quantity has entered the flow-through process vessel (approximately 500 gallons) to assure no cavitation in the packaging pumps.  While unloading of the tank truck continues, the 37% hydrochloric acid is pumped from the flow-through process vessel to the packaging stations in the dedicated acid room.  Packaging proceeds while the remaining contents of the tank truck flow through the flow-through process vessel.  Depending o"

      "SummaryText": "n the details of the packaging orders, the tank truck is usually emptied in from 2-6 hours.  The flow-through process vessel is usually empty at the end of the initial and any subsequent packaging runs, in part because each tank truck load of 37% hydrochloric acid constitutes a separate lot, and mixing of different lots usually needs to be avoided.\n\n\n\nIn the future, this process may occasionally be subject to minor revision, such as to accommodate upgrades to the facility's cGMP capabilities or during extremely cold winter weather if packaging the load will be into all smaller containers.  The tank truck may need to be unloaded in a time frame that might result in the flow-through process vessel temporarily containing more than the RMP quantity pounds of 37% hydrochloric acid.  Such a situation would be infrequent and would be expected to be of short duration, from a few hours to perhaps a day.  The 37% hydrochloric acid flow-through process vessel would be empty, or contain a small quantity of the 37% hydrochloric acid, the rest of the time.  Nevertheless, even though the new potential situation is not regarded as constituting storage in the conventional sense, the new potential situation could place the process subject to RMP as we understand the RMP rules.  Thus, CCI has prepared this Predictive Filing.  \n\n  \n\nThe flow-through process vessel has a capacity of 5000 gallons.  The inside concrete containment in which the flow-through process vessel is located has a holding capacity of approximately 43,040 gallons.  The wastewater neutralization tank and the associated overflow tank have a combined capacity of 8200 gallons.                                                                                                \n\n\n\nCCI interacts frequently with local and state emergency response groups.  In July 2014 CCI hosted a regional emergency response exercise with 14 participating agencies and 2 TV stations.  The scenario included a tornado causing injuries, structural d"
