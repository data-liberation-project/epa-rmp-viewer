Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LINDE GAS, LLC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Acetylene  [Ethyne], Chlorine, Propane and Propylene  [1-Propene].\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLINDE GAS, LLC. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and/or HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every two years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 08/15/2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFo"
