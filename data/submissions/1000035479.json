A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control check sheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Site Leader has overall responsibility for this program.\r\n\r\nDesignated personnel are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\r\n\r\nDesignated personnel maintain the Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool for reference.\r\n\r\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track the items to completion.\r\n\r\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures or processes do not cause accidents.

To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\r\n\r\nIn the Momentive Specialty Chemicals Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\n2.Stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThis plant primarily makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes 1 (1) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities, one (1)Urea-Formaldehyde/Phenol -Formaldehyde Resin Reactor, one (1) Urea-Formaldehyde/ Formaldehyde Resin Reactor.  Although we sell some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for various types of resins.  Aqua ammonia is used as a raw material for urea-formaldehyde resins.  The facility recently moved from tote storage of the Ammonia Solution to a storage tank.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde                    1,300,000 lbs.\r\nAmmonia                               97,000 lbs."

      "SummaryText": "MOC initiates a safety review.  This review may include a process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by technical and plant personnel.\r\n\r\nA preventative maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  An electronic database is used to manage the preventative maintenance schedule and other corrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain the ongoing integrity and reliability of the facility equipment.  Each month scheduled equipment inspections, test, or servicing are performed.  The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\r\n\r\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding other hot work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\r\n\r\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\r\n\r\nIncidents that cause or could have cuased a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendation may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions or training.\r\n\r\nInternal corporate health, safety and environmental audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  Regional safety and environmental professionals periodically review the health, safety and environmental programs.  Addressing recommendations from these audits and reviews keeps the Facility Safety and Environmental programs effective.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year acciden"
