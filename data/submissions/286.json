THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR RESALE TO FARMERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECIEVED STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION TO CROPLAND.                                                                                                    THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 360,000 POUNDS IN OUR (2)-30,000 GALLONS TANKS AND (1)-26,000 GALLON TANK.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A RAIL CAR TANK HOLDING 150,000 POUNDS.                                                                                       THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A 30,000 GALLON TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE 30,000 GALLON TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 2.0 MILES.  WRITTEN OPERATING PROCEDURES PREVENT TANKS FROM BEING FILLED BEYOND 85% AS SPECIFIED IN DESIGN STANDARDS   USING A TANK LEVEL GAGE.          THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT OF SUCH A RELEASE IS .7 MILES. EXCESS FLOW VALVES PREVENT RELEASE ABOVE NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURES.
