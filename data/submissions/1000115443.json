The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.  To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required for personal safety.  Our objective is the safety program reducing our exposure to accidents to the absolute minimum.\n\nSafety Audits are done at our facilities to insure compliance with all regulations and safety practices.\n\nOUR GOAL IS ZERO ACCIDENTS AND ZERO INJURIES.\nThrough a cooperative effort by each employee, we will attain our goal.\n\nWe recognize the responsibilities for safety are shared:\n\n1.  The employer accepts responsibility for leadership of the safety program, for its effectiveness, and safeguards providing a safe work place.\n\n2.  Employees are responsible for wholehearted cooperation of the safety program, including compliance with all rules, and practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\nEmployees are very actively involved in the safety program.

The stationary source and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Western International Lincoln facility is a loading, unloading, and storage facility for Propylene.  The facility operates as an offloading facility for Propylene from railcars to tanks and from tanks to transport trailers.  The railcar to tank transfer is performed in two steps: liquid is transferred by differential pressure created by compressing vapor from a storage tank into the railcar.  After the liquid transfer is"

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nWestern complies with the EPA RMP regulation, OSHA PSM regulations and NFPA 58 guidelines and Railroad Commission regulations. \n\nWestern takes pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  \n\nD. The five year accident history:\n\nThe five year accident history covers only certain releases (\u00a768.42(a)):\n\n1) The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2) The release must have caused at least one of the following:\na) On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\nb) Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nA review of the facility\u0092s accident history showed that there have been no releases in the last five years that met the criteria above.\n\nE.  The emergency response program:\n\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Lincoln Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \n\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur.  Alert systems within the facility consist of word of mouth and by handheld cellular phones. \n\nF.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nIt is the intention of management and this company to continue to train and strive for excellence in the industrial gas business.  We believe that pr"
