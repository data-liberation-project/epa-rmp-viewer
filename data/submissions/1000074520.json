The Corporate Environmental Compliance Team administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Corporate Environmental Compliance Team periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nC&S - Westfield is located at 53 Summit Lock Road in Westfield, Massachusetts which is approximately 2 miles north of the I-90.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in the early 1990s with a major expansion of the facility completed in early 2004.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural. The facility uses approximately 62,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nOff-site Release Scenarios\n\nC&S has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines,\" and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes. Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies w"

Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system uses approximately 62,000 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, ice making, dock operations, cold storage, and freezer warehousing. The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condensers (6) to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver.  A bevy located at the top of the vessel maintains a reservoir of liquid ammonia for thermosyphon oil cooling of the Compressors and any excess liquid overflows to the main storage portion of the vessel.  The Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver feeds high-pressure liquid ammonia to the Intercooler, as needed.  High pressure vapor from the vessel is used to pressurize the transfer drum associated with the Intercooler and in the defrost cycle of the Evaporators.\n\n\n\nAt the Intercooler, the high-pressure ammonia liquid is chilled as it passes through coils immersed in a bath of liquid ammonia located inside the vessel.  The resultant controlled pressure liquid th"

Wet suction from the Frick Ice Makers and the +20&#61616;F/+30&#61616;F Ice Storage Evaporators returns to a Suction Accumulator and wet suction from the Truck Dock and Ice Making Rooms returns to the Low Temperature Recirculator. The level of the bath of ammonia within the Intercooler is maintained by a liquid float switch connected to the liquid inlet from the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver.  The Intercooler also feeds medium temperature liquid to the Low Temperature Recirculator, as needed.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of a high level situation within the Intercooler, liquid can be transferred back to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver via a Transfer Drum. The transfer cycle is initiated when a three-way valve, which vents vapor in the Transfer Drum back to the Intercooler during normal operation, closes the vent line and allows hot gas to pressurize the Transfer Drum before pumping the liquid back to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver.  The Suction Accumulator operates a similar transfer system, with hot gas provided by the High Stage Compressors and liquid transferred to the Intercooler. \n\n\n\nThe Low Temperature Recirculator pumps liquid ammonia to Evaporators located within the Bakery, -10&#61616;F, -15&#61616;F and -20&#61616;F Freezer Warehouses.  The ammonia, flowing through coils located within the Evaporator units, partially boils as it removes heat from the product and room. The resultant liquid/ vapor mix from each evaporator is routed back to the vessel that fed it.  The liquid droplets fall to the bottom of the vessel, while the vapor is drawn from the top by the Compressors.\n\n\n\nThe Booster Compressors draw low stage suction from the Low Temperature Recirculator and discharge to the Intercooler.

All Compressors receive high-pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver for oil cooling purposes.  At the Condensers, air and water is used to condense the high-pressure gas into high-pressure liquid, which then drains to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.\n\n\n\nHigh Stage Compressor discharge is also used in the Glycol Underfloor Heat Exchanger.  Glycol, used in a separate closed system to heat the floor under the freezer, is heated by high-pressure ammonia vapor as it passes through the Heat Exchanger.  The liquid ammonia condenses and then drains to the Low Temperature Recirculator.  The system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensables, i.e. air, from the system.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-St"

The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Ammonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and within each refrigerated space throughout the warehouse. An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the C&S Refrigeration Technicians and maintenance management.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the Facility in the last five years (December 2013 - December 2018) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. There was a fire in the Engine Room in May 2018 that was caused by a compressor motor. This fire did not cause an ammonia release. \n\n\n\nThe previous RMP*eSubmit included an ammonia release that took place on May 24, 2009.
