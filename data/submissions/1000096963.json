Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n\n\nManagement and employees of NW Agronomy Company LLC, Welcome, MN location (hereinafter LLC), are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\nThe LLC periodically retains OUTSIDE contractors who utilize a mobile unit for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids.  The LLC is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does the LLC own the conversion equipment.  The liquid fertilizer grade produced during the conversion process is 10-34-00.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. The anhydrous ammonia used in the conversion process is brought onto the facility in a semi transport. The anhydrous ammonia is on site temporarily:  the anhydrous ammonia is never off-loaded into a permanent storage container at the LLC.  Therefore this RMP is being filed as a Predictive Filing.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe LLC has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture Administrative Rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. LLC employees are not involved with the conversion process-the contractor utilizes their own employees. The contractors have provided the LLC with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the conversion process.  \n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:  \n\nNone-There have"

Accident histories referenced in Section 8 solely relate to the respective contractors only and did not happen at the NW Agronomy LLC physical site. \n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe LLC has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standards. The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The EAP plan was last updated in July 2016 and reviewed by site employees in July 2016 as well.  A site  Incident Response Plan (per Minnesota Department of Agricultural requirements) is also in place. In the event of an accidental release during the conversion process, the LLC employees understand they must call 911; and follow all established evacuation and emergency procedures set forth in their EAP and IRP.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe LLC has an AWAIR program in place and is committed to a safe working environment.\n\n\n\nThe Conversion Contractors have:\n\nProvided the LLC with documentation confirming they meet the requirements of the fourteen (14) elements under 29 CFR Part 1910 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 CFR Part 68, Section 112, as well as EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Their portable or mobile mix units carry a PSM/RMP manual and it would be on site at all times during the conversion process.  Both contractors have a company Emergency Action Plan and a Field Emergency Procedure/Plan.  \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Currently, there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation.  \n\n"
