All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to. NewStar\u00bfs emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. It is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe NewStar facility in Yuma is utilized for fresh vegetable processing and wholesaling. The facility uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to cool the processing areas. The facility uses 39,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for this process, identified as \u00bfworst case release scenario\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release scenario.\u00bf The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\u00bf due to an unspecified failure. The alternative release scenario is based on that which is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the EPA toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00bf  The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected."

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted once every year; emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
