We at Sunny Fresh Foods operate our facility with the safety of employees, neighbors and nearby communities as our first concern.  We meet or exceed all federal, state and local standards in the operation of our plant.   For additional information call:   612-271-5600\n\n\n\nSunny Fresh Foods core purpose is to be the supplier of choice for our customers worldwide.  Sunny Fresh Foods stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  We carry a full line of liquid egg products, diced egg and breakfast entree products.\n\n\n\nWe utilize ammonia in our refrigeration system to control temperatures of our manufacturing process.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures inhibiting microbiological growth.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used  refrigerants in the food industry and is the most effective and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food at its proper temperature.  It is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  The refrigeration system at Sunny Fresh Foods controls the temperature of product in holding tanks, pasteurizing, cooler and blast freezer warehouse, production rooms and entree freezers in Further Processing.\n\n\n\nSunny Fresh Foods has calculated a worst case scenario involving a failure of our high pressure receiver causing 2200 pounds of ammonia to be released over 10 minutes.  This would have a predicted impact of six tenths of a mile and potentially affect 140 people and small businesses around the Sunny Fresh Monticello, MN plant.  An alternative scenario would be a failure of a valve resulting in a release of 1300 pounds over 10 minutes.  Thi"
