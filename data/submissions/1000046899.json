The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system(s) in this facility use anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThis facility follows a rigorous RMP & Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM & RMP programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan will be provided to the local LEPC for review.\n\n\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\n\nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperature, two-stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity for +20F high temperature suction and for -20F low temperature suction. This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system. Engine room electrical classification is NEMA-1.\n\n\n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains seven interconnected sub-systems:\n\n1.Low temperature system.\n\n2.High temperature system.\n\n3.Thermosyphon pilot receiver system.\n\n4.High-pressure receiver system.\n\n5.Condenser system.\n\n6.Compressor l"

It operates at a saturated liquid temperature of +20A?F. The low-stage booster-compressors discharge superheated vapor into this vessel. The superheated vapor bubbles up through liquid ammonia giving up its superheat and creating more vapor volume. The high-temperature liquid is pumped from this vessel using ammonia pumps. The high-temperature air units are fed with this liquid. The liquid-vapor mixture, from the high-temperature air units, is returned to this vessel where the liquid is separated from the vapor. The high-stage compressors pull ammonia vapor from this vessel and compress it to approximately 181 PSIG. This vessel has connection with low-stage booster-compressors, high-stage compressors, high-temperature air units, and with the high-pressure liquid piping.\n\n\n\nThe low-temperature re-circulator is a vertical pressure vessel. It operates a saturated liquid temperature of -20A?F. The low-temperature liquid is pumped from this vessel to the freezer air units where thirty- percent of the liquid mass is evaporated. The liquid-vapor mixture is returned to this vessel where the liquid is separated from the vapor.

It receives liquid from the condenser. The thermosyphon oil coolers on the screw compressors are fed from this vessel and return a liquid/gas mix back through the thermosyphon return piping. Most of the liquid ammonia from the condenser drains through this receiver to the high-pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe high-pressure receiver is a vertical pressure vessel. The high -pressure receiver stores the ammonia liquid coming from the condenser. All liquid from the condenser flows through this vessel. High-pressure liquid is fed from this vessel to the rest of the system.\n\n\n\nThe evaporative condensers use axial fans in a draw-through configuration. High-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high-temperature compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed, condensing the vapor to a high-pressure liquid. High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained into the thermosyphon pilot-receiver. Saturated condensing temperature is 95A?F (181.1 PSIG) at a corresponding 67A?F WB. The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge line and the condenser drain lines go to the thermosyphon pilot-receiver.\n\n\n\nThe compressor discharge hot gas is used to defrost the evaporators. During defrost, the hot gas refrigerant gives up heat and condenses. With the fans shut down, the ability of the coil to transfer that heat to the air is severely limited. Thus, the heat from the hot gas is absorbed by metal in the coil. As the metal absorbs heat, its temperature rises. Once the surface temperature is high enough, any ice and/or frost on the coil surface will melt and drain off. Defrosting the evaporators occurs automatically on a time sequence by individual sequence timers.\n\n\n\nIn this facility, the evaporators are fed from liquid pumps. The feed rate is approximately 3:1. This system will circulate three tim"

P&ID prints are available for review. Pipe, fittings, and connections specifications for ammonia refrigeration systems shall meet or exceed ASME/ANSI B31.5 specifications.\n\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels are inside the building. The emergency ventilation discharges the engine room air through the roof, which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\n\n\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for all employees, not directly involved with the "

Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits. Community involvement is through coordination, cooperation, and pre-planning with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vess"

The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\n\n\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutt"

The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all areas of PSM and RMP programs are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years. Resubmission of the RMP shall be done every five years to meet the OCA requirements.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\n"
