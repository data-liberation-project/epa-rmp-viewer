      "SummaryText": "Griffin Warehouse, Inc has served the farming community in Douglas, Georgia for the past 30 years. We have a comprehensive emergency response plan and an accident prevention program in place at all of our facilities.  We cooperate with public emergency planning agencies on a regular basis to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release.  All of our employees attend annual procedural safety and emergency response classes.  This policy has allowed us to remain accident free for more than five years.\n\nOur aqueous ammonia tank is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe reliable operation.  The last comprehensive facility inspection was on February 29, 2000.  A chain link fence to keep out unauthorized personnel encloses the facility.  Safety labels are placed on the tanks, and at fill stations.   There is a NFPA placard posted on the chemical warehouse that is visible from the facility entrance. The facility's 25,000 gallon tank and piping are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressurization and underpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with manual shutoff valves that can be used to shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  There is a safety shower located at the facility. \n\nThe worst case scenario indicates that businesses an residential areas offsite would possibly be affected in the event of a catastrophic release.  However we believe that our vigorous safety and emergency response programs greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario from ever happening.  The worst case model that produced this scenario was unable to take into account all of our mitigation and containment measures which would greatly reduce the toxic endpoint radius.  Our tank is enclosed behind a three and one half foot high containment dike that would reduce the evaporation of the spilled product.  The alternative case release scenario is a more accurate assessment of risk to the community.  In the alternate rel"
