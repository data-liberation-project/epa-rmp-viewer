      "SummaryText": "The Hutchinson Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed this Risk Management Plan because of the amount of chlorine that is kept on-site.  Chlorine is used in one-ton cylinders and up to four cylinders may be present on site at any time.  A Risk Management Plan is required by EPA rules (40 CFR 68) when a facility stores greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine at any one time.\n\nAn analysis of a worst case release scenario, as defined by the EPA rules and a more likely alternate release scenario, selected from trade association guidance, was conducted and is documented in this plan.  The alternate case release scenario indicates that a radius of three tenths of a mile would be included in the distance to toxic endpoint.  In reality, an actual release would likely affect a much smaller radius, due to passive mitigation, such as the building enclosure, which was not included in the scenario.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility operates and maintains the chlorination system under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which was developed to comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program is designed to operate and maintain the system and the equipment in a manner that will reduce the possibility of a chlorine release.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, the facility has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Hutchinson Fire Department."
