      "SummaryText": "Duke Energy Progress, LLC.'s Roxboro Steam Electric Plant is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Semora, North Carolina. The plant uses Anhydrous ammonia in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The SCR systems are designed to inject ammonia gas into the boiler flue gas and then pass the ammonia/flue gas mixture through a catalyst. The catalyst causes a reaction that reduces NOx (pollutant) in the flue gas, converting NOx into nitrogen gas and water. The Roxboro Plant stores the ammonia in three (3) 65,450-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. The anhydrous ammonia in the storage tanks is liquefied under pressure. These tanks are limited to a maximum fill volume of 55,600 gallons(85%). The Risk Management Plan addresses the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia used in the SCR system.\n\n\n\nRoxboro Plant has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA (Process Safety Management, PSM, 29CFR1910.119) and EPA (Risk Management Program, 40CFR68). In addition, for responding to emergencies the plant has an Integrated Emergency Response Plan that complies with all regulatory programs, including OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q)). The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nThe SCR systems were placed in service between 2001 and 2005. There is no accident history. To further ensure a safe process, Process Hazard Analysis was conducted for commissioning of each of the SCR systems. Opportunities to improve process safety stemming from the first PHA, and continuing from each PHA since, were identified and implemented, including equipping the system with interlocks and excess flow valves and establishing emergency shutdown procedures. As well, the ammonia storage tanks were located in a dike designed to contain 110% of the"

      "SummaryText": " entire inventory of a single tank. \n\n\n\nTo further comply with regulatory mandates, a worst-case release scenario and an alternate scenario have been developed and modeled for this 5-year update of the RMP. The PHAST (Process Hazard Analysis Software Tools) model (a model accepted by the EPA) was used for the dispersion modeling.  The worst case scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The scenario used for this analysis was a tank rupture in which the total quantity in the tank is completely released over a 10-minute period. This is extremely unlikely due to tank design and construction.  Notwithstanding, the model predicts an off-site impact.\n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario was the case where transfer hose rupture in which total quanity in the hose (40 lbs.) is completely released over a 1 minute period. Notwithstanding, the model predicts .1 mile impact.\n\n\n\nThe Roxboro S. E. Plant, striving be become better is PSM safety program and employee participation, has created and implemented a functioning PSM/RMP compliance team. This compliance team meets quarterly to review and certify procedures, participate in audits, review corrective items and work to correct and complete any action items. "
