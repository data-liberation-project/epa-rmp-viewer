      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Kirkman Water Treatment Plant (Kirkman WTP) is owned by the Orlando Utilities Commission.   The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention WTP programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Kirkman  WTP is located on at 4070 South Kirkman Road,  Orlando, Orange County, Florida. Kirkman WTP adds chlorine in their chlorination process in order to disinfect  the City's water supply.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to ten one-ton containers at the Chlorination process building.  All ten one-ton containers are always connected to the process.  Eight one-ton containers are on-line at one time feeding the system with four on standby when those are exhausted.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 24,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is enclosed in a building.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of a one- ton container from the Chlorination process, releasing 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, and considering passive mitigation, and a release rate of 6.4 lb/min the chlorine gas could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance lookup tables.\n\nSeveral Alternative Case Release Scenarios were considered; however, no Alternative-Case Release Scenario resulted in an offsite consequence for the Kirkman Water Treatment Plant.  This is due to the active mitigation measures available, including both the 100 percent control efficiency of the chlorine scrubber and the ability to dispatch OUC and emergency response personnel to the site before the scrubber wo"

      "SummaryText": "uld be exhausted.  However, to report an alternative-case scenario to EPA, a release was assumed to go beyond the ten minutes used in all the EPA Guidances.  It was assumed that it would take OUC personnel 33.8 minutes to respond to the release and the scrubber would be exhausted after 23.8 minutes.  This would result in an estimated mitigated release rate of 2.7 lb/min inside the building for ten minutes and an endpoint distance of 0.1 miles, after the scrubber was exhausted and personnel arrived, using the WWTP Guidance loolup tables. \n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, however this is an unmanned site and is therefore not subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Kirkman  WTP  Chlorination process in the Program 2 level.  The Kirkman facility will address all elements for the Prevention Program 2 as required by the RMP rule.\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, Process Safety Information,  Preventative Maintenance Program, and Operating Procedures. Compliance Audits, Safety Training, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Kirkman facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Pershing Control Center has an Emergency Response Procedure in place.  The Plant Operator at the Pershing Control Center has some accidental assessment capabilities and can respond immediately to all emergencies by dispatching appropriate personnel to the site.  The OUC Water Production mechanics have been trained in chlorine safety and have a procedure fo"
