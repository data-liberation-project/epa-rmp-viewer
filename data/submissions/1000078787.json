      "SummaryText": "SECTION 1\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nIntroduction \r\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  The Minneapolis Public Works Division of Water Treatment and Distribution Services (WTDS) Fridley Complex stores chemicals that it uses in its daily operations. The Fridley Complex includes the Fridley Chemical Building (FCB), which uses chlorine stored in up to 84 one-ton containers and the Fridley Ammonia Building (FAB) which uses anhydrous ammonia stored in three 2,000 gallon bulk storage tanks.  Chlorine and ammonia are used at the Fridley Complex to disinfect treated water prior to distribution to customers in Minneapolis and surrounding communities.  The natural world contains more that 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds.  Chlorine is also used to disinfect wastewater, disinfect our swimming pools and protect human health through the destruction of disease-causing organisms. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children who die daily could be saved through the use of an effective water disinfection agent such as chlorine.\r\nChlorine and ammonia are non-explosive and non-flammable. However, they support combustion under some circumstances.  They are both respiratory irritants, and exposure through inhalation or eye or skin contact can pose a health risk.  As a precaution, the FCB and FAB have special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine and ammonia systems.\r\nWe take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we take providing the community with safe purified drinking water.  The following document describes the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in the event of an emergency.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's"

      "SummaryText": "(EPA's) Risk Management Program, codified under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The Risk Management Program requires facilities that use certain substances above certain quantity thresholds to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. This plan is referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\r\nChlorine and ammonia are stored in quantities at the FAB, and FCB above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP is required.  This RMP document summarizes our existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia to the environment. \r\nThe Fridley Complex has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle accidental releases.  In addition, City staff regularly work with the Minneapolis and Fridley Fire Departments on emergency planning and response coordination, including conducting tours for and drills with these emergency responders of the facility.  \r\nThe Fridley Complex has been handling chemicals since 1925.  To date, no chlorine or ammonia releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred. Minor releases that have occurred at the plant have been safely remedied using existing emergency response procedures and techniques.   \r\nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Fridley Complex\r\nThe Fridley Complex, operating since 1925, is located at 4300 Marshall Street NE in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Raw water supplied from the Mississippi River is treated at the Fridley Softening Plant and the Fridley Filtration Plant (FFP), and treated water is distributed to customers in Minneapolis and the surrounding communities.  The water treatment process includes screening, softening, coagulation, filtration, and d"

The storage tanks at the FAB include automatic shutoff valves that will automatically close in response to a leak alarm, high pressure alarm or fire alarm.  \r\nThe chlorine and ammonia process rooms are enclosed in a building and the process areas are equipped with ventilation systems.  The chlorine process area includes an automatic ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector detects chlorine in the room.  The FCB emergency ventilation system activates a scrubber when chlorine is detected in the room.  The scrubber neutralizes the chlorine gas and discharges treated air to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is sized to treat the entire contents of one 1-ton chlorine container.  The FAB emergency ventilation system activates a scrubber when ammonia is detected in the room above 35 ppm.  The scrubber neutralizes the ammonia and discharges treated air to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is sized to treat 10,000 pounds of ammonia in 90 minutes.    \r\nThe Fridley Complex is surrounded by a fence and is staffed 24 hours per day.   Surveillance cameras are used throughout the facility and are monitored by security personnel and by plant operators at the operator workstation. Access control systems are in place for both the plant grounds and the plant buildings. \r\nRMP Requirements\r\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very s"

In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine or ammonia was determined, and sensitive receptors were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case.\"  The results of the Hazard Assessment are reported to EPA.\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\r\nEmployee Participation \r\nThe participation of the WTDS staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\r\nPlant staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops. Another way that the WTDS staff participated in the development of the RMP/PSM was the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below.  \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of the RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program. All the required process safety information was compiled as stated in the RMP regulations. The information"

This information was used by plant staff to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine and ammonia processes.\r\nThe chlorine and ammonia PHAs were conducted by an interdisciplinary team of plant staff familiar with process operation and maintenance. The PHA was done using a combination of \"What-If\" and \"Checklist\" methods. Based on the results of the PHAs, numerous changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the plant were identified. Several changes have been adopted by the plant, and have been incorporated as part of the overall RMP/PSM program. Other improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are scheduled to be implemented or incorporated.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nOperating procedures for the chlorine and ammonia processes have been developed as part of the RPM/PSM plan. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\r\nTraining\r\nAn effective RMP/PSM training program can significantly reduce the potential for accidental release incidents.

In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, select staff have been trained to respond to an accidental release. Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. Refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.\r\nContractors\r\nThe plant must make contractors aware of the known hazards of the chlorine and ammonia processes related to the contractors' work. In addition, the plant must make contractors aware of the applicable elements of its emergency response plan. Staff must evaluate contractors' safety programs and select only those that can perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine or ammonia processes without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility or the surrounding public. \r\nBefore allowing a contractor to work on or adjacent to the chlorine or ammonia processes, the plant must obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs. If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the plant's RMP/PSM plan requirements, must be conducted before work begins. \r\nPre-startup Review\r\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RMP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine or ammonia processes that necessitate a change in the process safety information. No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review.

This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed. The Pre-startup Safety Review Form must be authorized before startup.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against an accidental release. The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\r\nThe plant maintenance staff schedules preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. The staff that performs maintenance tasks are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.\r\nHot Works Permits\r\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the chlorine or ammonia processes. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.\r\nThe process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace.

Modifications to the chlorine or ammonia systems will be reviewed before they are implemented to determine if the modification would compromise system safety. An effective change management system will help minimize the chance for an accidental release.\r\nIf a modification covered under RMP/PSM is made, its effects must be addressed, employees must be informed, and the written operating procedures must be updated. The intent is to require that all modifications to equipment, procedures, and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\" be managed by identifying and reviewing them before implementation. A Management of Change Committee that consists of plant engineering, operations, and/or maintenance staff is formed to evaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM. The committee will complete a Management of Change Form that must be reviewed and authorized prior to initiation of a covered change.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, facility management will establish an investigation team. As part of the investigation, the investigation team will prepare an incident report to recommend system changes.\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\r\nThe plant is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP/PSM program.

An internal compliance audit must be conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years for the chlorine and ammonia processes. A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered processes and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP/PSM requirements and audit techniques will conduct the audits. Plant management and the audit team will promptly determine an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and document the corrective actions and the dates by which they must be taken.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Emergency Response Program develops a plan for dealing with a release. OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119(n) and EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR 68 Subpart E require that an Accidental Release Emergency Response Plan be prepared.
