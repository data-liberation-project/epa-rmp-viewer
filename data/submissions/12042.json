Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass POULTRY PROCESSING.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia and is used for Poultry Processing.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 44500.00 lbs..\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from AMMONIA REFRIGERATION.  The scenario involves the release of 44500 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.39 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a compressor shaft seal. The scenario involves the release of 100.00 lbs of ammonia in gaseous form over 10 minute"

The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler systems and emergency shut down systems. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 0.03 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition).  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     What If/Checklist  .  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 Years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shu"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nLUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every     3     years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at LUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prio"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  LUFKIN PLANT/PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.
