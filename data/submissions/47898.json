A separately owned cattle feedlot produces large quantities of \u00bfclean\u00bf manure needing treatment. The anaerobic digester transforms the cow manure into methane a.k.a. biogas. The ethanol plant uses the biogas instead of natural gas or coal in their boilers to produce steam for the facility. The wet cake byproduct from ethanol production is then fed to the cattle. \n\nE3-Mead has started running the anaerobic digesters and plans to begin operations at the ethanol plant soon. Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that the E3-Mead is a new facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information at the facility to date.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nE3-Mead is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, contracted safety audits, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nE3-Mead\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The three aqueous ammonia tanks, final product tank, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area. This containment area is capable of storing 110% of the contents from the largest tank with additional free board for precipitation. A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site. E3-Mead also has an emergency response contractor on call that would be available to respond to a release at the facility and mitigate impacts to off-site areas. \n\nDescr"

      "SummaryText": "iption of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe E3-Mead ethanol plant is located near Mead, Saunders County, Nebraska.\nThe facility will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program include the ammonia solution (greater than 20%) and Denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture.  E3-Mead has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 1.4 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for denaturant is 0.5 miles.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all the contents from one of the three ammonia tanks (30,000 gallons or 78.375 lbs) creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario accounts for the containment area where the tank is located.  The worst- case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 1.4 miles from the center of the plant.  One public receptor, a farmhouse 0.75 miles away, is located within this 1.4 mile radius. The Town of Mead is located 2.5 miles from the facility and outside the area of impact.  The worst-case flammable scenario at the facility is the release of 203,653 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of the entire denaturant tank and gasoline constituents in the denatured ethanol.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within the 0.5 mile radius.\n\nAlthough the E3-Mead ethanol plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating the worst-case and alternative scenarios.\n\nThe facility qualifies for Program 2 for ammonia since public receptors could be impacted by a worst-case r"

      "SummaryText": "elease. The facility is not subject to OSHA\u00bfs Program Safety Management requirements that would trigger Program 3. The worst-case scenario for denaturant does not impact a public receptor and therefore falls under Program 1.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 2, an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required for ammonia.  The ARS is the release of 35,300 pounds from a vessel leak lasting 60 minutes and would create an ammonia vapor cloud.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within the 0.6 mile radius.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nE3-Mead has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite. There have been no accidents at this time.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe E3-Mead facility has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC Plan will also be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes. An emergency response contractor has been hired to assist E3-Mead in mitigating a large release.\nE3-Mead also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  A new employee safety training program is in place and all employees have monthly safety trainings addressing various topics. The E3 Biofuels corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\nA contractor has performed periodic safety audits throughout the construction process. A formal Process Hazard Analysis is pending but planned on at this time."
