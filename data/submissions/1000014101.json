Accordingly, ESG has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the City of Perry WPCP RMP for the chlorine system.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine storage and chlorination process and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  ItA\u00bfs program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine, a regulated chemical under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with chlorine at the City of Perry WPCP and activel"

Refresher training is provided to the employees annually.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe City of Perry WPCP owned by the City of Perry is located in Perry, Georgia.  The 3 MGD facility treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  Incoming wastewater initially passes through automated auger and grit collection systems before being treated in an aeration basin.  Clarification is accomplished via solids precipitation in the clarifiers.  Final effluent is disinfected by chlorination prior to discharge to Indian Creek.  Solids are digested aerobically and de-watered by gravity belt filter press prior to landfill.\r\n\r\nThe City of Perry WPCP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater and because of quantities stored, the City of Perry WPCP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.   As required by the RMP Regulation, ESG Operations, Inc. has conducted the Offsite Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n3.0\t General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \r\nSteps\r\n\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the City of Perry WPCP RMP manual.
