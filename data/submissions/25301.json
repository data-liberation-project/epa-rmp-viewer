The Risk Management program is coordinated by the Risk Managment Program Coordinator.  The Greenway Water Treament Plants Safety Administrator assumes the responsibility for maintaining up to date records of all training activities and also assisting the Program Coordinator.  Training activities will be scheduled to include exercises between Plant Operational Specialist, the City of Peoria/ Fire Department, and the City of Glendale Fire Department, a contiguous City just east of Peoria.  The City of Peoria's  Risk Management Department will provide program oversite as well as providing auditing  and quality control measures.\n\nThe Greenway Water Treatment Plant Chief Operator/Supervisor is designated  as the coordinator for matters related to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Process Safety Management programs(PSM) for the treatment plant.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Greenway Water Treatment Plant modeled both the worst case and alternate release scenarios per E.P.A. published guidelines. Toxic endpoints were developed for both worst case and alternate release scenarios.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency defines the Worst Case release as a release from the largest container on site for a time span of ten minutes.  The intent of the quantifying the worst case scenario, as described by E.P.A., is to encourage  community dialogue.  It is obvious, given the safety considerations present in the design of the Greenway Water Treatment Plant, that the likelyhood of an occurrence as severe as described by the worst case scenario is extremely remote.  Accordingly, the City of Peoria has developed the emergency response plant based upon an alternate release scenario.\n\nA worst case scenario was developed using E.P.A. approved methods.  This type of release is described as a rele"

The distance to the toxic end point is calculated to be 1.3 miles.\n\nThe current emergency response plan was developed based upon the more likely alternate release scenario.  An alternate release scenario was developed based upon the failure of the stainless steel tubing (pig tail)  used to convey gas from the one ton cylinder to the chlorine gas manifold.  A scenario was developed that  modeled a .25 inch leak in this tubing. The leak was modeled for a total time span of 3 minutes.    The results of this modeling produced a toxic end point of .1 of mile, or 520 feet.  A total population of approximately 25  in an area less than 1/8th of a mile could potentially be affected by this alternate release scenario.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe City of Peoria has not had any accidents related to the use of chlorine as a water disinfectant.  The Greenway Water Treatment Plant will commence operation in year 2002.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nThe Greenway Water Treament Plant has a chemical release prevention program in place per E.P.A. Risk Management and OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nThe operations and mainteance manual for the facility, as well as the manual for the chlorination systems contains detailed start-up and shut down procedures.  Additionally, emergency shutdown procedures have been detailed in written form and communicated to all on-site personnel.\n\nAll on-site personnel receive monthly training related to the use of approved Chlorine Institute one ton cylinder repair procedures.  The Chlorine Institute B kit is approved for the containment and transportation of damaged or leaking cylinders.  Joint training is also accomplished with the Peoria and Glendale Fire Departments.\n\nAll employees participate in process hazard analysis (PHA).  Participation in this process provides an opportunity for all employees to identify potential chemical hazards, and suggest alternative methods of daily operation. Additionally, a w"

All personnel are trained to recognize chlorine releases, the extent of the release, and the immediate response required to engage all the approriate emergency response personnel. The treatment plant is highly automated.  Accordingly, all chlorine system monitoring alarms are transmitted, not only to on-site personnel, but also by telemetry to off-site monitoring sites.

      "SummaryText": "The Greenway Water Treatment Facility will be completed in May of 2002.  The facility is a new surface water treatment plant using conventional treatment techniques.  Chlorine will be used to disinfect the water prior to its delivery to the residents of Peoria.  Chlorine will be delivered in one ton containers to the site.  The chlorine building is completely enclosed and a the facility is equipped with a horizontal cross-flow type  chlorine scubber that is capable of neutralizing the entire gaseous contents of one overfilled (2350 pounds) 1 ton chlorine container.  The chlorine storage facility is designed to provide for total enclosure of the vehicle that will be transporting the chlorine to the plant site for off-loading. The City of Peoria is currently providing potable water to all residents from groundwater sources.  Peoria currently uses small  amounts of chlorine at all wells sites (22) and accordingly has prepared the approriate emergency response  documentation, and completed a Process Hazard Analysis that includes Management of Change, MSDS, and employee training programs\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in June of 1996, promulgated Risk Management(RM) regulations (40 CFR, Part 68).  Facilities that store large amounts of hazardous substances are regulated by the Clean Air Act Ammendments (CAAA).  A Risk Management program is required by the aforementioned regulatory Acts.  The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to reduce the possibility of all accidental releases.  Additionally, protection of all public and environmental health risk is a main goal of a comprehensive Risk Management Plan.  The Greenway Water Treatment Plant is one of over 7200 public and private drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities within the United States that use chlorine on a daily basis.\n\nSeventy seven toxic substances and sixty three flammable substances are regulated by the Risk Management program.

Chlorine will be used to disinfect treated surface water in much the same manner as smaller amounts of chlorine have been used at individual well site for the past twenty years.  Chlorine has been proven to be a safe and effective chemical for disinfecting water supplies since the early 1900's.  The City of Peoria envisions the Risk Management program as a vehicle for communicating to the public and planning agencies all emergency response procedures related to the use of chlorine.\n\nGOAL OF MINIMIZING RISK TO THE PUBLIC\n\nReducing the risk of a chemical release is the major objective in the preparation of a Risk Management program.  The City of Peoria has developed a multiple barrier process in order to minimize the potential of a chemical release.  The Greenway Water Treatment Plant will have the following systems in place when it begins its operation in 2002:  \n\nPROPERLY TRAINED ON-SITE PLANT SPECIALIST\nMULTIPLE CHLORINE DETECTORS IN CHLORINE STORAGE AND FEED AREAS\nFAILSAFE EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF BACK-UP SAFETY EQUIPMENT(SCRUBBERS, AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF ISOLATION VALVES).\nAUTOMATICE NOTIFICATION OF ON-SITE AND OFF-SITE PERSONNEL OF POTENTIAL RELEASES\nCOMPLETELY TRAINED ON-SITE PERSONNEL TO ACCESS THE SEVERITY AND POTENTIAL FOR ANY RELEASES\n\nGiven the design of the chlorine facilities, and the state of the art safety equipment, it is highly unlikely that any releases will occur, but an effective emergency response plan has been developed to provide direction to all personnel if a release were imminent.  All Plant Operations Specialist have recieved chlorine safety training that includes communication with the City of Peoria/Glendale Fire Department.
