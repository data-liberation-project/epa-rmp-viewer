Our\nprevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect \nthe public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply \nwith applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency \nresponse agencies.\n\nDFA-Springfield has a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous\nammonia (ammonia) in an amount greater than the threshold under the \nRisk Management Program (RMP) of the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) according to Section 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations (40 CFR 68).  The refrigeration system is designed and \noperated according to good engineering and safe work practices. \nDFA-Springfield has established an Emergency Response Program that \nprovides for trained personnel on call in the event of a release. \nDFA-Springfield is also coordinated with the Springfield Fire \nDepartment and the Greene County Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC).\n\nDFA-Springfield has an excellent safety record in preventing and\nminimizing releases of ammonia.\n\n2.0 Facility description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DFA-Springfield facility processes and packages dairy related\nproducts.  DFA has on-site an ammonia refrigeration system used to\nmaintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to\nprovide cooling for employee comfort.  DFA-Springfield is subject \nto the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system \ncontains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a \nregulated hazardous substance.\n\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative-case release scenarios\n\n3.1 Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nSection 68.25 of the RMP requires a modeling of a worst-case scenario \nof a release of the hazardous sub"

      "SummaryText": "stance. A worst-case scenario \nrelease is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a \nregulated substance from a [single] vessel or process line failure. \nRMP*Comp is used to calculate the greatest distance from the point of \nrelease where a specified toxic concentration is reached.\n\nAt DFA-Springfield, the worst-case accidental release scenario assumes\nan instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel\ncontaining ammonia.  Application of EPA's dispersion modeling software \nRMP*Comp shows that the toxic endpoint would affect residential \npopulations and industrial areas.\n\nThis worst-case release scenario is pre-defined and is highly unlikely\nto occur.\n\n3.2 Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the\nDFA-Springfield facility. From the PHA, the alternative case release\nscenario was determined.  The alternative release scenario is based on \na 1/4\" hole in the process piping.  This failure will conservatively\nassume ammonia will release for 30 minutes from the roof of the \nfacility (30 feet above ground).  Modeling of this release was \nperformed using the EPA's dispersion modeling software RMP*Comp \nand shows that the toxic endpoint will affect residential populations.\n\n4.0 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and \nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDFA-Springfield has an accidental release prevention program to prevent\nand minimize the effects of a spill or release of ammonia.  This \nprogram includes a training program for all operators and maintenance\npersonnel, written maintenance and operating procedures, and a \npreventative maintenance program that includes regular inspections \nand tests of all equipment within the ammonia system.\n\n5.0    Five year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of\nammonia as outlined in '68.42 of the RMP Regulations.\n\n6.0    The Emergency Response Program\n\nDFA-Springfield maintains a written Emergency Respons"
