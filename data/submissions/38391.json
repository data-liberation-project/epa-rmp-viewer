      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPomona Valley Pool Chlor has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response  section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nPomona Valley Pool Chlor maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1971.  The process is located at 2133 West Foothill Boulevard in Upland, California.  The chlorine transfer process for Pool Chlor consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder.  The 20 pound cylinders are then used off-site to treat swimming pools.  The transfer system is equipped with a sodium hydroxide solution scrubber tank to neutralize any chlorine residual in the piping once the transfer process is complete, thereby preventing the chloring gas from escaping to the atmosphere.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 8,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nA worst case release and alternative release scenario have been completed.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of chlorine at this facility over the last five years since June 1999."
