DB Schenker has implemented strict preventive maintenance procedures and an Emergency Action/Response Plan (EAP).  Release of ammonia is specially covered in the Emergency Action Plan and contains all required actions in the event of release of ammonia.  As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted for employees and new hires.  Accidental release prevention, training and awareness are reinforced annually and as operations at the facility dictates.\n\n",

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\nTo save lives.\n\nTo minimize and avoid injuries.\n\nTo protect the environment.\n\nTo minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nDB Schenker maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\n  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DB Schenker facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles anhydrous ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  \n\n\n\n  HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, worst-case and alternate case release scenarios must be completed for the regulated process at the DB Schenker facility.  These off-site analyses have been calculated, and the results are on file at the Ft. Worth facility\n\n\n\n  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DB Schenker facility has implemented a Process Safety Management prog"

The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\n\n\nThe facility also continues to conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it addition, the facility has contacted the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\n\n\n  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to utilize the PSM audit and PHA programs and protocols as well as the Schenker (ARMS) Ammonia Refrigeration Management System to capture and respond to any opportunities that would enhance the safety and operation of the system.\n\n"
