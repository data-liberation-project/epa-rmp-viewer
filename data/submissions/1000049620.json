Incoming product undergoes further processing according to specifications, is stored in a refrigerated storage area, then loaded on to trucks for shipping.  The facility has approximately 395 employees.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in a single stage, self-contained refrigeration system to provide cooling for the production, storage, and shipping areas.  This refrigeration system comprises the process at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years which resulted in death, injury, or property damage to the facility site, or which resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented a prevention program which coincides with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119; EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation, 40 CFR Part 68; the State of Wisconsin's Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration and LP Gas Inspection Report, Ref Code: Chapter 45. The purpose of the program is to prevent occurrences, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances, fire, explosion and other types of catastrophic accidents.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program elements consist of:\r\n\r\n\t-Employee Participation\t\t-Training\r\n\t-Process Safety Information\t\t-Contractors\r\n\t-Process Hazard Analysis\t\t- Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\t-Operating Procedures\t\t-Mechanical Integrity\r\n\t-Hot Work Permit\t\t\t-Incident Investigation\r\n\t-Management of Change\t\t-Compliance Audits\r\n\t-Preventative Maintenance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn Ammonia Response Plan is in effect at the facility which contains pre-planning with local agenc"

There is also provision for emergency response training and PPE issue and inspection.  The Ammonia Response Plan is part of the Emergency Action Plan which contains evacuation procedures, medical treatment procedures, and contact information for company and local resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario Summary\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is a complete release of 21,111 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia from the high pressure receiver located in the ammonia compressor room on the second floor.  Selection of this vessel is consistent with Appendix E (Supplemental Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration) in the General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention because it is the largest vessel on sight and can hold more ammonia by volume than the piping.\r\n\r\nThere are no passive mitigation measures in place.  Ammonia is a liquid under pressure which readily converts to a gas at normal atmosphere and temperature.  The facility is located in a mixed industrial and residential area within the city of Green Bay, WI.  The following assumptions are made about the worst-case scenario:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tthe total quantity of contents in the HPR is released in a 10-minute period\r\n\u00bf\twind speed is 1.5 meters per second\r\n\u00bf\ttoxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/l) \r\n\u00bf\turban setting\r\n\u00bf\tF class weather stability \r\n\r\nUsing EPA's RMPComp software with the above assumptions produced an estimated 1.7 mile radius to the toxic endpoint.  Population data created using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) version 10C, indicates an estimates a residential and institutional population of 32,175 people would be within the affected area.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tsafety relief valves limit operating pressures in the vessel and are on a 5-year r"

Selection of the scenario was made by reviewing a list of 'what if' scenarios from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis which were expected to result in releases leading to off-site odor detection and which resulted in a A, B, or C rating on the Process Hazard Analysis' risk matrix. \r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario selected consists of a safety relief valve on an ammonia compressor lifting resulting in a release of 57 pounds of ammonia per minutes and a duration of 20 minutes.  The following assumptions are made for the scenario:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSystem pressure is 130 psig,\r\n\u00bf\tWind speed of 3 meters per second,\r\n\u00bf\tToxic endpoint of 200 ppm ( 0.14 mg/l) for ammonia,\r\n\u00bf\tUrban setting,\r\n\u00bf\tD class weather stability.\r\n\r\nUsing EPA's RMPComp software with the above assumptions produced an estimated 0.1 mile radius to the toxic endpoint.
