Among those services delivered by the  Fisher Farmers Coop Elevator is the bulk storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia for use as an agricultural nutriant.  The owners and employees of the  Fisher Farmers Coop Elevator are all acutely aewre of the safety precautions necessary for the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia and the other agricultural chemicals at the facility.  It is the policy taht all possible saftey precautions are taken in all day-to-day operations.  Continuous cooperation with the local response units of the Fisher Fire and Rescue team is compnay policy.\n\nFisher Farmers Coop Elevator plns for all conceivable emergencies.  Plans are in place to adress the rection of  Fisher Farmers Coop Elevator employees to correctly react to the worst possible release, a leak that would allow the entire contents of the ammonia inventory to escape.  Ongoing safety trainig addresses the proper response to the relese of lesser quantities of ammonia such as a valve failur or hase rupture.\n\nFisher Farmers Coop Elevator participates with its suppliers and National Associations in a comprehensive safety traing program for its employees Including\n     Fertilizer/46 chemical courses on ammonia safety,\n     VCR taped instuctional cources on ammonia safety,\n     Safety workshhets, and\n     On-the-job traing and evaluation.\n\nFisher Farmers Coop Elevator has a preventative mantenance program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  Key elements of this PM program are the periodic inspection of equipment and periodic replacement before failure of critical safety equipment.\n\nFisher Farmers Coop Elevator maintains close cooperation with the local response authoities.  Annual Exercises are held with the Fisher Fire & Rescue department to ensure the responders are all knowledgable about the workings of the  Fisher Farmers Coop Elevator ammonia "
