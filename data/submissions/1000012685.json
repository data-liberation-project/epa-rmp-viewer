      "SummaryText": "The Glanbia Foods Gooding facility processes cowsA? milk into cheese and whey products.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant to cool water that removes heat from certain steps of the cheese-making process.  The ammonia is also used to remove heat from the Coolers, which are cold storage rooms where cheese is cooled and stored before shipment from the plant.   The refrigeration system is capable of holding 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWhile anhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical, it is widely used as an agricultural fertilizer in Idaho.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant because ammonia has an excellent safety record, is exceptionally energy efficient and, unlike some refrigerants, is not harmful to the earthA?s ozone layer and does not contribute to global warming or air pollution.\n\nIt is the policy of Glanbia Foods, Inc. to pursue environmental excellence and innovation in our corporate strategy and daily operations.  This includes, among other things, striving to prevent the release of substances that cause environmental harm to the air, water, land, or the public.  Glanbia Foods Inc. is required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program at the Gooding facility basically because the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management standard is also applicable to the site.  The Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (EPA) Program 3 Prevention Program includes the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard.  There are twelve elements in the Program 3 prevention program.  These elements are: Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Mechanical Integrity; Management of Change; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Compliance Audits; Incident Investigations; Employee Participation; Hot Work Permits; and Contractors.\n\nTo date, there has never been an accident involving anhydrous ammonia at the Gooding Glanbia Foods plant that caused death, injury, property"

This has been discussed with Lori Capps, County Coordinator of the Gooding County Disaster Services and with the Fire Chief, Mr. Pat Bishop.  Both organizations are aware of our policy to not have Glanbia employees respond to an emergency involving the ammonia system.  The Gooding County Disaster Services (LEPC) and the Gooding Fire District have been provided copies of the siteA?s Emergency Action Plan and have both received the required annual Tier II reports for the site every year.   Members of the fire department have inspected the plantA?s mechanical refrigeration system.\n\nThis facility utilizes International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard for safe operation of mechanical refrigeration systems.  It is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  Glanbia Foods believes that they are in compliance with EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System is designed and installed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Mechanical Code and National Electrical Code.\n"
