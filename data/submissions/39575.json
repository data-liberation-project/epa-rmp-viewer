The facility has a written Emergency Response plan has provided state and local authorities the emergency, planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - a maximum of 140,196 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min. into rural area surrounding plant up to 1.10 miles to endpoint.  The offsite consequences could include approximately 600 residential people.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - A transfer hose failure of Anhydrous Ammonia has potential to release 26,638 lbs. of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs./min. in the urban area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  The offsite consequences could include up to 300 residential people.  The owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire departments and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the environment.  The facility has had no such release in the past 5 years.  Complying with safety standards for storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and completing regular mainenance on the equipment and at the facility will continue to prevent any accidental releases at the Superior Deshler plant at Edgar, Nebraska."
