      "SummaryText": "Overview\n\n\n\nThis document describes F&A Dairy Products, Inc. (F&A Dairy) initial Risk Management Plan (RMP) for its New Mexico Plant. A new ammonia refrigeration system was installed at the plant in 2012. When operating at capacity, the refrigeration system will contain pure (100%) ammonia in excess of the RMP threshold quantity (10,000 lbs for anhydrous ammonia), and the facility is therefore subject to the RMP provisions of 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.150(b)(3) dictates that the owner or operator shall submit a first RMP no later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process. Therefore, F&A Dairy has prepared this RMP for its refrigeration system, and is submitting the RMP before ammonia within the system will be present in a total quantity greater than 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThis document includes all of the RMP elements required by 40 CFR 68. The RMP is not a single document. It is composed of the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, the emergency response plan, an analysis and evaluation of offsite consequences of an accidental release, and other related environmental and health and safety documents and programs. This executive summary presents an overview of the plan and describes briefly the key elements of the RMP.\n\n\n\nThe new refrigeration system at F&A Dairy's New Mexico Plant consists of a number of interconnected receivers, coolers, suction accumulators, pumps, and valves which meet the RMP or PSM definition of a single \"process\". Because the refrigeration process involves more than the threshold quantity of an RMP-regulated substance (ammonia), it is an RMP process. The refrigeration system could have offsite consequences from a worst-case release, and is therefore a Program 3 process. No accidental releases have occurred within the last five years involving ammonia or the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nF&A Dairy is committed to employe"

This commitment is demonstrated by our ongoing development of an accidental release prevention program to cover areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible ammonia releases. \n\n\n\nSource and the Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nF&A Dairy is located in an industrial park just south of Interstate 10 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The facility's primary activity is the processing of milk and cheese. As in many industrial applications, ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant in the cheese factory. Once the new plant refrigeration system is operating at full capacity, anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) will be present above the RMP-threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nF&A Dairy is taking all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are being put in place for the refrigeration system at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nF&A Dairy maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility has conducted an initial process hazard analysis, and will continue to conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with ammonia use are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What If and Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at an interval of five years or less. Any findings related to the hazard analyses will be addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOperati"

      "SummaryText": "ng Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the refrigeration system, F&A Dairy has developed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. This information will be regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nF&A Dairy has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nF&A Dairy carries out documented inspections and maintenance checks on the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined during these checks includes, among other things, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at F&A Dairy to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures associated with the ammonia refrigeration system. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nA pre-startup safety review for the new ammonia system was conducted at F&A Dairy to confirm, prior to placing the equipment into operation, that construction and equipment as well as operating and mai"

These audits will be carried out at least every three years, and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nF&A Dairy has not had any anhydrous ammonia releases, but will promptly investigate any future incident that has resulted in - or could reasonably have resulted in - a catastrophic ammonia release. These investigations will be undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the incident from reoccurring. All associated reports will be retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nF&A Dairy has developed an employee participation plan for the ammonia refrigeration system. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nPrior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of the past safety performance of the contractor is carried out. F&A Dairy informs all contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the ammonia refrigeration system around which the contractor will be working. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur. Safe work practices to control the entrance, presence, and exit of the contract owner or operator and contract employees in the ammonia refrigeration area have also been developed and implemented at F&A Dairy.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention activities, F&A Dairy has safety features on the ammonia refrigeration system units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) "
