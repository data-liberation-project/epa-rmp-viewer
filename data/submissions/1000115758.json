      "SummaryText": "The City of Brownwood (City) operates the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which is located at 3400 Hoover Avenue, Brownwood, Brown County, Texas. The WWTP treats wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial sectors of the City of Brownwood. Chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas are used in the wastewater treatment process at the WWTP. Up to 12,000 pounds (lbs) of chlorine and 8,000 lbs of sulfur dioxide may be stored at the WWTP. Because the stored quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide onsite exceed their respective threshold quantity (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the WWTP developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The WWTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)). A Management System overseen by the City's Director of Utilities is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date; the WWTP Plant Manager also participates in the implementation of the RMP. The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas are prevented.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation. Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP. Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for wastewater operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training. TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials. Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certifie"

      "SummaryText": "d WWTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine or sulfur dioxide storage and feed systems. Certified WWTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine or sulfur dioxide systems are corrected and documented. In addition, the certified WWTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)). Because of these efforts, the WWTP has not had a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)). As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate. These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\r\n\r\nThe WWTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute. The WWTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The WWTP is included in the City of Brownwood's community-wide emergency response plan. Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with \u00a768.93 with the City of Brownwood at least annually, and more frequently if necessary. WWTP operators and staff are trained to contact the City of Brownwood dispatch via 9-1-1 in the event of a release. Brownwood dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit which coordinates the emergency response according to the City's emergency response plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."
