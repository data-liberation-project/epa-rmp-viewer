Simoniz is a non-responding facility for incidents involving hydrofluoric acid.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan and therefore does not have an Emergency Response Plan.  Simoniz maintains an Emergency Contact List and has coordinated with local and regional emergency responders.  As a standard protocol, emergency responders from the regional hazardous materials response team, the local fire department, and a pre-qualified clean-up contractor are to be notified if a response is needed.\n\n1.2 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Simoniz USA, Inc. (Simoniz) facility occupies an approximately seven-acre parcel on the south side of Route 6 and 44 (aka Boston Turnpike Road) in Bolton, Connecticut.  Simoniz blends and manufactures hard surface detergents, cleaners, waxes, and other related products for the automotive, institutional and industrial market places at its facility located at 201 Boston Turnpike in Bolton, Connecticut.  The facility is comprised of four buildings; one used for manufacturing and three used for storage. The manufacturing building contains operations related to batch mixing and filling of containers with final product.  The three storage buildings consist of the Middle Warehouse, located in the central portion of the facility, the Lower Warehouse, located in the western portion of the facility, and a Garage, which is located adjacent to the Manufacturing Building in the eastern portion of the facility. While Simoniz uses a variety of material"

      "SummaryText": "s, the only regulated substance that exceeds threshold quantities at Simoniz is hydrofluoric acid 70%.  As part of its manufacturing process, Simoniz stores, transports and uses greater than 1000 pounds of hydrofluoric acid 70%.  As a result, this plan is focused on hydrofluoric acid 70%.\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Simoniz hydrofluoric acid storage, handling, and transfer facilities addressed in this RMP comply with EPA's accident prevention rule as well as applicable state and local codes and regulations. The hydrofluoric acid transfer between containers and vessels utilizes redundant valves and is in accordance with good engineering practices and industry-specific guidance.\n\n1.4 Five-year Accident History\n\nSimoniz has reported no accidents involving hydrofluoric acid including deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place in the five-year period prior to the submittal of this plan (July 2003 to July 2008).\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program\n\nSimoniz is a non-responding facility for incidents involving hydrofluoric acid.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan and therefore does not have an Emergency Response Plan. As a non-responding facility for incidents involving hydrofluoric acid, Simoniz will notify the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), other outside emergency response agencies, and its spill clean-up contractor to respond to the emergency.  Communication and orientation with the local fire department and LEPC has been completed.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSimoniz plans to implement additional measures in response to its most recent hazard review, compliance audit, and maintenance inspection.  While the majority of these changes will be completed by September 30, 2008, Simoniz also plans to purchase smaller batch tanks for hydrofluoric acid-containing products and to install 110% overfill al"
