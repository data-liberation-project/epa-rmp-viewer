The plan concentrates on chemical release emergencies and specifies emergency response procedures to be followed by City of Sulphur Springs employees. These activities include recognition of the emergency; responding in a defensive manner in the protection of life and property; limited control, containment, and confinement activities; and facility evacuation. OSHA HAZWOPER requirements for achieving this capability are detailed. The plan is constructed generally around the requirements given in 29 CFR 1910.120. It is intended primarily for use in connection with a chlorine release, since that is the facility\u0012s most sensitive chemical from both safety and environmental points of view. This plan is intended for use in conjunction with the Facilities Emergency Action Plan covering evacuation procedures. The Emergency Response Policy is backed up by and is a supplement to Annex Q of the City of Sulphur Springs Emergency Management Plan.\n\nThe facility manager is directly responsible for coordinating the efforts involving this Emergency Response Policy. The facility manager is closely involved with the activities which bear on the facility\u0012s interface with the public and Fire and Emergency Management responders as well. The City Manager has overall accountability for the program. The facility manager and shift supervisors are responsible for directing the activities of the employees involved in emergency responses.\n\nIt is not the intent of the Water Treatment Facility to maintain a complete hazardous materials emergency response team.

The intent of the facility is to maintain a training level no higher than Hazardous Materials Operational Level. This level of training permits the employee to respond at the site of the emergency only under conditions permitting activities within their levels of expertise gained through the training described below. In the event of the use of the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and Office of Emergency Management, employee assistance in the emergency response will be under the guidance of the on-site Incident Commander, which in our case means only along with outside responding entry teams, and only if the assistance can be given within parameters set for the training level achieved by facility employees.\n\nThe facility maintains coordination with the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize them with the potential emergencies which might occur. The Water Treatment Facility has assembled and maintains appropriate materials in the form of manufacturers\u0012 literature, handbooks, pictures, drawings, etc. to demonstrate clearly the layout of the facility\u0012s potential trouble areas and the equipment which the Sulphur Springs Fire Department may need to work with to alleviate an emergency situation. This material will be used by facility personnel, in a safe area prior to entry into the emergency site, to assist the Sulphur Springs Fire Department in their activities, and to show the outside responders what they need to do to mitigate any potential emergency situation.\n\nPeriodic tours are offered to the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize their personnel with our facility. The general public is also welcome to tour the City of Sulphur Springs Water Treatment Facility.\n\nIn any emergency situation, the facility manager will be in overall charge of the f"

The Sulphur Springs Fire Department or Office of Emergency Management will be in charge of actual response activities.\n\nTHE CITY OF SULPHUR SPRINGS WATER TREATMENT FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary activity of the City of Sulphur Springs Water Treatment Facility is the purification of the municipal water supply. The primary regulated product is chlorine.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on a ten minute release of a 2000 pound cylinder of chlorine. The offsite impact could be up to 1.3 miles from the Water Treatment Facility. The number of citizens who might be affected by such a release would depend on the wind speed, direction, and other atmospheric conditions at the time of the release. In the entire 1.3 mile radius around the facility the approximate residential population is 1500 citizens. However, due to the fact that chlorine cylinders being used at any given time are protected inside the water treatment building itself, the offsite impact would be considerably reduced.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a 200 pound pipe leak release of chlorine which would affect only a radius of 0.10 miles around the facility. This area has no residential population. This type of leak can be mitigated by trained plant employees with minimal exposure.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn accordance with the Emergency Response Plan, on-site evacuation resources and facilitators or other management personnel will make the decision as to whether outside help needs to be summoned. This decision will be made on the basis of the type and scale of the emergency and the likelihood of injury to facility personnel, immediate neighbors, nearby residents of the community, and the environment.

This training is designed to provide the ability to contain the release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and  prevent exposures.\n\nThe First Responder Operational Level of training is available through the local office of Emergency Management.

This critique will be conducted by the facility manager and will include input from any of the responding agencies involved. The facility manager will consider the outcome of the critique and incorporate any needed changes to this plan and the operating procedures."
