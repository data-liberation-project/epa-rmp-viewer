Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.\n\nThe Sartomer Beaumont Plant has a RMP Policy to assure adherence to applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations. The Plant could affect outside receptors and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29CFR 1910.119 and thus falls under Program 3 of the RMP compliance requirements.\nThe Facility's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) or Emergency Response program has been developed and outline in standards, procedures, policies and training. The ICP include procedures for notification of local authorities, regulatory agencies and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled.\n\nThe Sartomer Beaumont Facility produces C5 hydrocarbon resins. These resins have many diverse uses.\nThe covered process uses three RMP regulated substances above the threshold, Boron Trifluoride, Flammable Mixture containing 1,3-Pentadiene and Flammable Mixture containing n-Pentane.\n\n\n3.) Worst Case Release and Alternate Case Release \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios at this facility would involve the either the release of Boron Trifluoride to form at toxic cloud or the release of a Flammable liquid vapor that would find an ignition source and produce a vapor cloud explosion.\nThe Alternative Release Scenarios would involve a slow release of Boron Trifluoride producing a toxic cloud that would be mitigated with water with a water curtain and deluge system, or the release of a Flammable vapor cloud producing a vapor cloud fire that would be mitigated by the dike walls and with fire monitors applying both water and foam to the cloud and resulting fire.\n\n\n4.) Chemical Accident Prevention.\n\nThis Facility complies with the PSM Standard. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted on the processes at this Facility. PHAs are also conducted on changes that trigger Management of Change (MOC) process. The original RMP PHAs are revalidated on minimum of a five"

PSM audits are conducted on a minimum cycle of every three years. \nThe Facility and its equipment are designed in accordance with recognized good engineering practices and standards, such as, ANSI, API, NFPA, ASTM and others as applicable. The Plant has extensive redundant systems to ensure safe operations. Operators are trained and qualified to operate the plant. \nManagement has placed safety and protecting the environment as the highest priorities for operating the Plant. There is a Safety and Health coordinator onsite and extensive interaction with the Corporate EH&S staff insured the plant is operated in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\n\n\n5.) Five Years Accident History.\n\nNo process accidents in the last five years that would affect any external public or environmental receptors.\n\n6.) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Facility has the Emergency Response team trained monthly in theory and practice of responding to emergencies. \nThe Community is informed about ongoing emergencies via the LEPC, Sheriff's department and/or Southeast Texas Alert Network."
