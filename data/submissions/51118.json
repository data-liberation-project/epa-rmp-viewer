This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n    Acknowledge the operation of a source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n    Identify hazards\n    Design and maintain a safe facility\n    Prevent releases\n    Minimize consequences of releases.\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. YCEC has prepared and implemented its RMP of the aqueous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\nThe RMP applies to the YCEC facility located at:\n\n875 North Walton Ave., Yuba City, CA. 95993\n\nThis RMP does not apply to the Greenleaf 2 facility, which is covered by a site specific RMP, which addresses anhydrous ammonia issues.\nThe YCEC facility is a gas turbine based peaking power plant facility rated at 48.1 MW (nominal rating). The facility will consist of one (1) LM6000-PC eSprint gas turbine rated at 48.1 MW. The gas turbine is equipped wit"

The facility has ?selective catalytic reduction (SCR)? system, on the turbine, for the control of oxides of nitrogen (Nox) emissions. Aqueous ammonia (19 percent solution) is used as the reaction reagent in the presence of a precious metal catalyst to complete the Nox emissions control process. Aqueous ammonia is stored in a stationary storage tank rated at 12,000 gallons. Aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site approximately twice a year.\n\nSubstance Used/Stored: Aqueous Ammonia 19% Solution (CAS# 7664417)\nFacility SIC: 4911    NAICS Code: 221112\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0 respectively. A brief description of the prevention and emergency response policies is as follows.\n\nAccident Prevention Program Policies and Elements\nThe accident prevention program is implemented through an established set of policies and programs including, but not limited to, the following:\n?    Inspection and maintenance program for all system equipment.\n?    Monitoring of employee and contractor use of the system.\n?    Contractor Safety Program\n?    Emergency Response Plan\n?    Lockout/Tag out Procedures and Program\n?    Hot Work Permit Program\n?    Confined Space Entry Program\n?    Employee Safety Training Program\n?    Compilation of substance information (MSDS)\n?    Periodic compliance audits.\n\nIntegral parts of the prevention program are the following plans: \nHazardous Materials Business Plan ? Injury and Illness Prevention Plan ? Spill Containment Control and Countermeasure Plan ? Hazardous Waste Storage and Handling Procedures ? Hazard Communication Program ? Fire Protection and Prevention Plan ? Hearing Conservation Program ? Respiratory Conservation Program ? Electrical Safety Program ? Proposition 65 Compliance Program ? Forklift and Industrial Truck Program ? Welding, Cutting, an"

Establishment of criteria defining an emergency.\n?    Staff training and responsibility assignments.\n?    Emergency notification procedures (on and off-site)\n?    Evacuation procedures\n?    Emergency response procedures.\n?

System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console. \nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n\n    Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n    Proper operation of all system equipment.\n    Internal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity.\n    Comprehensive personnel training.\n    A written emergency response plan.\n    A written hazardous materials management plan.\n    Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors.\n    Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP.\nThe project has never experienced an accidental release of ammonia or any other hazardous substance in the last 5 years."
