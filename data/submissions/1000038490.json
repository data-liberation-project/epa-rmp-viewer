Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the Battleboro, North Carolina facility per EPA Regulation 40 CFR Part 68.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\nMcLane Carolina is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Nash County Emergency Management which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\r\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\r\nMcLane Carolina has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nMcLane Carolina currently maintains a record of written process safety"

The analyses are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, McLane Carolina maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nMcLane Carolina has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nMcLane Carolina conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations by a qualified refrigeration technician.
