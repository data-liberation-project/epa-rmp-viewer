Wawa\u00bfs Dairy, Warehouse, and Distribution center is committed to the safe operation of our ammonia refrigeration system.  The system was designed and is maintained in accordance with:\n-\tThe American National Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems,\n-\tThe American National Standard: Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration,\n-\tInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAE) Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System,\n-\tGuidelines for Ammonia Machinery Room Ventilation,\n-\tGuidelines for Identification of Ammonia Refrigeration Piping and System Components.\nFurthermore, senior management provides the resources and support necessary to maintain a safe system and ensure appropriate training.  The corporate safety policy is to operate an accident-free environment by performing all our work in the safest possible manner. Management is responsible for preventing injuries and every individual Associate is responsible for following safe work practices.\nThe ammonia system refrigerates our dairy building and automated storage & retrieval system (ASRS).  The facility processes over 700,000 gallons of milk, juices and teas primarily for the Wawa convenience stores.   Raw product is pasteurized and bottled in the Dairy and the finished product is warehoused in the ASRS building and then loaded onto our trucks and shipped out to the stores.  \n\tThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consists of a single stage system that operates at approximately +10\u00b0F (23.8 psig) suction and provides glycol chilling for process cooling, milk cooler automated storage and retrieval area cooling, and cooling of various tanks and silos.  The refrigeration system contains 6 compressors, 4 evaporat"

The release rate would be approximately 2,250 lbs per minute and would affect approximately 8,500 people.  We incorporated various safeties into our system to minimize the potential for such a release; these safeties include ammonia sensors, emergency stop buttons, and ventilation system.  In addition, we added two additional safeties to our silos.  The first safety is a 75 lb pressure valve that relieves into the suction header if the back pressure valve fails.  The second safety is a 100lb factory set pressure switch that will shut down the Clean-in-place (CIP) system if the refrigeration system reaches the set point.  The CIP operator will receive a message on the Sierberling computer system if the 100lb setpoint is reached. \nOver the past five years we focused on maintaining compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations.  We formed a team consisting of management, front-line associates, and environmental health and safety professionals to focus on compliance with the regulatory requirements.  The team meets on a routine basis to update programs, review proposed changes and modification, and address safety issues and concerns.   \n\u00b7\tDWD developed a program to implement associate participation into process safety management policy development and implementation.  Associates (Management and Front-line) are consulted on the development and maintenance of all aspects of the PSM program.

The most recent PHA review was performed on 04/16/04 and all issues were tracked to completion.\n\u00b7\tThe PSM Team developed and implemented standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities regarding the ammonia refrigeration system.

In addition, the SOPs are reviewed in coordination with the management of change program.\n\u00b7\tDWD implemented a training program that exceeds regulatory requirements.  All associates receive an overview of the system and process safety management program, as well as, annual evacuation training.  Furthermore, our ammonia refrigeration mechanics receive the three-year training, but also receive additional training when warranted or requested.  We recently completed an extensive three-day training with our ammonia refrigeration mechanics.    \n\u00b7\tIn order to protect associates, the community, and the environment, DWD maintains strict controls over the work practices of all vendors and contractors.
