The plant to manufacture our products is underpinned by a mechanical integrity program to ensure our equipment is maintained and operated consistent with industry guidelines.\n\nThose who operate the equipment for epichlorohydrin undergo a rigorous in-house training and certification program. Our engineers, chemists and operators have over 40 years of combined experience with this material.\n\nProcess changes or modifications undergo a specific management of change program and start up reviews. All incidents involving Epichlorohydrin, of which we have never had one, are subject to our investigation process.
