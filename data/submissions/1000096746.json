In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\r\n\r\nThese programs help this facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or combination of these activities. This facility has one refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant. The amount of Anhydrous Ammonia contained in this system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RMP standards. \r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at this plant is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant freezer systems. The refrigeration system holds a quantity of 15,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenario: The event that was modeled was the complete evacuation the ammonia system, which can hold 15,000 pounds of ammonia.

Based on the US Census 2000 data, approximately 125 people live within the toxic endpoint radius.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nCSM Bakery Products NA, Inc. believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety. This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards. By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will be operated at optimum conditions. Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits. Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safe operations of the CSM Bakery Products NA, Inc. facility. Also, the accidental prevention program is conducted in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, the CSM Bakery Products NA, Inc.-Bonner Springs, KS facility has not experienced a significant accidental ammonia release.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program\r\n\r\nA well planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release.
