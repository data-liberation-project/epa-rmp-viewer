The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including fire or explosion and is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.\r\n\r\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\r\n\r\n* Proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures.\r\n* Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation.\r\n* Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\r\n* Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\r\n* Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nOiltanking Texas City maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fire, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The facility trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.

(Oiltanking Texas City) operates a marine terminal that stores chemicals including hydrocarbons, specialty polymers, solvents, intermediates, monomers and industrial products.  Processes occurring at Oiltanking Texas City are barge and tanker loading/unloading, storage, transportation and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, requires Oiltanking Texas City to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantities of propylene, vinyl acetate monomer, butane, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, and ethylenediamine stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA approved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) at certain intervals, among which is the onsite presence of a new chemical in an amount greater than its threshold quantity.  The initial RMP Plan for Oiltanking Texas City was submitted to the EPA in November 2004.  The June 2007 revision included updates to terminology to more clearly reflect operations at Oiltanking Texas City, stylistic and grammatical corrections, and expansions of the assumptions made and techniques employed in the evaluation of release quantities, release rates, and impacts.  The August 2007 revision contains changes and updates that resulted from an EPA RMP inspection in June 2007.  This September 2008 revision contains changes and updates that resulted from the Permit by Rule (PBR) 83949 authorization of three new products that conta"
