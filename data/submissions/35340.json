It has been prepared in strict accordance with the provisions outlined in 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4).  The initial RMP, submitted in June 1999, has been updated because a regulated substance, above the EPA-specified threshold quantity, has been introduced into a new process at the Texas City plant.   \n\nThe new process involves the manufacturer of DSIDA (disodium iminodiacetate).  DSIDA is a key raw material in the manufacture of an agricultural herbicide.  DSIDA is not a regulated substance per 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA?s Risk Management Program.  However, some of the raw materials used to manufacture DSIDA are regulated substances.\n\nFormalin is a regulated substance and is one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of DSIDA.  The appropriate hazard assessments have been performed on the design and operation of the new process and issues relevant to formalin are summarized herein.\n\nMany parts of this summary have not changed since the initial RMP submittal in June of 1999.  The importance of these sections to the overall risk management program at Sterling makes iteration vital in explaining our commitment to our employees, community and the environment. \n\n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the Sterling Chemicals Inc. (\"Sterling\") Texas City, Texas facility (\"Texas City Plant\") are engrained in the fundamentals of the process safety prevention program. \n\nIn our Texas City Plant, we presently handle chemicals, which are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities in the production of consumer products also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.

However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at Sterling and we adhere to standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, hazardous chemical inventory reduction and/or elimination studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Sterling.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle and process chemicals, the safety devices inherent to our process designs, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our workers.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at Sterling.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment.  This is no more evident than in our involvement in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (\"VPP\").  Our participation in VPP is a strong example of management's commitment to the safety of our Texas City Plant.  \n\nWe have made extensive improvements to safety and health programs like process safety (prevention) management, emergency preparedness and response, work permitting, and training. \n\nAdditionally, we believe employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  We call it employee ownership and its success is portrayed through our lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved operating efficiencies at the Texas City Plant.

The teams present summary reports of their activities and improvements to senior management each month.  \n\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually weather related, such as hurricanes, or freezes.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of on-site emergencies such as fire, explosion or a chemical release.  Sterling provides the emergency response teams with state-of-the-art equipment and the latest training and procedures.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents and rapid notification to any surrounding neighborhood that may be inadvertently affected by a plant emergency.\n\nWe maintain policies covering five organizations that make up the overall emergency preparedness and response program for the plant.  These five emergency response organizations include: a) Sterling Fire Brigade, b) Sterling Emergency Medical Technicians, c) Sterling Emergency Wardens, d) Sterling Emergency Communications Coordinators, and e) STEPS Emergency Response Improvement Team.  These organizations are capable of responding to onsite and offsite emergencies.

It is received by special equipped truck, designed to transport chlorine one-ton containers.  Approximately 15, one-ton containers may be in use at the Texas City Plant at any one time for the purification and disinfection of water.\nHydrogen Chloride (anhydrous) - Hydrogen chloride is received into the plant by tank car (rail service) from Dow Chemical.  These tank cars are temperature controlled and are constantly monitored while inside the plant to ensure that the chemical remains within safe temperatures and pressures.  Each tank car at the Texas City Plant has a capacity of approximately 145,000 pounds.  At any one time, two tank cars may be onsite at the Texas City Plant.\nHydrocyanic Acid (hydrogen cyanide) - Hydrogen cyanide is a by-product of acrylonitrile manufacturing and is used as a raw material for the production of TBA, DSIDA, sodium cyanide and is also burned as fuel.

It is reacted with ammonia over a solid-fluidized catalyst at low pressure with ammonia to produce acrylonitrile.  Propylene and other flammable materials are supplied to the plant by pipeline.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (worst-case & alternate-cases)\n\nThe RMP rule requirements for identification and selection of a worst-case hazard scenario are prescriptive and ignore most safety systems designed to mitigate an incidental release.  Based on EPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) parameters, Sterling has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic materials handled onsite and one for the flammables handled.  The worst-case is a scenario resulting from an accidental release that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint).\n\nSterling's worst-case toxic scenario involves anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl).  Hydrogen chloride is received via tank car (rail service) into the plant from Dow Chemical.  These tank cars are insulated. Each car may have a maximum of 145,000 pounds of liquid HCl at any one time. A maximum of two tank cars may be present in the Texas City Plant.  This results in a maximum inventory of 290,000 pounds at any one time.  The worst-case assessment for HCl used the EPA's theoretical assumption that the tank cars catastrophically fail and release their entire contents within 10 minutes.  This scenario completely ignores any passive mitigation.  \n\nUsing the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide Document to calculate the greatest downwind distance, it was determined that a hydrogen chloride vapor cloud may extend 16 miles from the plant. \n\nThe worst-case flammable scenario involves the instanta"

The scenario assumes that the total contents of the propylene storage vessel  (130,100 pounds) detonates and results in a destructive blast wave.  The assessment calculated a blast extending out to 1 psi.  The 1 psi damage plot would extend a maximum distance of 0.43 miles from the propylene storage vessel.  \n\nThe EPA rule also prescribes that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemicals are identified.  Each of the regulated chemicals was assessed, using prescriptive EPA scenarios and risk assessment guidelines.  The analysis of the alternate scenarios included mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.  \n\nThe results of the alternate scenario analysis are as follows:\n\n1. The inadvertent failure of the 6\" barge transfer hose during offloading of ammonia into the ammonia storage tank was selected as the alternate case for ammonia.  This failure assumes that the hose suddenly uncouples and releases 12,967 pounds of ammonia.  Evaporation of the liquid ammonia could result in the formation of a vapor cloud extending 0.7 miles from the spill site.\n\n2. The accidental overfilling of the acrylonitrile storage tank 51T18-1.  Acrylonitrile spills from overflow line into concrete containment area. Typical fill rate for the tank is 1,316 lbs/min and this scenario assumes it takes 10 minutes to detect the spill and mitigate it.

In addition to determining MOC notification needs, the MOC Coordinators are responsible for maintaining department MOC logs and records, and ensuring that necessary changes are made to department procedures and process safety information.  \n\nDepending on the nature of the change, Sterling identifies three levels of MOC technical / safety reviews.  Level 1 and 2 MOC reviews require the use of a \"Safety/Health/Environmental Checklist\" to discuss potential hazards associated with the change and are documented on the MOC Form.  A Level 3 MOC review requires that in addition to the use of a ?Safety/Health/Environmental Checklist,? a Process Hazard Analysis be conducted on the change (unless waived by Safety & Health Department), and that a representative from the Safety & Health Department participate.

Every aspect of the drill is critiqued and reviewed to determine improvements that need to be made in each area of emergency response.  All recommendations arising from the critique are tracked until resolved by the ERIT.  \n \n\nPlanned Improvements to Reduce Risk\n\nIn accordance with its risk management program, Sterling Chemicals has conducted continuous self-examination evaluations designed to identify and assess process/operational risk employees and the community.  One of the primary aspects of Sterling?s risk management program is the empowerment of each business unit with the responsibility for continuous safe operations.  \n\nAs an environmentally responsible company, Sterling has implemented a plant-wide risk management program designed to identify risk and assess viable alternatives.

This has led to a reduction of 14,000 pounds of chlorine and 71,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide at the plant site.  One-ton chlorine containers at three separate locations within the plant complex were replaced with safer bleach processes.   The substitution of a different catalyst also led to the elimination of a sulfur dioxide storage tank."
