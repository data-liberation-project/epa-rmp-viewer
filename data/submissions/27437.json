Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Holstein Cooperative Elevator in Holstein are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We coordinate our response\r\nefforts with the Holstein Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Holstein (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\r\nstored is 15,300 gallons (78,734 pounds) at the standard maximum fill capacity of 85%.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP*Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (78,734 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\r\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and an urban topography, the maximum\r\ndistance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 1.5 miles (Figure 2).

Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\r\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \r\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\r\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\r\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.4 mile (Figure 3).
