      "SummaryText": "This is a seasonal/operational facility-operating in the spring planting and fall tillage seasons.  It is located approximately 1 mile west of the village of Walum, ND.  The plant site consists of one 30,000 gallon storage vessel, containing the product anhudrous ammonia.  Customer's nurse tanks are filled on the premises.  It is not operational year-round.  During the off season, the plant is locked and the power is off.  It is in both federal and state compliance.\n\nAll employees are required to attend an annual safe-handling and training school.  A written safety program is on file with the Griggs County Emergency Director and the Hannaford Rural Fire Department.  Both have maps of the plant as well.\n\nA worse case scenario would occur if product were to be released into the atmosphere due to the overfilling or overpressurization of the storage vessel.. Devices in place to prevent this from occurring include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs.  This vessel is never filled to more than 85% capacity.\n\nAn alternative case scenario would be if a customer were to pull away from the loading platform which could result in a ruptured hose.  Qualified, trained personnel are in place to prevent this from happening.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this site in the past five years."
