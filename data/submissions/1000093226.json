      "SummaryText": "TNPC, LCC (TNPC) owns and operates a facility producing mortician chemical products located in Dallas, Dallas County, Texas. The TNPC facility (Dallas Facility) is located at latitude 32.6868? north and longitude -96.9001? west. TNPC has identified that one toxic chemical applied in the plant is listed in 40 CFR ?68.130. The chemical occurs in processes, as defined by 40 CFR ?68.3, such that the quantity in the process exceeds corresponding threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR ?68.130. The toxic chemical covered, i.e., regulated, by the RMP rule is formaldehyde, which is involved in storage tanks and product productions through batch operations. The Dallas Facility uses two (2) formaldehyde-containing products (trade names: Formalin and Formcel), stored in aqueous solutions with concentrations of 37% and 56% (by weight), in Formalin and Formcel, respectively. The total quantity of formaldehyde involved in the process is up to 33,201 lbs. The maximum quantity of formaldehyde stored in one single storage tank is 12,411 lbs. Under 40 CFR Part 68, the threshold quantity for formaldehyde is 15,000 lbs. Since the total quantity of formaldehyde in the process exceeds this threshold quantity, formaldehyde in the process is subject to the RMP requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe process applicable to RMP requirements are also covered by the facility's PSM program and the prevention program for the process consists of the 14 elements of process safety management as required by OSHA 1910.119.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed the emergency action plan and procedures.  The facility also coordinates with local emergency responders, as necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nTNPC is continually improving its operations to provide a safe work environment. Such improvements include training, alarm systems, mitigation measures, and thorough incident investigation/corrective action programs."
