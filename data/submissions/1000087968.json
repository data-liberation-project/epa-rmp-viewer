This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Low Temperature Separation, Fractionation, Propane Storage, Natural Gas Liquids Storage Systems, and the Ammonia Injection System. The Stearns Gas Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE The gas plant is designed to convert sweet field gas into pipeline quality sales gas and natural gas liquids (natural gas liquids and propane). One LPG bullet has a working capacity of 24,000 gallons. The product storage tank has a working capacity of 48,000 gallons. The aqueous ammonia storage tank (T-1300) which has a working capacity of 4,000 gallons taking into account the 50% fill capacity administrative control.\n\n\n\n3. HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS Worst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary Scenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one worst-case flammable scenario has been defined for the Low Temperature Separation, Fractionation, Propane Storage, and Natural Gas Liquids Storage System. One worst-case toxic scenario has also been defined for the Ammonia Injection System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. Alternative Release Scenario Results Summary Scenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one alternative-case flammable scenario has been defined for the Low Temperature Separation, Fractionation, Propane Storage, and Natural Gas Liquids Storage System.  One alternative-case toxic scenario has also been defined for the Ammonia Injection System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. \n\n\n\n4.
