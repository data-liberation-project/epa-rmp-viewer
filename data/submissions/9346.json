The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nPool Chlor Company maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nPool Chlor Company has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Pool Chlor Company to evacuate and to allow the fire department and/or the chemical supplier to respond to the emergency.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company facility has been in operation since 1975.  The facility is located at 13716 Carmenita Rd., in Santa Fe Springs, California 90670.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company facility receives and repackages liquefied chlorine into small 15 pound cylinders that are then used to treat water at local private residence swimming pools.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site is 7 one-ton containers (14,000 pounds).  The entire system including the fill station, one-ton containers, scrubber t"

The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of chlorine from resulting from a 5/16 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company chlorine transfer system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Pool Chlor Company facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nA chlorine sensor is located in the Chlorine Storage Area that activates a facility-wide alarm if chlorine is detected.  An uninterruptible power source (UPS) is used to power the chlorine sensor and associated displays in the case of a power outage.  The chlorine alarm status is monitored by an off-site company duri"

An emergency kill switch is interlocked with a motorized solenoid actuator valve to stop liquid flow from the active one-ton container.\n\nAll one-ton containers are maintained chained to a cradle.  The idle 15 pound cylinders are kept in a locked storage area with the scrubber pump and tank.\n\nAs policy, new Pool Chlor Company employees must be directly observed by an experienced operator while performing the chlorine transfer operation for six months of employment.  This is considered a very conservative approach based on the simplicity of the operation.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no chlorine accidents at the facility since June 1994.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.
