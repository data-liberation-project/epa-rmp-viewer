The emergency response plan is tailored for the wastewater treatment facility owned and operated by WTMA. WTMA employs the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation systems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe WTMA Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) provides sewer service to residential and commercial users in Washington Township and in portions of the Borough of Waynesboro, Franklin County. The WWTP utilizes one (1) chemical onsite which is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention provisions found at 40 CFR Part 68. This toxic substance is Chlorine. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated wastewater prior to its discharge to the East Branch Antietam Creek. \n\nTypically, there are two (2) one-ton containers and two (2) 150-pound cylinders of chlorine present onsite at any given time. These vessels are located in a chemical storage building. The room containing the vessels vents to the outside. The chlorination feed system has an automatic shutoff for special circumstances. A remote alarm system is employed to notify employees of any releases of chlorine gas. Safety equipment is located nearby. The facility is manned 8 hours per day, five days per week, plus 2 hours each weekend day. Gates to the facility are locked when personnel are not on duty, therefore, the chlorination building is not accessible to the public. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis conducted for WTMAs WWTP consisted of two scenarios, worst-case release and alternative release. The parameters for the worst-case release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario are established by EPA. These parameters assume the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over a 10-minute period with default wind speed, temperature and humidity conditions. The only passive mitigation present at the WTMA WWTP is that the chlorine vessels are stored in a building which vents to the outside air. Using EPAs RMP*Comp model, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release is 0.9 miles. The estimated residential population within the 0.9 mile radius of the facility is 1,008 persons based on 1990 U.S. census data. In addition to the residential population, there is a golf course and several commercial establishments within this radius.\n\nThe proposed alternative release scenario assumes a release will occur due to equipment failure. The assumed parameters used in the RMP*Comp model are based on an actual incident that occurred at a similar WWTP, in which a screw on the yoke assembly of the vacuum regulator could not be tightened and a small amount of chlorine was released. It is estimated that the duration of the release was less than one minute and that no more than one pound of chlorine was actually released into the room atmosphere. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release is less than 0.1 miles. The estimated residential population within the 0.1 mile radius of the facility is 2 persons based on 1990 U.S. census data. \n\nA prevention program policy document was developed for WTMAs WWTP in accordance with regulations found at 40 CFR ''68.48-68.60. The facility is classified as a Program 2 facility. WTMAs Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety information, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance procedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies. \n\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of the chlorination system. These SOPs are readily acces"

      "SummaryText": "sible to the chlorine building. Safety precautions include, checking the chlorine detector before entering the chlorine storage room, use of a face mask and other appropriate personal protective equipment, and testing for leaks with ammonia solution. A chlorine emergency kit \"A\" for 150-pound cylinders and a kit \"B\" for 1-ton containers are available to contain small leaks and for minor repairs. Appropriate training on the use of the chlorine kits is provided to all employees. Other training plant employees are offered include: confined space entry, right-to-know, first aid and CPR. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in the employees personnel file.\n\nWTMA has an Off-Site Emergency Response Plan in effect which has been coordinated through the Franklin County LEPC. The Plan provides notification procedures, emergency response procedures, reporting requirements, and coordination efforts of all involved parties. The plan is reviewed and revised periodically to ensure contact names and telephone numbers are correct."
