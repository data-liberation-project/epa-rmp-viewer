Trade Secrets\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen Fertilizer, L.P. (PCS) facility is located on Highway 3115 between Highway 75 and 30 in Geismar, Louisiana.  The facility manufactures liquid Phosphate and Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid and Phosphoric Acid.  The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine and oleum.  The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility.  The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility.  The reported worst case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint.  An ARS was reported for each substance above the regulated threshold.  The scenarios were modeled for releases that are more probable than the worst case scenario. The scenarios reported in the RMP are presented in the following paragraphs. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe objective of the accident prevention program is to develop a proactive approach to the identification, evaluation, and prevention of chemical releases whic"

Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used.  PCS Nitrogen chose the ?HAZOP? (Hazard and Operability Study) and ?What if? processes.  PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances.  The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product.  The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4) Emergency shutdown, 5) Emergency operation, 6) Normal shutdown, and 7) start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.   \n\nTraining Plan\n\nPCS has developed a training plan that provides a guide for the training of each employee in job related and job specific responsibilities.  Each new employee is given a comprehensive orientation-training program and a basic job specific training covering their job duties and responsibilities as they relate to both normal and "

This program outlines the entrance requirements a contractor, sales person, visitor, consultant, vendor or service company must abide by in order to perform work at the facility.  \n\nPre-Start up Review\n\nPCS conducts a pre-start up review prior to the introduction of any OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substance to ensure that new process facilities or modifications to original equipment, controls or safety interfaces of a covered process or covered system do not create a hazard to the facility personnel, civilian population surrounding the facility or the environment.  The review is also intended to ensure that hazards identified in the PHA have been properly addressed by design or procedural changes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe mechanical integrity program establishes and implements the maintenance and inspection programs to ensure the mechanical integrity and reliability of fixed equipment, plant piping, rotating equipment, relief devices, instrumentation and electrical equipment within the covered processes.  The maintenance and inspection program includes and applies to pressure vessels, non or low pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping and piping components, heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, heaters, pressure safety relief valves, emergency shutdown devices, controls, electrical equipment and instrumentation.

The audits are directed by both a ?Corporate Process Safety Assessment Procedure? and an ?Internal Process Safety Assessment Procedure?. Each audit is performed by a team that is knowledgeable of the process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAlthough PCS Nitrogen has a stringent release prevention policy, there have been two incidents within the covered processes at the facility. These are as follows:\n\n1. On March 24, 2008, 2,467.5 pounds of Oleum was released from a 1 - 2\" split in the suction piping associated with the storage tank.  During this incident, one contract worker was taken to the hospital due to inhaltion of fumes.  A shelter in place was activated for the facility.  The contract worker was given a breathing treatment and released.\n\n2.  On October 7, 2004, 652 pounds of ammonia was a mechanical failure of an ammonia pump seal.  Iberville parish emergency response committee intiated a shelter in place of 840 locations within the parish.  There were no injuries reported in the community or in the facility.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the PCS Nitrogen plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP and PSM covered processes at this facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities will help prevent potential accident scenarios. \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention "
