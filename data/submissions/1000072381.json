AECC Magnet Cove is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan. The aqueous ammonia concentration stored at the Magnet Cove facility is less than the minimum concentration for the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, so the aqueous ammonia process is not subject to the requirements under the PSM rule. \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nAECC owns and operates a combined-cycle combustion turbine power plant located in Hot Spring County, Arkansas, herein referred to as Magnet Cove Generating Station (Magnet Cove). The cogeneration facility consist of two natural-gas fired combustion turbines with heat recovery steam generator coupled with a single steam turbine.  To minimize the formation of oxides of Nitrogen (NOX), Magnet Cove utilizes a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control system. The SCR system adds ammonia to the exhaust stream over the catalyst to reduce NOX emissions to elemental nitrogen.\n\n\n\nThe Magnet Cove facility stores and handles aqueous ammonia, which is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The facility receives 30% wt. aqueous ammonia via trucks and is stored onsite in two storage tanks prior to injection into the exhaust steam. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Magnet Cove facility has implemented the Program Level 2 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations"

The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\n     Safety Information\n\n     Hazard Review\n\n     Operating Procedures\n\n     Training\n\n     Maintenance\n\n     Compliance Audits\n\n     Incident Investigation \n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below. These items, their specific requirements, and how the Magnet Cove facility complies with the requirements are addressed in the procedural documents.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Magnet Cove facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Magnet Cove facility will notify the local emergency responders and will evacuate their employees when needed. Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) on September 18, 2018 that identified several recommendations for enhanced process safety. These recommendations are summarized in the PHA report and are currently under evaluation.\n\n"
