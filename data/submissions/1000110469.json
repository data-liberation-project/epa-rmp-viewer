The digestion plant uses feedstock types of agricultural crop residues (Type 1) and manure (Type 2) to produce Biomethane which is injected into a commercial pipeline for use in producing renewable Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). The RMP regulated substance at the SNE Junction City facility is methane. \nThe RMP-covered process at the facility is the Biomethane production process. This includes the digester feed system, digesters, digestate storage tanks, post digestion gas holders, gas upgrading system, and associated pumps, piping, and flare.\nFor the purposes of RMP reporting, methane is classified and modeled as a flammable gas. The quantity of methane in the system is documented in an inventory excel spreadsheet maintained by the facility, which includes the masses of methane in all vessels and interconnected piping. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nShell endeavors in all its activities to promote a quality environment. We recognize that activities at this facility may impact our employees and the surrounding community. Because of this, Shell is dedicated to environmental protection, employee health and safety, regulatory compliance and pollution prevention through a strategy of continual improvement and teamwork.\n\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this facility, our employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.
