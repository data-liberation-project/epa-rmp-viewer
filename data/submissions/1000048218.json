Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of The Dalles Fruit Company to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent with the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\n1.11  The Dalles Fruit Company runs 2 Production shifts of approximately  180 employees each, for 8-10 weeks per year, 8-10 hrs/day, the remainder of the year personnel are only on site as necessary to load & unload storages and monitor system by performing bi-daily inspections.\n\n\n\n1.20  Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\nA?  The Dalles Fruit Company stores, packs, and distributes fruits.  Storage and distribution requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the fruits.  This refrigeratio"

The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nA?  The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 12,637 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n\n\n1.30  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. \n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView 5 (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40  General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThe Dalles Fruit Company complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\n\n\nThe Dalles Fruit CompanyA?s written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.

This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia, and startups, shutdowns, or any system adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n\n\n1.50    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at The Dalles Fruit Company in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.60    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Dalles Fruit Company has a written Emergency Response Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of WISHA Emergency Response regulations, WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan will be reviewed with the Dallesport Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at The Dalles Fruit Company and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.

All system components meet design specifications in ANSI/IIAR, equipment, design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  All pressure vessels are built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, pressure vessels.  Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nAll The Dalles Fruit Company personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\nFuture actions to improve safety include improving training for some plant personnel, scheduling a meeting with local responders and completing more evaluations for contractors who work on (or could impact) the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n"
