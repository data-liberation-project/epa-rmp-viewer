This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and emergency operating procedures and emergency planning and response.  DairiConcepts also has an emergency action plan in effect, which is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\nAmmonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere.  The refrigeration system is designed such that under normal operating conditions, no ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  However, unforseen circumstances or system upset could lead to leakage of a portion of the ammonia from the system.  Given the strong odor of ammonia, even a small quantity of released ammonia will be detected at some distance from the source of the leak.  Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health concerns.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system expansion project at DairiConcepts was completed in October 2005.  The facility is located in the city of Portales, New Mexico.  The complex includes processing areas with auxiliary office space.  The ammonia refrigeration system is used to chill glycol and water to provide refrigeration for the facility's processing areas.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 13,2"

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including most vessels and compressors, while the condensers are mounted on the roof.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DairiConcepts ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn ammonia release occurred at the facility on June 6, 2006, at approximately 9:10 am.  The incident took place during a routine Clean-in-Place (CIP) procedure, in which chilled water is used to cool down hot water flowing through the HTST press.  The flow switch on the outlet of the water chiller failed and shut down the compressors while chilled water was still flowing through the HTST press.  This caused a significant increase in pressure in the chilled water surge drum, resulting in the activation of relief valves in the chilled water system.  A total quantity of 8,000 pounds of ammonia was released from the system's pressure relief valve header into the water diffusion tank, which did not contain a sufficient amount of water to absorb the ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "monia was released to the atmosphere through the diffusion tank's vent and water overflow connections.  The duration of the release was approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, and all employees were evacuated and accounted for.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDairiConcepts has a Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations.  This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  \n\nThe Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous material agency notification and procedures.  This Plan then proceeds to detail the procedures for employees and management in the event of a fire, evacuation, compressor room shut down, blackout, and ammonia release/clean-up.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA PHA Addendum was conducted as a result of the June 6, 2006 ammonia release incident, and a number of recommendations for improving the safety of the system and preventing further incidents were developed.  Some of the items under consideration are as follows:\n\n- Revise the system to shut off the coolant circulating pumps on each system (glycol and chilled water) in the event that the compressors shut down.\n\n- Add a low temperature alarm to the outlet of the chiller to ensure that the cooling medium (currently it is water; but will switch to glycol per recommendation REC) does not freeze, which can result in shutdown of the compressors due to activation of the flow switch on the outlet of the heat exchanger.  Note: This recommendation would only be implemented if the circulating pumps cannot be shut down automatically when the compressors shut down. \n\n- Replace the existing water diffusion tank with a larger tank that has a level gauge and a water temperature sensor.  Add a level monitor to "

Note: this was proposed earlier and it was determined that this would not be cost effective.  However, cooling tower water will be used on the presses once the new equipment is added."
