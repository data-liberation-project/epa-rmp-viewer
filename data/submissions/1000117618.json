As part of Lubrizol's philosophy, we believe in maintaining the health and safety of our employees, customers, and neighbors and in protecting the environment. \n\nLubrizol's attention begins very early in the life of a product with the New Chemical Introduction Process (NCIP) that evaluates and manages all aspects of new chemical introduction from inception to production.  A second process, New Chemical Issues Assessment (NCIA), ensures that pollution prevention, inherent safety, and product stewardship consideration are addressed starting at invention and continuing through development.  A Process Hazard Analysis is performed on all expansions or modifications to a manufacturing process with sufficient risk before being put into service, even if they are not covered under OSHA PSM or EPA RMP. \n\nWhile we emphasize prevention of incidents, we have a very proactive Emergency Preparedness Program.  We have emergency response teams in the plant 24 hours a day.  The plant has about forty people trained in emergency response and a staff of over ninety people who are on an emergency response paging system.  Emergency response personnel at Lubrizol's Bayport facility receive about 1,900 man-hours of training annually.  In addition, Lubrizol is a founding member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), the largest chemical plant mutual aid organization in the world, in the event assistance from neighboring chemical plants is needed.  We maintain an active role in this organization with several employees who provide leadership roles in CIMA.  We work closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC).  We are also active"

The plant is staffed by over 100 full-time Lubrizol employees and more than 30 contractors.  Each year the plant is recognized for community involvement in such areas as Partners in Education, Junior Achievement, Texas Scholars, D.A.R.E., Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Boys and Girls Harbor, and various charitable events. \n\nThe Lubrizol Bayport plant manufactures specialty chemical additives for lubricating oils used in gasoline and diesel engines, automatic transmissions, gear drives, marine engines, and two stroke engine oils.    The RMP regulated chemicals for the facility include Hydrazine (64% soln), Formaldehyde (37% soln), and Boron Trifluoride.  Lubrizol is always looking for ways to reduce the inventory of covered chemicals or substitute a less hazardous reactant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific-Prevention Steps\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLubrizol's Bayport Plant emphasizes prevention of incidents while maintaining an exceptional emergency response program, cooperation with its neighboring chemical plants through Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), and open dialog with the community through participation in the La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Community Advisory Council (CAC).\n\nOur accidental release prevention program starts with hazard identification and risk minimization by our corporate offices at the research and development stages of a product life cycle.  The Bayport plant also has an active Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program. In addition to following the"

In addition, the plant has developed a multi-disciplinary set of Texas Standards for engineering, design, and construction to follow when industry standards and practices are not available.  The Bayport plant is an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR facility.\n\nTo ensure that any new facility or facility modification is constructed according to good standards and practices, the plant has a contractor qualification program. All contractors must receive training from the Houston Area Safety Council (HASC).  Part of the training received at the HASC is site specific to the Lubrizol facility. \n\nHot Work Permits are required before welding, brazing, or any other activity that could generate a source of ignition.  The Hot Work Permit documents that fire prevention and protection have been considered prior to beginning hot work.  A key component of the Hot Work Permit is the requirement to have a \"Face to Face\" meeting at the work site between the craftsman doing the work and the operations representative authorizing the work.  Permits are required for any type of work, including Confined Space Entry, Line Breaking, or just General Work.\n\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) must be conducted before any new or modified facility is put into operation.  The PSSR is a review by a multi-disciplinary team to confirm that the equipment is in accordance with design specifications, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that all employees have been sufficiently trained for the  process change.\n\nOperating procedures have been written for all of our processes, and they identify safe operating limits, consequences of devi"

In addition, operating personnel receive training on the safe operation of their processes and are trained on process modifications as part of the Management of Change process. \n\nThere are also some prevention programs that focus on keeping an existing operating process safe as changes are made.  The Lubrizol Bayport plant follows a formal Management of Change (MOC) procedure.  The purpose of the MOC procedure is to assure that the technical basis of the change is understood and that the impact on safety, health, and the environment are considered prior to the change.  The PSSR mentioned above ensures that the project was installed per the design intent of the MOC.\n\nInspection and testing of existing pipe and equipment is a key part of the plant's \"Mechanical Integrity\" program.  Piping, equipment, and safety critical devices are periodically inspected or tested to assure that they meet the design specifications.  Lubrizol recently initiated a corporate safety equipment program for both specific types of critical equipment and any instruments credited as independent protection layers (IPLs) in high severity scenarios.  This equipment is then identified in our maintenance database as safety critical and assured adequate preventive maintenance.\n\nThe Lubrizol Bayport plant also has a PSM Compliance Audit Program.  The purpose of the audit program is to make sure that all of the prevention programs are working and to provide a tool to stimulate improvement.  A rigorous audit of all program elements is performed at least every three years by a knowledgeable team comprised of corporate and HSES professionals from other Lubrizol sites.  These off-site individuals are able to examine our processes with new and critical eyes.  The most recent PSM audit was performed in December of 2023.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere have been no release"

Security personnel follow specific protocols to make prompt notification to the public through our local LEPC, and use multiple other communication methods to advise our immediate neighbors.  Training is provided throughout the year on various aspects of our Emergency Response Program, and drills are conducted regularly on-site, with our mutual aid organization, and our local LEPC.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lubrizol Bayport Plant was awarded the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) \"STAR\" status in 2004 and has been recertified every five years since. VPP Star facilities represent the \"best of the best\" in safety & health, with injury rates below industry average and proven programs that work.\n\nIn addition to the PHA revalidations for PSM covered processes, the Lubrizol Bayport Plant conducts process hazard analyses for capital projects.  The PHA teams typically include a PHA facilitator, process engineer, operations supervision, and a chemical operator.  Maintenance engineers, environmental engineers, and process control specialists are also frequent attendees whenever their expertise may be needed.  The Bayport plant continues in its efforts to maintain OSHA STAR status through regular safety audits and continuous improvement.\n\nAs part of Lubrizol\u0092s Continuous Improvement journey, Lubrizol has partnered with an outside company to standardize work processes and roles across the operations organization at major sites, with Bayport being the second site.
