Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydorgen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.  \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notificaiton of Industrial Emergency Services (IES) and other local emergency responders so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan Regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen.  Our refinery customer uses the hydrogen.  Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600 degrees F) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydorgen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are t"

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.  \n\n\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees will receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities will be coordinated with IES, a local emergency response services provider.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.  \n\n\n\n"
