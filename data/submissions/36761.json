The PSM/RMP manual is reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nWilliams management understands that it has the duty of providing a safe working environment and of taking measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances \n\nThe GVGP is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility designed to process 100 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas.  The purpose of the GVGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas thereby producing residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid.  \n\nTo effect this separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system.  This process causes the NGL to condense out of the chilled gas stream.  As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is sprayed/injected into the field gas to absorb water.  Ethylene glycol, NGL, and residue gas are then separated in the cold separator process unit.  The remaining gaseous stream is sold as residue gas product and leaves the facility via pipeline.  The NGL stream is stored onsite in pressurized storage tanks prior to being trucked offsite for sale.  The ethylene glycol is regenerated and reused within the process.   \n\nThe PSM-RMP regulated substances handled at this facility are NGL and propane.  Following is the break down of the location of these materials at the GVGP.\n\nNGL Product Storage:        Maximum volume = 90,000 gallons,    (3) 30,000 gallon tanks\nMaximum Weight = 464,202 lbs \n\nThe propane refrigeration and the NGL extraction systems at the GVGP are the processes regulated under the 1990 CAAA Section 112(r).\n\nBecause of the overfill protectio"

Worst case and alternative case release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For a worst case release scenario, the regulations is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one of the 30,000 gal NGL product storage tanks or 154,734 lbs of NGL) is released over a 10-minute period.  No active mitigation can be considered.  Worst case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present and the EPA RMP Comp model was used to determine the distance to over pressure of 1.0 psi for a vapor cloud explosion of hydrocarbon product.  A distance of 0.4 miles to the flammable end point was determined for a release of 154,734 lbs in 10 minutes.  \n\nThe alternative case release scenario was developed based on decisions derived from the process hazard analysis and consists of a release of 30,947 lbs (6,000 gallons) of NGL from one of the 30,000 gallon storage tanks over a 1 hour period due to over-pressurizing of the NGL bullet tank with continued release (and potential failure open) from a 3? release valve on the tank.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  The RMP Comp model was used to calculate the distance to overpressure of 1.0 psi.  A distance of 0.3 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for NGL Release \n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the GVGP PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the Program 3 elements.\n\nEmployee Participation - includes provisions for active participation by plant employees, in the development and implementation of the facility PSM/RMP program as well as ready access to program information, process safety informatio"
