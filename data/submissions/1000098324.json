Each incident that has resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release is promptly investigated, but not later than 48 hours following the incident. Per EPA RMP regulations, a catastrophic release means a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more regulated substances that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\r\nIn the event an incident investigation is required, an incident investigation team will be established and consist of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. Following the investigation, a written report is prepared summarizing the following information at a minimum: date of the incident; date the investigation began; description of the incident and any contributing factors; and any recommendations resulting from the investigation. Affected personnel including contract employees will review the report after the investigation is completed.  Incident investigation reports are maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn emergency response plan has been developed for the Showa site and addresses various types of anticipated emergencies that might occur at the facility.

As a result of the manufacturing process, the chemical chlorine is present at the facility in a quantity exceeding the threshold quantity outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention regulations, also known as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule. The facility has one process that is required to meet the Program Level 3 requirements outlined in the RMP Rule. Showa is committed to operating their facility in a manner protective of their workers, the public, and the environment. As a part of this commitment, Showa has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that complies with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and an RMP program that complies with the EPA's regulation outlined in 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program. This document has been created to satisfy the RMP requirements and to provide a description of the risk management program at the facility.  This executive summary document was created to accompany the Showa facility's initial RMP submittal to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\nChlorination Process - Program Level 3: \r\nChlorine is contained in this process in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR Part 68.
