Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe Performance Foodservice - Arizona facility is committed to managing its operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, contractors and the public. There is one process at the facility that is subject to the RMP requirements, the refrigeration system, due to its use of anhydrous ammonia.  The system is designed with appropriate controls to prevent foreseeable accidental releases. In the event a release does occur, the facility would be coordinated with the Phoenix Fire Department which provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nPerformance Foodservice - Arizona utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at Performance Foodservice - Arizona. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia that is expected to be present in this system is 16,979 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nPerformance Foodservice - Arizona has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, and the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Performance Foodservice - Arizona is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nPerformance Foodservice - Arizona keeps Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation for the ammonia refrigeration system. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia refrigeration system so they can operate and maintain the ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and e"

PSI is available to all employees.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts periodic assessments to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist method. These assessments are undertaken by a team of personnel with experience in the process and operations, and these assessments are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis would also be revalidated if there were an extensive change in the process. \n\nOperating Procedures:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees involved in the process receive basic training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Performance Foodservice Arizona. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule; including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Performance Foodservice Arizona  has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases from covered processes that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage during the past 5 years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan:\nPerformance Foodservice - Arizona has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The emergency action plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. Performance Foodservice - Arizona works closely with the Phoenix Fire Department for response to emergency situations including releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nPerformance Foodservice Arizona is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and overall safety. Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from process hazard analyses, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner."
