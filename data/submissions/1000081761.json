We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Welch Food, Inc. facility is located at 139 South Lake Street, North East, PA. Welch's North East Plant is a manufacturing facility that receives grapes and packages juices, jellies, and jams.  The facility includes but is not limited to processing tanks, piping, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, miscellaneous utilities, and three ammonia refrigeration systems that are located in three separate engine rooms (Tank Room 16, 72 Warehouse and Main System). Also, located at the facility is shipping and receiving docks. \r\n\r\nThe facility has three separate ammonia systems.  The refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000-pound threshold required for our production process and necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Welch Food, Inc. is in the process of implementing numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\r\n\r\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc.) have been developed. For information specific to these see the Operations Manager.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis Re-validation was completed in 2018.  The PHA highlighted some deficiencies in the system.
