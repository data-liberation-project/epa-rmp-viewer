These rules require facilities that contain threshold quantities of materials on a list of toxic and flammable chemicals to create and update a Risk Management Plan for the facility. Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents. In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate \"worst case\" and \"alternative case\" scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical. Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.   \n\n\n\nThis report is the required update of the Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility RMP submitted in 2014. In 2019, Rohm and Haas Chemicals, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow, Inc. rather than The Dow Chemical Company. The Hayward facility will be referenced in this updated RMP plan as the Dow, Inc., Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility.\n\n\n\nThis document comprises the RMP plan for The Dow, Inc., Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility. The plan contains a description of the procedures and provisions used to reduce the likelihood and severity of an RMP regulated substance release or accident. The RMP plan is based upon a complete assessment of the processes, operations, and procedures of the plant and an analysis of potential releases of RMP regulated substances that may occur at the plant and their impacts on the offsite populations.\n\n\n\n1.2    General Description of the Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in the city of Hayward, California at 25500 Whitesell Street near the intersection of State Highway 92 and Clawitter. The plant is constructed on a parcel of approximately 33 acres at the corner of Whitesell Street and Breakwater Avenue. The northern port"

      "SummaryText": "ion of the property consists of the raw material and finished product storage areas, the plant Process Building, a warehouse, plant utilities, and the plant office and laboratory. The southern portion of the property is undeveloped, with the exception of approximately 3 acres that are leased to Trimac Transportation Services. Trimac operates a dedicated truck terminal exclusively for the facility's products. Railroad spurs border the eastern and northern edges of the property and a series of treated wastewater sand filters are located at the northwest corner of the property.\n\n\n\nThe Hayward Facility is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility that produces a variety of non-hazardous water-based polymeric emulsions. This activity is described by SIC code 2821 and NAICS code 325211. Approximately sixty different products are manufactured at the plant using different mixtures of reactants. These products are used by our customers to manufacture water-based paints, floor polishes, adhesives, caulks, and other household and industrial products.\n\n\n\nPolymeric emulsions are produced in two parallel process units and all products are manufactured in batch operations.  The major raw materials used are monomers which are received by railcars, tank truck or deck tank. Each of these major raw materials is stored in a dedicated tank with a dedicated pump that is used to unload the railcar, tank truck or deck tank, and to feed the raw material to the process\n\n\n\nOnce in the Process Building, raw materials are typically pumped to either a mix tank for preliminary mixing with other raw materials and additives or directly into an emulsion tank where they are mixed with additives.  The emulsion mixture is then sent to the reactor where catalyst and activators are added to initiate the polymerization reaction.  Once the reaction is complete, the emulsion is transferred to a drain tank where additional additives may be introduced and the pH of the emulsion can be adjusted. Bactericides"

The products are shipped out of the facility by tank truck, railcar, or in containers. The finished latex product is considered non-hazardous.\n\n\n\nDow, Inc. is a Responsible Care company adhering to the Responsible Care Guiding Principles set forth by a member of the U.S. American Chemistry Council.  Dow has a long-standing commitment to providing a safe workplace, to protect the environment and to prevent accidental releases. \n\n\n\nThe types of risk management programs required by the RMP have long been in place at the facility. Safe operation is a company core value, reflected in many policies as well as in everyday activities of the plant personnel.\n\n  \n\nThe facility is fully committed to maintaining a safe and incident free workplace.  We create a safe workplace by careful planning, use of detailed procedures in our activities and by employing a workforce motivated to maintain a safe working environment.   Examples of facility safety protection measures include:\n\n?    Dow Safety and Loss Prevention Principles in Design of our Processes\n\n?    Dow safety standards on how to conduct critical plant activities \n\n?    Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered plant process control computer\n\n?    Secondary containment for storage tanks\n\n?    Routine drills on pre-defined criteria to ensure plant personnel are ready to respond to leaks and spills\n\n?    Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n\n?    Pressure relief devices to prevent over-pressurization of plant equipment\n\n?    Fire protection and vapor suppression systems\n\n?    Comprehensive written procedures and training programs\n\n?    Highly trained and experienced operators\n\n?

The emergency response plan is based upon Dow, Inc. Corporate Standard and was developed in conjunction with the City of Hayward Fire Department. \n\n\n\nThe plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans, and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a hazardous material spill, protect our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the facility's response plan have been provided to the City of Hayward Fire Department.  This plan provides the requirements for evacuation of the facility; notification of emergency responders, agency contacts and industrial neighbors; emergency first aid or medical treatment for human exposure; coordination of the in-house Incident Command System with local responders; use of personal protective equipment; response to specific events (including external events such as earthquakes); and reporting and notification procedures. \n\n\n\nFacility per"

Numerous facility personnel have been trained as on-site incident commanders assigned the responsibility of coordinating the Facility response to any incident which may occur including communicating response needs with the local Fire Department responders. \n\n\n\nAn incident commander is on duty at the Plant 24 hours per day. The Plant Emergency Response Team annually conducts 20 hands-on drills, including quarterly testing of Plantwide emergency alarm systems, an annual Plant evacuation drill, and actual response to Plant emergency scenarios. All Plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan. The Hayward Facility has participated in City of Hayward Disaster Exercises and Alameda County Pandemic response training and site leadership makes the facility and its equipment available to local emergency responders for Training exercises.  \n\n\n\n1.9 Future Changes to Improve Plant Safety\n\n\n\nThe Hayward facility is continually improving its environmental, health, and safety systems. Worker involvement and company initiatives are used to improve performance.  Through the use of careful safety observations of work in progress, investigations of near miss incidents and worker interviews, the site is enjoying its best safety performance ever. The facility and The Dow Chemical Company understand there is no success without trust and acceptance by our neighbors and community. We know the only way to achieve this is through incident-free performance.\n\n"
