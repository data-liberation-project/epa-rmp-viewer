We operate our business in a manner that conscientiously safeguards our employees, customers, and the community that we operate in.  In striving for responsible environmental, health, and safety (EH&S) stewardship, Wolf Hollow pledges to:\r\n-\tDiligently develop, construct, and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the priority on health and safety.\r\n-\tOperate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances, and statutes as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\r\n-\tContinually measure, evaluate, and improve our EH&S performance.\r\n-\tPromote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors, and vendors.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Wolf Hollow I power plant, located in Granbury, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  Steam is produced from turbine exhaust gases and used to load a power generator.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired combustion turbine exhaust aqueous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust stream.  The aqueous ammonia is stored on-site in storage tanks.  The storage capacity of each storage tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability, but the concentration of the aqueous ammonia is lower than the threshold for PSM highly hazardous chemicals set by OSHA.  Therefore, Wolf Hollow is subject to RMP Program 2 requirements.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nWolf Hollow has developed a set of Management System procedures to manage implementation of the elements of the RMP program.  The management system details the scope, purpose, responsibilities and upkeep of eac"

The documents include information concerning the hazards of aqueous ammonia process technology and process equipment.  This information is updated when changes in the process occur.\r\n\r\nHazard Analysis\r\n\r\nWolf Hollow has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidelines from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  Wolf Hollow has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWolf Hollow maintains written operating procedures that address the modes of process operations including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations, and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel and are reviewed annually by team leaders.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAll operating personnel at Wolf Hollow are initially trained in an overview of the aqueous ammonia process and the procedures for safely operating the process.  Operations personnel receive refresher training every three years, at a minimum.  In addition, all employees are given general awareness training on RMP, the hazards of aqueous ammonia, and general emergency response.\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nWolf Hollow has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown system"

The findings of the investigation along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly Wolf Hollow conducts a performance audit every three years. The plant quickly resolves any deficiencies noted by the audit team and reviews the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\r\n\r\nAdditional Safety Systems\r\n\r\nWolf Hollow has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.  These system include:\r\n-\tPressure relief valves;\r\n-\tShut off valves; and \r\n-\tLevel gauges and indicators.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at Wolf Hollow in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nWolf Hollow maintains a written defensive emergency response program.  The program addresses appropriate aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Hood County LEPC."
