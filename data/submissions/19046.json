The Facility Policy \nThe owners, management, and employees of Lohn Fertilizer are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department company, the local emergency planning committee, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n2.     Facility Information. \n- The primary activity at the facility is storage for sale to farmers. \n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as fertilizer for crop production nutrients. \n- The maximum quantity stored would be 53,000 pounds in a 12,000 gallon storage tank. \n3.     The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario. \na.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage \ntank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.4 miles in a rural area. \nb.     The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .6 miles in a rural area. \n4.     The Accidental Release Program. \nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6 1. I, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occu"
