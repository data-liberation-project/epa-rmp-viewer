      "SummaryText": "PORT ARTHUR:   CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING PLANT\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, operates a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing plant in Port Arthur, Texas.  Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are ChevronTexaco Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.   Both ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nThe Port Arthur Plant employs approximately 189 full time equivalent employees.  This facility is managed by Mr. Richard Cuneo, Plant Manager.   Mr. Bill Andes, Compliance Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-722-4371) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.     \n\nThis facility uses light hydrocarbon feedstocks purchased from refineries to make the following products: benzene, cumene, cyclohexane, ethylene, propylene, butadiene and toluene.  This facility consists of several process units designed to make these products.  Greater than threshold quantities of  regulated flammable mixtures are found in this plant, which includes: methane, hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butenes, butanes, pentenes, and pentanes.  Chlorine is the only toxic regulated substance found in greater than threshold quantity, and is only used in the three "

      "SummaryText": "cooling towers. \n\nThis facility includes (4) RMP covered processes, that we have identified as the Cumene Unit, Ethylene Unit, CU 1741 Cyclohexane Unit and the UDEX/Cyclohexane Unit.  The Cumene, Ethylene and UDEX/Cyclohexane Units utilize chlorine in greater than threshold quantities.  The (4) processes also contain mixtures of flammable regulated substances in greater than threshold quantities and are classified as Prevention Program 3 facilities.   The CU 1741 Cyclohexane Unit is a new process unit, with an initial start up in 4th quarter 2003.  Since the Unit is new, we have only conducted the initial PHA, and there is no accident history or incident investigations for this Unit.  \n\nIn accordance with EPA's guidelines for analyzing accidental releases, Chevron Phillips has performed hazard assessments for flammable regulated substances and chlorine.  \n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substances in a Program 3 process is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a butadiene sphere.  Based on the EPA program, RMP*Comp, this scenario results in the 1.0 psi blast overpressure having off-site impact.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nFor the Alternate Release Scenario, we modeled a release of flammable material from a leaking pump seal in the Ethylene Unit, that continues for 30 minutes before a flash fire occurs.  This flash fire is estimated to have off-site impact.  No credit for any mitigation methods was taken.  Our plant has many preventive and mitigation measures that would greatly reduce the likelihood or severity of a release of flammable materials or a resulting fire.  These measures are detailed in the Prevention Program section of the RMP Plan.\n\nFor chlorine, we used a 10 minute leak that completely empties a cylinder of liquid chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "for the toxic Worst Case Scenario.  The distance for this release is predicted to result in off-site impacts.  The same scenario is used for each of the three cooling towers.  No credit for any mitigation was considered.  The chlorine Alternate Release Scenario is based on a leak caused by a puncture of the system that continues for 60 minutes. The distance for this release is predicted to result in off-site impacts,  assuming no mitigation measures are taken.  Chevron Phillips Chemical Plant has many preventive and mitigation measures that would reduce the likelihood of a release or greatly reduce the impact of a chlorine release.  All calculations of flammable and toxic substance releases were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp software.  \n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.  We are in substantial compliance with the PSM regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment, we are also in compliance with these regulations.  \n\nWe have had no RMP reportable accidents for any RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years at the Port Arthur Plant.  We have had releases of other chemicals and have taken proactive precautionary measures (such as road closings) to ensure the safety of the general public.  \n\nChevron Phillips Chemical is constantly reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work and minimize environmental impacts.  Although we have adopted a program of continuous improvement, we currently have no plans to implement any major changes in our plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems to report at this time.\n"
