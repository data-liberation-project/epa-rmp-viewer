      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRinchem Company, Inc. (Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures.  Its committment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n      \"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment.\"\n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.  Rinchem is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distibutors(NACD) and meets or exceeds all aspects of the NACD Responsible Distibution Process program for the safe handling and storage of chemicals. \n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nRinchem's Winchester Albuquerque Chemical Warehouse at 202 West Wyck Street, Winchster, VA 22601. There is only one substance regulated under 40 CFR part 68 - 29% Ammonium Hydroxide - that is stored above the threshold quantity at this facility.  The Ammonium Hydroxide  acid is not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of totes.\n\nRinchem is located in an industrial part of town with a mixed residential/commercial population nearby.  The Winchester Warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials.  The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe modeling of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios was performed using EPA's RMP COMP program which is a very conservative model.  \n\nThe worst case scenario consists of the largest vessel in the facility containing the regulated substance releasing all of its contents.  This would involve a release from one 220-gallon tote.  No product is stored outside.  The worst case of the contents of an entire tote being released is very unlikely because of the daily inspec"

This scenario was chosen because it would be the most likely situation that could occur.  The same mitigation measures that were considered in the worst case scenario in our building were \nconsidered.  Because releases are cleaned up immediately, the chance of the alternative release having an offsite impact is unlikely.  \n\nAccording to the conservative method used to do the modeling of the scenarios, the estimated distance to toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.1 miles, and for the alternative release it is 0.1 miles.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) engineering controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n\nThe areas of compliance include:\n\n     - having an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan for flammables at the facility \n\n     - having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n\n     - only accepting materials that are in Department of Transportation-approved containers\n\n     - segregating materials according to their hazard class\n\n     - limiting access to the facility\n\n     - performance of daily inspections of the material handling equipment used in the facility\n\n\nThe facility is inspected daily to ensure that all operations are running safely and smoothly and todetermine if any of the containers in storage are leaking.  It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians.  Training is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can p"

The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for \nall new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide at this facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nRinchem has a comprehensive emergency response plan.  The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public.  The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan.  Our employees are fully trained to respond to any release related to the materials stored on-site.  Rinchem's technicians and supervisors attend annual emergency response refreshers where tabletop drills are performed and facility orientation classes are held where evacuation plans and procedures are reviewed.  Facility-wide drills are also performed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our facilities.  Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventative measures are adequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe.  However, we are committed to continue working our corrective action process to monitor and improve the safety of all operations.\n"
