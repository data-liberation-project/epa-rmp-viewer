THE UTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT'S  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS TAILORED TO THE OPERATIONAL PRACTICES OF THE DISTRICT'S TREATMENT PLANT AND THOSE OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY, AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH EPA'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\n\nTHE UTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT PROVIDES OVER 60 %  OF THE DOMESTIC AND FIRE FIGHTING WATER TO URBAN AND RURAL AREAS OF THE GREATER GRAND VALLEY, WITH OVER 900 MILES OF FINISHED WATER DISTRIBUTION PIPELINES.  THE FULL CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT PLANT UTILIZES CHLORINE GAS FOR DISINFECTION.  THE CHLORINE STORAGE ROOM IS ISOLATED FROM THE FACILITY AND STORES A MAXIMUM OF EIGHT ( 8 ) ONE TON CONTAINERS OF LIQUID CHLORINE AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THE CHLORINE STORAGE ROOM IS EQUIPPED WITH, CHLORINATORS, A LEAK DETECTOR WITH AUDIO AND VISUAL ALARMS,  VARIOUS SAFETY EQUIPMENT, ELECTRIC PANELS, AND INSTRUMENTATION.  THE  TREATMENT PLANT IS MANNED 24 HOURS A DAY BY CERTIFIED OPERATORS.\n\nTHE OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS INCLUDES TWO ( 2 ) CHLORINE RELEASE SCENARIOS. THE FIRST IS  IDENTIFIED AS THE  WORST CASE RELEASE,  WHERE IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY IN THE LARGEST CONTAINER IS RELEASED AS CHLORINE GAS IN TEN ( 10 ) MINUTES. THE SECOND SCENARIO IS IDENTIFIED AS AN ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THAN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO.\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION MEASURES WHICH ARE IN AFFECT INCLUDE:\n     -  CHLORINE LEAK DETECTION EQUIPMENT WITH AUDIO AND VISUAL ALARMS\n     -  VACUUM TYPE CHLORINATORS AND CHLORINE GAS PIPING \n     -  LEAK CONTAINMENT WITHIN THE CHLORINE STORAGE BUILDING\n     -  ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEGATIVE PRESSURE WITHIN THE CHLORINE STORAGE BUILDING\n\nTHE U"
