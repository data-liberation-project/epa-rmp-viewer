Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the handling and compression of natural gas.  As part of the facility operation, natural gas liquid (NGL) is separated from the natural gas stream, stored under pressure on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The NGL is the regulated flammable mixture at the facility and contains methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, pentane and isopentane.  These regulated flammable chemicals have a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds each.  The maximum stored quantity of the flammable mixture at the facility is approximately 57,000 pounds stored in one 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 90% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by two automatic pressure relief valves, a back pressure regulator and a high level shutdown.  The facility is normally unoccupied and is located in a relatively remote area.      \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Pr"

The NGL system was designed and installed and is maintained in accordance with applicable State and Federal requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility\u00bfs release prevention program.\n\n1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the NGL storage and process equipment are maintained at the facility. \n\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of NGL.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of NGL.  The procedures generally follow the equipment manufacturer's procedures.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n4) Training:  All employees that work at the facility and handle NGL participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures) and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three years.  The training program is reviewed"

Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations or industry standards.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n6) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of NGL.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \n\n7) Incident Investigation:  Facility management will investigate each incident that results in , or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of NGL.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of NGL in the past five years  that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of NGL except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release are"

This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  The facility Emergency Action Plan was developed following the requirements found in OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, and is reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.  The plan has been coordinated with the community emergency response plan and the local emergency response agencies.  The plan contains procedures for informing the public and emergency responders about a release.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
