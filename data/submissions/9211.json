Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Company Zamora Facility, located at 9580 County Road 93B in Zamora, California, handles both anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia, which are considered a hazardous material.  The properties of these materials make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system contains all the equipment related to the loading, storage, and transfer of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.  The handling area consists of a compressor and piping, valves, and hoses required to transfer ammonia.  They anhydrous ammonia is stored in an above ground 18,643 gallon pressure storage tank that is protected from vehicle impact.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by tank truck.  During the transfer operation, a qualified transfer operator is present to monitor the transfer and to take correction action if required to minimize releases.  The anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from the storage tank to nurse tanks for delivery to off site to the users.\n\nThe aqua ammonia is stored in an above ground atmospheric tank of 30,000 gallons at most 90% full with 27,000 gallons of aqua ammonia.  The aqua ammonia is delivered by tanker truck and pumped by an electric pump to the top of the aqua ammonia tank and the ammonia is released inside of the tank.  The same system used to introduce aqua ammonia to the ammonia tank is used in reverse to transfer aqua ammonia to the t"

      "SummaryText": "ank of the vehicle for delivery to off site users.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for anhydrous ammonia assumes that the full 750,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 75,000 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of  .14 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 9.5 miles.  This release of anhydrous ammonia will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for aqua ammonia assumes that the full 225 0,000 pounds of aqua ammonia is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 22,500 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of  .14 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is .3 miles.  This release of aqua ammonia will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes 5-pound spill due to a transfer hose failure.  The estimated release rate is 5 pounds for one minute.  The distance to the endpoint of  .14 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.1 mile.  The anhydrous ammonia release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario aqua ammonia assumes a 100 pound spill due to a transfer hose failure.  The estimated release rate is 100 pounds for one minute.  The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario for aqua ammonia is .1 mile.  The aqua ammonia release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia systems and the training provided to the ammonia operator"

Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Woodland Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Yolo County Office of Emergency Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  \nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated ammonia process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
