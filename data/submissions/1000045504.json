Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nOlympic Products, LLC believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, should be of the utmost concern in the operation of its business. We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n*Comply with all applicable laws, regulations and standards.\n\n*Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental improvements.  Our complete Health, Safety & Environmental policy statement, signed by our Plant Manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility.  We use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described late in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protect the environment. Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner. This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program. To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and the experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly form the Plant Manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThis facilities primary purpose is to produce polyurethane foam for the automotive and furniture industries. Polyurethane foam is manufactured by combining specific ratios of chemical streams in a mixing chamber where the reacting ingredients are dispensed onto a moving conveyor system. The reacting mixture cures into the form of a sl"

Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck; it is stored in four tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can stored at this facility is 513,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n- Safety information\n\n- Hazard reviews of our processes\n\n- Operator procedures for transferring and storing TDI \n\n- Controls are in place to reduce the hazards of Isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community and the environment. \n\n- Process controls also exist to minimize potential releases (e.g. tank level gauges, high level alarms, high-pressure switches, bursting disk, and system interlocks).\n\n\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\nIn the previous 5 years, no reportable accidents occurred at Olympic Products.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department have copies of an MSDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits our plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release. The following responses are addressed in our plan:\n\n- Proper notifications in the event of a release (internal and external).\n\n- Systematic shutdown of operations.\n\n- Evacuation of personnel.\n\n- First Aid procedures.\n\n- Emergency response team actions.\n\n- Decontamination of personnel and equipment.\n\n- Management of waste material\n\n- Start up of operations.\n\n- Accident/Incident Investigations.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nOlympic Products strives to continually improve the heath and safety of all employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. By implementation of the following activities, Olympic will decrease the risk of exposing personnel and the environment to diisocyanates and increase the safety awareness at the facility. \n\n\n\n- Improved redundant high-pressure relief of the TDI metering systems.\n\n- Enclose and exhaust the TDI metering pumps.\n\n- Install interlocked, redundant high level alarms on TDI bulk storage."
