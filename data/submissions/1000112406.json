A sample accident report can be found in the Process Safety Management Files. \n\n-Emergency Response Program-\n\nThe Bunge Oils facility's employees will not respond to a large accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, and, therefore, an Emergency Response Program is not required. In place of the Emergency Response Program, the facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan and is included in the community's emergency response plan.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is kept with the Process Safety Management Files. \n\n-Continued Safety Improvements to Safety-\n\nFrom ongoing PSM meetings and programs audits, the facility continues to address and improve safety. These items will be assigned responsible parties, tracked and implemented, or closed out with proper justification, to ensure the facility's ammonia refrigeration systems continue to operate safely.\n\n1.\tHire an additional experienced technician or further train maintenance to Operator 1 level\n2.\tConduct weekly PSM meetings\n3.\tEvaluate and address findings and recommendations generated from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, Mechanical Integrity Audit, and Compliance Audit."

Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n-Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled-\n\nThe Bunge Oils facility includes one ammonia refrigeration systems to provide process cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in each of the systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds. The maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year is 32,000 lbs. of ammonia. Since an ammonia release from the systems could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated, the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n-The Prevention Program-\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses on efforts at the Bunge Oils facility to contain the refrigerant inside the systems. The goal is to reduce the risk of injury and promote safer practices at the Bunge Oils facility.

The Risk Management Plan for the Bunge Oils facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system. Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. \n\nThe submission is due to the need to resubmit the RMP for a change that requires a revised PHA (\u00a7 68.190(b)(5)) and a change that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis \u00a7 68.190(b)(6). The RMP resubmission was completed on 3-28-24.\n\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies-\n\nThe Bunge Oils facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment and property. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Bunge Oils facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Action Plan. The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.
