The facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for food storage cold rooms and freezers.  RFBP recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, the public, and the environment.  To this end the facility has an active safety program with a full time HSE Leader.  The program includes accident prevention, training, respiratory protection, first-aid and other programs designed to prevent accidents and comply with KY OSHA regulations.  The facility maintains an active PSM/RMP program.  Ammonia release detectors and emergency shutdown systems are installed to detect and minimize releases.  The computer controlled system is operated by trained operators who are also trained in emergency response procedures.  The facility maintains up to date On and Off site Emergency Response Plans which are coordinated with commuinity response plans and responder activities.  SOPs have been developed for employees of the refrigeration system.  Operators are trained to respond to potential system problems.  The facility utilizes cold storage and freezer areas that are maintained at FDA required temps by use of a refrigeration system which uses NH3 as the refrigeration gas.  Over 400 employees are employed at the facility.  The EPA model RMP Comp has been used to prepare worst case scenario release models for NH3 releases.  The worst case release involves the loss of the entire contents of the largest vessel in less than 10 minutes.  The affected zone is predicted to be within a 1.2 mile radius.  The more likely release will affect a .2 mile radius.  The refrigeration system is subject to PSM which requires PSI info, PHA, safety reviews, training, PMs, and emergency response procedures.  The faclity has had 2 reportable releases in the past 5 years.  One on 5/31/04 due to a malfunctioning valve and on 7/19/05 due to human error.  "

Plans include notification and reporting procedures, community alerting, evac procedures, and follow-up protocols.  The facility has 16 trained responders.  Sufficent equipment is available to allow hazmat responses in conjuction with local authorities.  Improved employee awareness and training are stressed."
