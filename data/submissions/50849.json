The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.  \n\nThe Elk City Oklahoma Pipeline, LP Elk City Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE    \n\nThe Elk City Gas Plant is located on Route 4 near Elk City, Oklahoma and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n2. Regulated flammable products:\na. Methane\nb. Ethane\nc. Propane\nd. Butane\ne. Isobutane\nf. Pentane\ng. Isopentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Elk City Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 175,000 pounds (45,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in a High Pressure Surge Tank. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.46 miles. Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public"

Passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Elk City Gas Plant is a vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of the flammable mixture from a 2? hole at the bottom of the High Pressure Surge Tank (9,061 lb/min).  The release is expected to be isolated by plant operation personnel within 15 minutes or by automated plant shutdown system to shutdown all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare. The alternative release scenario results in a distance of 0.10 miles to the Lower Flammability Limit. There are no public receptors in this area.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAtlas encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n4. Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\nEmployees have access to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Elk City Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These technical documents address the following:\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n3. Maximum intended inventories\n4. Upper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\n6. Identification of all "

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators? procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nElk City Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically exams for potential hazards puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists with a team of the Atlas?s employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The team?s findings are forward to Atlas?s Management for resolution.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Elk City Gas Plant maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee?s suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nTraining\n\nElk City Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.

Because some contractors work on or near Covered Process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazard that they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n1. A process overview\n2. Information about safety and health hazards\n3. Emergency response plan requirements\n4. Safe work practices before beginning work\n\nIn addition, Elk City Gas Plant Management will evaluate the contractor safety program and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nThe Elk City Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
