The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.  \n\nThe Elk City Oklahoma Pipeline, LP Elk City Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE    \n\nThe Elk City Gas Plant is located on Route 4 near Elk City, Oklahoma and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n2. Regulated flammable products:\na. Methane\nb. Ethane\nc. Propane\nd. Butane\ne. Isobutane\nf. Pentane\ng. Isopentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Elk City Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 175,000 pounds (45,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in a High Pressure Surge Tank. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.46 miles. Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public"

Passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Elk City Gas Plant is a vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of the flammable mixture from a 2? hole at the bottom of the High Pressure Surge Tank (9,061 lb/min).  The release is expected to be isolated by plant operation personnel within 15 minutes or by automated plant shutdown system to shutdown all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare. The alternative release scenario results in a distance of 0.10 miles to the Lower Flammability Limit. There are no public receptors in this area.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAtlas encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n4. Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\nEmployees have access to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Elk City Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These technical documents address the following:\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n3. Maximum intended inventories\n4. Upper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\n6. Identification of all "

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators? procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nElk City Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically exams for potential hazards puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists with a team of the Atlas?s employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The team?s findings are forward to Atlas?s Management for resolution.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nElk City Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAt least every 3 years a Compliance Audit addressing all OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of Elk City Gas Plant. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are completed. Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a description of existing features applicable to prevention of accidental re"
