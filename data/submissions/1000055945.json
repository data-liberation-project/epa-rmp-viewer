In the event of a spill, release, near miss, or threatened release involving ammonia, evacuate the immediate area and report the situation to the area supervisor.  If appropriate, hit the system emergency stop button.\r\n\r\n2.         Area supervisor will contact the Operations Manager and the Maintenance Manager.  If both are not available (e.g. off-site), then the highest ranking supervisor on-site is contacted at the front office.  If needed, the Operations Manager and Maintenance Manager are contacted using pagers and/or telephone calls.\r\n\r\n3.         When the evacuation alarm sounds, all employees should follow the evacuation procedures and evacuate the plant to ensure their safety. Currently, the facility evacuates its employees by the use of an alarm system and personal communication.  It is the responsibility of the management and supervisory staff to notify all employees of the need to evacuate.\r\n\r\n4.         Call 911 to ensure public safety.  The Maintenance Manager or his designated alternate will evaluate the situation and determine appropriate response measures (e.g. use remote emergency switch to shut down equipment, clean up spills, etc.).\r\n\r\n5.         Notify the appropriate agencies as required by law.\r\n\r\n6.         Within 48 hours, a complete investigation must be performed.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility recently completed a detailed ammonia refrigeration system mechanical integrity inspection. These items have been prioritized and are being addressed by the maintenance department. In addition, Kemps continually looks to improve the implementation procedures in place for managing the ammonia refrigeration system."

From our beginnings as a small creamery in Southeastern Minnesota, Kemps has extended its roots to include the manufacture and marketing of fresh milk, premium ice cream and frozen yogurt, frozen novelties, sour cream and cottage cheese through retail supermarkets and food service channels. Headquartered today in St. Paul, Minnesota, we operate five manufacturing facilities in Minnesota and Wisconsin and have over 1,126 employees.\r\n\r\nThe Kemps LLC facility in Farmington (Kemps) maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated incident commanders for the facility.  Kemps has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect to provide the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tKemps, LLC is located at 15 4th Street in Farmington, Minnesota.  The facility is approximately 0.1 miles North of Main Street.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial, industrial and residential areas.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility uses approximately 12,500 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and production.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nKemps ammonia refrigeration system has many safety f"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf           IIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\r\n\u00bf           IIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\n\u00bf           IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\r\n\u00bf           IIAR, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\n\r\nThe facility, including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with various automatic process controls which ensure safe and efficient operation of the compressors, condensers, evaporators and other process equipment, suction accumulator, and regulating valves.  In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event the system experiences a very high pressure situation.  In case of an ammonia leak, ammonia detectors will provide an alert.\r\n\r\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119 and a Risk Management Program for compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the Kemps accident history during the past Five-Year period, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds (February 2011 - February 2016) nor any that meet the RMP definition of accident. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM"
