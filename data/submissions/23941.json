Primary Energy (PE) is implementing a prevention program based on the PSM program implemented at the facility.  As part of the implementation, PE has completed a thorough pre-startup safety review for the new ammonia system, as well as a checklist health and safety review.  In addition, PE is planning to conduct employee training on the hazards of handling ammonia on an ongoing basis, as the number of employees is expected to increase in the coming months.  PE is in the process of developing the operating procedures for the ammonia system, incorporating safe work practices for conducting hot work, lockout/tagout, and confined space operations at the facility.  PE is also developing a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia system equipment to ensure the equipment is maintained in optimum working condition; PE uses equipment manufacturers? recommended maintenance tasks and schedules, as well as past operating experience to complete the mechanical integrity program. PE has developed a contractor safety program for contractors hired to work on the ammonia system.  Finally, the PSM written program incorporates the facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments, the neighboring B.P.

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Whiting Clean Energy Cogeneration facility in Whiting, Indiana owned and operated by Primary Energy are in the process of installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit which will utilize ammonia for reduction of NOx emissions. The ammonia for use in the SCR process will be stored in a 6,000-gallon storage tank located at the facility. At full capacity, the tank can store 29,000 pounds of ammonia. Since the facility will be storing more than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, the SCR ammonia process is subject to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations codified in 40CFR Part 68.\n\nAmmonia is an easily liquefiable colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. It is listed by the USEPA as a regulated toxic substance for release prevention.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Primary Energy has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to ammonia.  The facility completed detailed Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) through checklist analyses and a complete Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed in April 2001 using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as experienced facilitators from URS Corporation, an outside consulting firm.\n\nPrimary Energy is committed to the safe operation of SCR ammonia system at the Whiting facility. Primary Energy?s implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes preventive maintenance programs (mechanical inte"

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the systems. The PSM program also includes a program for the evaluation of contractors. \n\nThe PSM written program incorporates the facility?s comprehensive emergency response plan in concert with the adjoining B. P. Amoco Whiting Refinery facility and place special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations such as the Lake County LEPC.\n\nSince the system has not been formally commissioned, Primary Energy has not completed a compliance audit of the PSM program.  A compliance audit of the newly implemented PSM program will be completed in the first quarter of 2002. \n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Primary Energy undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases from the largest vessel in the system ? the 6,000-gallon ammonia storage tank.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nAs required by USEPA regulations, the worst-case release scenario was assumed to be the complete loss of contents of the 6,000-gallon storage tank containing 29,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  In this analysis no passive mitigation measures were assumed. The USEPA guidance for defining a worst-case release scenario for unmitigated release of gas is to estimate the release rate over a 10-minute period "

Thus, the ammonia emission rate from the worst-case release scenario used was the loss of 29,000 lbs of ammonia averaged over a 10-minute period, i.e., 2,900 lbs/min.\n\nUSEPA?s public-domain RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/lit (or 200 ppm). The model predicted a downwind distance of 2 miles as the distance to the toxic endpoint due to the specified worst-case release. Based on LandView III output, the total population within the potential exposure area is 6,000 with the following public receptors being potentially impacted ? schools, residences, recreation areas and industrial areas. It should be noted that the potential offsite impact due to a release is greatly minimized on account of the location of the facility which is bounded by Lake Michigan on the north and east. Since almost 40 percent of the area within the circle of influence defined by the distance to the toxic endpoint as the radius is over Lake Michigan with the majority of the remaining area of influence bounded by an industrial estate, potential offsite impacts are greatly reduced.\n\nOnce the facility is commissioned, Primary Energy employees will thoroughly inspect the ammonia system per the recommendations of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and the provisions of the written Process Safety Management (PSM). This will greatly minimize the chance that the tank will fully discharge its contents in a release and minimizes the potential for an offsite impact.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nFor the Whiting facility, the alternative release scenario was assumed to be the structural failure of a 2-inch pipe filled with ammonia at 25 psig beyond the confines of the concrete dike. Assumed active mitigation (e.g., use of emergency shutdown systems etc.) starts within a reasonable time after the accidental release begins. For this analysis, the total release duration is assumed to be the time peri"

The model predicted a downwind distance of 0.2 miles as the distance to the toxic endpoint due to the specified alternative release.

The scope of the PSM program encompasses various facets of release prevention; e.g., it engenders employee participation, increases employee awareness about the hazards of handling ammonia, establishes safe standard operating procedures and enhances access to process safety information.

Thus, there is no operational history during which the facility has experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe PSM written program incorporates the facility?s comprehensive emergency response plan in concert with the adjoining B.
