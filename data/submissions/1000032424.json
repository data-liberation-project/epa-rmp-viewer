THE CROWN COOLING II, RISK& PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThis is to inform interested persons, including employees, that Crown Cooling II has a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal Level, Title 40 CFR Prt 68), and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials\", and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall, worker and public safety.  We have : (1) prepared a unified program"

The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.  DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\n\nThe Crown Cooling II Plant #2 facility is an agricultural pre-cooling and seasonal cold storage facility for vegetables and citrus.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  The two rooms are designated as combination storage and \"precooling\" rooms.  All of the rooms are equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides substantial control, monitoring and alarm capability. In addition there is a complete redundant operating system in the event of a computer failure.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room or refrigerated zone, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted in the room bunker.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperatures gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the primary accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to refrigeration compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessel is pumped into a liquid"

      "SummaryText": " transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.  The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water filled diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, emergency switches are located near the mechanical room that will turn off equipment and equalize pressure in the system if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the Crown Cooling II facility are an integral part of the overall business.  It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.  Crown Cooling II has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/"

In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment.\n\n\n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such a evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.  \n\n\n\n4.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nCrown Cooling II has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n\n\n5. EMERGANCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans\". Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response\", and Title 29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond defensively to a release.  Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control.  The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personnel protective equipment.  To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the Hazwoper regulations will take place within the next year.  All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\n\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n6.

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Crown Cooling II continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\n\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Crown Cooling II now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \"living document\".  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Crown Cooling II employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Crown Cooling II will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety.\n\n"
