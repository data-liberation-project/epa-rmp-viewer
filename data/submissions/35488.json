      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe City of Dallas Water Utilities maintains a policy of safe water and wastewater treatment plant operation, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment. They cooperate with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote effective contingency planning in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs.\n\nAs part of this policy, Dallas Water Utilities maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and ammonia.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Dallas Water Utilities first submitted a RMP for the Elm Fork WTP to USEPA in 1999.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  The following information summarizes the Elm Fork WTP 2004 update and resubmission:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Elm Fork WTP uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  The plant receives raw water from Lake Grapevine and Lake Lewisville, by way of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n1. Chlorine\nThe Elm Fork WTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 205 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in two Department of "

      "SummaryText": "Transportation certified 90-ton rail cars and a 35-ton emergency storage tank, which is only filled with 30 tons due to administrative controls.  The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\nThe majority of chlorine is delivered to the Elm Fork WTP by railroad on rail spurs and is stored in the two 90-ton railroad tank cars.  A chlorine tanker truck supplies chlorine for the emergency tank, when necessary.  The rail cars and the storage tank is located at the Chlorine and Ammonia Building.\n\nThe existing chlorine feed facilities at the Elm Fork WTP consist of inside the storage tanks (two 90-ton rail cars and one 35-ton emergency tank), liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, three evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, three chlorinators, and a scrubber system.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n2. Ammonia\nThe Elm Fork WTP stores ammonia in two 20-ton stationary tanks.  As an administrative control, these tanks are only filled to 85% capacity.  Therefore, the maximum amount of ammonia stored onsite at one time is 34 tons.  \n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Elm Fork WTP by a tanker truck and is stored in the tanks located inside the storage building.  Ammonia is removed as a liquid under pressure from one tank at a time.  As the supply in one tank empties, the supply is manually switched to the full tank.\n\nThe existing ammonia feed facilities at the Elm Fork WTP consist of the two 20-ton stationary tanks, liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, two evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, ammoniators, and an ammonia scrubber system.  A release of ammonia gas could potentially occur at the ammonia storage area or at the ammonia process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn May 2004, Dallas Water Utilities and Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. reviewed and updated the offsite consequence analyses at Elm Fork WTP.

The results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Elm Fork WTP was reviewed for the period from June 1999 through June 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Dallas Water Utilities maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and ammonia at Elm Fork WTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safety Information\nDallas Water Utilities has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Elm Fork WTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Elm Fork WTP who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine and ammonia processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  A chlorine and ammonia hazard review using the ?What-If? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Elm Fork WTP plant management and staff familiar with the process? operation and maintenance in May, 2004.  The results of this review identified changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine and ammonia systems. The changes that most"

Operating procedures\nDallas Water Utilities have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and steps for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes at Elm Fork WTP consistent with the safety information. Elm Fork WTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nAll Elm Fork WTP staff currently involved in chlorine and ammonia processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Elm Fork WTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Maintenance\nElm Fork WTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA?s risk management rule requires that Elm Fork WTP complete a compliance audit for it?s risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and go"

The results of this audit, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nElm Fork WTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Elm Fork WTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Elm Fork WTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas Fire Department HAZMAT Team, in the event of an emergency. \n\nIn 2004, the Dallas Water Utilities will update and incorporate this ERP and sections of the risk management program into an ?a"

The ICP format will minimize duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements and will eliminate confusion for Elm Fork WTP staff that may have to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n- Purchase repair components for the ammonia tanks for use with the C kit.\n\n- Install an improved chlorine scrubber with enough capacity to scrub one 90-ton rail car.  The current scrubber system can only scrub approximately 5,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n- Provide a schedule of inspection and maintenance for the chlorine rupture disks and tanks.  These are not currently inspected on a regular basis.\n \n- Install an automatic shutoff at the chlorine evaporators.\n \n- Check the capacity of the ammonia scrubber to ensure that it is adequate.\n\n- Create SOP for emergency shutdown in case of tornado or other emergency.\n \n- Relocate the eye wash in the chlorine building to outside the door.\n\n- Consider additional preventative maintenance and replacement of chlorine equipment."
