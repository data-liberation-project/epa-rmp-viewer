Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Tenaska Alabama Partners, LP Lindsay Hill Generating Station in Autauga County, Alabama handles anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our emplyoyees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  \n\n\n\nTenaska's emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The emergency respons plan includes procedures for notification of the Local Emergency Response Commission (LEPC), the Alabama Department of Emergency Management, and the National Response Center.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of the generating station is to produce electric power from combustion of natural gas.  Fuel oil may be used as an alternative fuel.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced during combustion.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in a single storage tank.   Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted for the worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios.  The findings from this analysis was submitted to the EPA in this RMP plan.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Tenaska generating station compllies with EPA's Acciden"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable ammonia storage and handling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system are thoroughly trained using Tenaska's documented training program.\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life of this facility.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nTenaska's emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the Autauga County Emergency Management Agency and the local Fire Department."
