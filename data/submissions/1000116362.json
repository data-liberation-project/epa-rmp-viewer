California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the process hazard analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the hazard assessment.\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is a significant accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.

The Maintenance Manager and Director, Regulatory Compliance are to be called if not on site for support.  Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Maintenance Manager, if not on site, for instructions.\n\nThere are additional full-time managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Manager that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.    \n\nA-2\tSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe original California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant was built in 1928 and expanded and modified in 1994,1996 and 2020. The covered process provides product cooling, and short-term storage for milk and associated milk products and by-products. The refrigeration system is operated up to 24 hours per day throughout the year to meet production needs.\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Fresno County on a contiguous property.

Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nA-4\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM program elements. The Risk Management Program (RMP) is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nKey objectives of California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMaintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information.  The facility has retained the original manufacturer OEM manuals, equipment drawings, etc. for reference purposes and aid in maintenance activities.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nProvide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers several potential problems including mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant.  \n\nStandard Operating Procedures\nWritten procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated.

The maintenance schedule shall follow industry RAGAGEP, manufacturer recommendations, and/or industry practice to help maintain the system.  The facility utilizes outside contractors to perform routine and emergency maintenance on the system.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nThese procedures require that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The main categories reviewed are the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nFollowing completion of a change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.  This confirms that the following program elements have been updated, revised, or carried out: process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\nCompliance Audit\nThis audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements has been implemented and properly documented by California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant personnel.

The facility investigates releases and near misses that could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Recommendations are addressed and corrected by facility management.  Reports are kept for at least five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployee involvement is critical to the success of the prevention program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the prevention programs (e.g., process hazard analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operator's day-to-day activities.  \n\nSecond, all California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant employees (direct hires and contract) receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. \n\nHot Work \nIf welding, grinding, or other hot work occurs, a Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated hot work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.\n\nContractor\nFor maintenance contracts, California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.  All contractor training and documentation associated with this element, is managed through ISNetworld.\n\nINJURY AND ILLINESS / ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the EPA's 40CFR68 Risk Management Plan and OSHA's 29CFR1910.119 Process Safety Management Program.

The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\nThe facility shall coordinate with outside parties through drills.

In addition, Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\nDetailed plans have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  Under the best circumstances, all areas (zones) inside the building should be brought under control within 20 minutes of an ammonia release or breakdown, if personnel are on site.  Small releases should be brought under control immediately.  \n\nThe plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the system.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified.  \n\nFacility hazardous material personnel do not enter an IDLH condition which is currently 300 ppm for ammonia. Responders are trained to the air purifying respirator level and trained to retreat at the IDLH level.

All personnel not trained to respond will evacuate to the meeting areas and"

The prevention program has been updated as part of the 5-year program update and re-submittal process.  Several PHA studies were conducted at California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant and the study team made recommendations for additional safety.\n\nRefer to the most recent process hazard analysis and compliance audit for the scheduled list of improvements to reduce accidental releases either in process or planned for at this time."
