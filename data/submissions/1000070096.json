Operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain a process using intrinsically safe tablets. The operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they reflect current operating practices, including changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and facilities. To guard against outdated or inaccurate operating procedures, the procedures are certified annually to validate that these operating procedures are updated, current and accurate.\r\nTraining:\r\nTraining provides employees, including contractor employees, with an understanding of the nature and causes of problems arising from process operations and increases employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to the process.  An effective training program significantly reduces the likelihood and severity of incidents arising from process operations and is instrumental in preventing small problems from leading to a catastrophic release, accidents or events.  Employees receive initial training on the process and will receive refresher training every 3 years.  All training is documented in the training module of the BasicSafe system.\r\nAll employees, including contractor employees, involved in operating the process are covered by this policy and procedure.  This part identifies the minimum training requirements for personnel involved in operating the process.  Training for maintenance personnel is addressed in the Mechanical Integrity section of the manual.  \r\nContractors:\r\nContractors will play a role in the facility and the work that occurs.  There is an application, review, and monitoring process for all contractors whose activities have potential to impact process safety.  The process will involve both re"

The company will also periodically evaluate contractor performance and will maintain training and injury documentation.  Additionally, there is specific training for the contractors to ensure they are knowledgeable in the hazards and appropriate action plans associated with the work they will be executing.  \r\nPre-Startup Safety Review\r\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review will be completed for permanent and temporary changes prior to placing these changes in service and starting the facility.  The PSSR will be documented inside the MOC in the BasicSafe system.  The PSSR checks to ensure that all the required changes were implemented as designed, all required PSI has been updated and all required training has been completed. The PSSR will be completed prior to the commissioning and startup of Raven.   In addition, PSSR will also be implemented if required in relation to future MOC before the equipment/process impacted by the change is restarted.\r\nAdditionally, a PSSR will be performed prior to initial startup or startup following a shut down for maintenance of the facility.  The PSSRs after the initial startup will typically only be performed only for the portions of the system that have had maintenance performed.  If the entire facility is shut down and cooled down in relation to a maintenance / MOC, a complete PSSR will be performed.  The PSSRs for Raven will be executed as an operating procedure and there will be a verification that all instrumentation and critical equipment are functional prior to re-introducing highly hazardous chemicals into the process if the relevant hazardous chemicals where removed.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity (MI) program describes the policies, plans, and procedures for maintaining the ongoing mechanical integrity of equipment at the"

The purpose of the MI program is to assure that equipment used in the processing, storage, and handling of highly hazardous chemicals is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases, accidents and unplanned events.  The MI program provides written procedures, training, inspection and testing, and quality assurance measures aimed at minimizing the risk of a hazardous release.\r\nA list of process equipment covered by the MI program is available in the Computerized Maintenance Management System, eMaint that is provided by a service provider to a number of similar petrochemical facilities.  Please see https://www.emaint.com/ for additional information regarding eMaint.  Any piece of equipment that meets the criteria to be included in the MI program will be designated as such.\r\nHot Work\r\nHot work permitting is used to establish safe work practices for control of ignition sources to reduce the likelihood of fires and/or explosions resulting from improper hot work operations. Hot work is defined as any work or use of equipment that may introduce a source of ignition in an area where flammable materials or vapors may be present. The Hot Work Permit is found in the Permit Tool section of BasicSafe.\r\nA permit must be issued prior to hot work operations in or near any process areas. The permit will be issued for a specific task on specific equipment. The employee or contractor conducting any type of hot work must request a Hot Work Permit in the control room. If Hot Work can be moved to a non-process area, such as the workshop, this should be considered first.  Note that Raven will take over the responsibility for Safety in regards to hot work at Mechanical Completion and that there are no plants to bring in large amounts of ethylene or butene-1 to the facility prior to Mechanical Completion.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nAll modifications or changes (other than replacement in kind) to the process is managed through a module in Bas"

The system defines responsibilities, steps for assessing risks and approving changes, requirements for reviewing designs for temporary and permanent changes, steps needed to verify that modifications have been made as designed, time limit authorizations for temporary changes, and steps for organizational and emergency changes.  A Change is any modification or alteration of equipment, materials, process conditions, procedures or organizational structure at the facility.\r\nEmployees who operate a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process must be informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process or startup of the affected part of the process. If a change covered by these procedures results in a change in the required process safety information, such information also must be updated accordingly. If a change covered by these procedures changes the required operating procedures or practices, they also must be updated.\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nIncident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and implementing the steps and lessons learned' to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The desired outcomes of an incident investigation are: the identification of the contributing factors and root causes of the incident; recommendations for changes in practices and/or facilities to mitigate the likelihood of future occurrence; and, communication of incident reports and resulting changes to affected personnel.  \r\n\r\nAll personnel are responsible for the timely reporting of any incident observed, including near misses.

This includes ascertaining whether the internal procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed to ensure process safety.\r\nThe audit is a self-evaluation of the facility relative to regulatory requirements to verify their suitability and effective implementation. The focus is on PSM systems and the policies, procedures and practices developed to implement the systems.  \r\nFollowing each audit, management will promptly review audit findings.

To date, Raven have had no accidents to report.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program \r\nRaven facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan and is considered a non-response facility under current regulation meaning that the employees will not directly respond to emergencies of a certain severity.  Instead, Raven will rely on trained experts to manage these emergencies. During operations, including during commissioning and start-up activities, Raven will have an agreement with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) to respond to plant emergencies requiring mitigation of uncontrolled releases or fires involving hazardous substances. \r\nAll Raven employees have received portable fire extinguisher training to respond to incipient stage fires. Raven Operations and Maintenance Employees have been trained, and will respond to any spills or releases as First Responder Operations Level individuals. \r\nEmergency notification drills are planned quarterly for the site commencing at Mechanical Completion when Raven takes over the responsibility for safety of the facility from the EPC Contractor. This emergency notification drills are performed to ensure employees are efficient in the actions necessary for response to emergency situations.
