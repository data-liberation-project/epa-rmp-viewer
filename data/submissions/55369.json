      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nHumboldt-St. Vincent Elevator has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations of the Clean Air Act in June 1999. Humboldt-St. Vincent Elevator is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Humboldt-St. Vincent Elevator staff is highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and distributing anhydrous ammonia.\n\nHumboldt-St. Vincent Elevator has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System. Humboldt-St. Vincent Elevator\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Humboldt-St. Vincent Elevator is located at 1500 Highway 75, Humboldt, Minnesota in the county of Kittson. The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored in 30,000-gallon and 25,000 gallon storage tanks (bullets) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 420,000 pounds.\n\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. \n\n-Risk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent po"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n   -Automatic/Manual Shutdown\n   -Well designed Relief System.\n   -The history of the Humboldt-St. Vincent Elevator (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Humboldt-St. Vincent Elevator to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 420,000 lbs.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM. As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to EPA RMP"
