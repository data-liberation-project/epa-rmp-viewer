These documents address chemical properties and associated \n\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/ \n\nconfiguration information.  The Canadian Valley Complex currently has a Process Safety \n\nManagement/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Coordinator on site that assists in maintenance of up-to-date \n\nprocess safety information.   A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is \n\nreadily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any \n\nnecessary process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and \n\nemergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). For \n\nspecific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process \n\nparameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operating Procedures.

The goal of each investigation is to \n\ndetermine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a \n\nsimilar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to \n\nprevent a recurrence and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective \n\nactions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked \n\nuntil they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and \n\nthe investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by \n\nthe findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports \n\ncan be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Canadian Valley \n\nComplex periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required \n\nby the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least \n\nevery 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  Any audit findings are \n\ndeveloped by the audit team and forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions \n\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final \n\nresolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nC"

Following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of \n\naccidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at \n\nthe Canadian Valley Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent \n\npotential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Canadian Valley Complex has safety features on many units to help:\n\n(1) contain/control a release\n\n(2) quickly detect a release, and\n\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: Release Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n4. Curbing and/or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control \n\nsystem)\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.   Personnel trained in emergency action.\n\n2.   Fire extinguishing equipment.\n\n3.   Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Canadian Valley Complex began operations in April 2014.  This Complex has had no RMP reportable accidents over almost 5 years of operation.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Canadian Valley Complex maintains a written emergency action plan which is in place to help \n\nprotect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

      "SummaryText": " The plan identifies steps to be taken \n\nin case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, \n\nevacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency \n\nresponse agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition, the plant has procedures that \n\naddress maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as \n\ninstructions, which address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training on \n\nthese procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan \n\nis updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other changes that affect the Canadian Valley Gas Complex.  The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which \n\nincludes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Canadian Valley Complex has been coordinated with \n\nthe Canadian County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic \n\nmeetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government \n\nofficials, and industry representatives.  The Canadian Valley Complex has around- the-clock \n\ncommunications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, \n\nPolice and Sheriff's office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an \n\nincident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to \n\nperiodic LEPC meetings, the Canadian Valley Complex conducts emergency drills that involve the \n\nLEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to \n\nlocal emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Canadian Valley Complex resolves findings from PHAs, regula"
