Ascend - Decatur Plant is one of the chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company.  Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently approximately 220 Ascend employees and approximately 100 permanent resident contractor employees.\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 651.82 acre tract (peninsula), 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River (river mile 302). The peninsula is shared by guest operations.  Linde occupies 4 acres, Calphine 20 acres, Toray 50 acres, Ineos Nova 21 acres.  Over 300 acres are presently in use by Ascend.  The remainder acreage is the old Acrilan footprint which is currently unutilized.\n\nThe plant was designed to primarily manufacture Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber. In April of 2005, the production of Acrilan permanently ceased at this site. The bulk chemicals in the production units and tanks were subsequently removed, with completion occurring by the end of the Third Quarter of 2005. There are only two chemicals (both are toxics) in our remaining processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. They are:\n\n    Acrylonitrile (AN) -- A raw material to make nylon intermediate chemicals.\n    Propionitrile (PN) -- A by-product from manufacture of nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\nThe main raw material for production of nylon chemicals (i.e., AN) arrives at the plant by barge on the Tennessee River. The principal products are non-RMP chemicals, and are shipped from the site by barge, railc"

The site maintains a list of the scenarios considered, as well as those reported, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario. This information is available at the Decatur site to appropriate inspectors.\n\nFor alternative release scenarios (ARS), an evaluation of the most likely system failures was conducted. This information has been documented, and is available at the Decatur site to appropriate inspectors.\n\n 4.0  General Accidental Rele"

Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank.\n *  An operator would notify the site coordinator immediately.

The sump level alarm would trigger.  This alarm can only be turned off at a location next to the tank, so someone would have to notice the release while acknowledging the alarm.  Low level alarm on the PNT Tank would go off.  The area is inspected at least twice daily.\n *  Tank dike would contain the material and prevent ground contamination.  Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank if the release occurred while loading a railcar.\n *  An operator would stop the flow of material into the tank and immediately contact the site coordinator.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\n\nThere were two agency reportable spills/releases of Acrylonitrile and Proprionitrile in the last five years from the specific processes covered by the regulation that met the criteria for being reportable under 40 CFR Part 68. Minor releases of some of these chemicals occurred from other processes; however, there were no exposures to individuals onsite or offsite, no onsite damage to equipment, and no environmental impacts onsite or offsite as a result of these minor releases.\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nWe at the Decatur plant use several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.   Following are some of the different types of audits, inspections and reviews that are conducted:  PSM and Non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and Insurance surveys and audits, Environmental and Industrial Hygiene audits, RC 14001 audits, and supervisor audits.  We conduct pre-engineering safety audits and inspections on new process before any engineering work is done.  During the phase of construction walkthrough safety inspections are completed.  Pre-startup inspections are done before the process is started.\n\nAscend at Decatur, Alabama is very dedicated in preparation just in case we might have an emergency.  We have approximately 29 firefighters across the 5 shifts that we work.  These firefighters train 48 hours annually at the site on incidents involving flammable liquid fires, interior fire fighting, hazardous communications, incident command and others.  Our firefighters receive off-site training at fire schools such as LSU and Texas A&M.  We have two fire trucks on-site.  One fire truck is equipped with foam and another truck is"
