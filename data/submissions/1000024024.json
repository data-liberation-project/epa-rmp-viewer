Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. Save A Lots employees are involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.

Save A Lot operates many retail grocery stores throughout the states of North and South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia and Kentucky that are supplied through Save A Lots Distribution Center located in Lexington, NC. Save A Lots Distribution Center when fully operational will employ 65 people and will utilize anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of perishable grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n   \nPursuant to RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management  (PSM) Regulations Save A Lot has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using the General Contractor, the Refrigeration System Contractor, the Control System Contractor, Local Fire Department personnel, Save A Lot personnel as well as an experienced PHA facilitator (engineer) from ComPSM an RMP/PSM consultant.\n\nSave A Lot's implementation of the PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on t"
