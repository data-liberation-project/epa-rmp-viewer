              "Description": "Panda Hereford Ethanol's facility is governed by a set of OSHA and US EPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of any hazardous substance, or is a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and to the environment. These regulations include: 1.) 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention 2.) 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management and 3.) 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). The key concepts in PHE's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of al employees.  PHE has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management (PSM) plan.  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.  Employee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by PHE management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the process hazard analysis (PHA) for the ammona system.  PHE will maintain a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize risk of a release.  PHE is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee will be provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, PHE is planning to conduct regularly scheduled safety training for all employees monthly.  Additional training will be provided to operations personnel for the system they are responsible for.",

The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to HRE employees, the public, and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by implementing site specific operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the local emergency response providers (HRE Fire Department). This plan covers all HRE activities at this facility.  Included in this RMP are regulatory requirements, process information, a list of chemicals which exceed the threshold values stated in 40 CFR 68.130, chemical release scenarios, emergency planning information, employee training information, and all additional information needed as is required with 40 CFR Part 68.  Specifically, release scenario modeling was done using EPA's RMPComp software.  The following chemicals at the HRE facility are included in this plan: ammonia (anhydrous), pentane, isopentane, butane and isobutane (denaturant).  \n\nHRE uses anhydrous ammonia in mix tank #1 at the front end of the cook process to adjust the pH of the mixture within, as well as to add a nitrogen source to the slurry.  The ammonia is stored in two-30,000 gallon coded pressure vessels.  The worst case scenario assumes a 10 minute release of one vessel's entire contents to the environment, excluding any active mitigation.  The alternate case scenario assumes a transfer hose connection failure during chemical offload; passive and active mitigation (deluge system) are factored into the response time"

      "SummaryText": ".\n \nPentane, isopentane, isobutane, and butane, are present in the natural gasoline that is used to denature the final ethanol product.  Denaturing the ethanol renders it unfit for human consumption.  The natural gasoline is stored in a 220,000 gallon internal floating roof tank.  The worst case assumes a pressure buildup within the tank leading to a vapor cloud explosion with a 1 PSI to overpressure basis.  The alternate case assumes a transfer hose connection failure during chemical offload; passive and active mitigation (deluge system) are factored into the response time.  Additional information on how anhydrous ammonia and denaturant are used in the process and their associated equipment is included in this RMP.\n\nHRE's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\n"
