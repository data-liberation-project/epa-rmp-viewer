      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nThe Messer Lima facility, owned and operated by Messer, LLC is located at 1680 Buckeye Road, Lima, OH 45804. The management and employees of the Lima facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\nThe facilities primary operation is the production of Carbon Dioxide where the covered material, anhydrous Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system. Ammonia is received and stored in a high-pressure receiver and process refrigeration system that contains up to 15,400 pounds of anhydrous Ammonia in the total system.\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release and the alternate release scenarios were conducted and endpoints were determined using EPAs RMPComp* 1.07. Description and results may be reviewed by contacting the facility.\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia. The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\nWritten process safety information was developed for the Ammonia system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards. This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard"

The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA will be updated at least every 5 years.\nDetailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be taken. The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process. The operating procedures are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees. The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHAs hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200. Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information. Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties. The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms. Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening. In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction computer assisted training (IMSS), videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction. Employees are encouraged to actively participate. The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure they possess the necessary skills and knowledge via a computer-based system call TRACCASS which includes written tests, obs"

The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience. In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified.\nPre-Start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point. The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained. The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle Ammonia has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases. The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.\nHazardous work or nonroutine work is controlled in a consistent manner.

The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. Linde's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage its employees/contractors in performing this type of work.\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities. MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes. This would include both technical and mechanical changes. Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\". A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.\nProcess incidents which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of Ammonia are investigated, including \"near misses\", within 48 hours of the incident. The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mistakes. Process incidents are investigated by a Team which include both management and employees and is multidisciplinary. An incident report is prepared following the investigation which includes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The Facility Manager is responsible for ensuring that all report recommendations are completed or resolved by those individuals responsible for follow- up.

The plan complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and has been coordinated with local emergency response agencies.\nThe facility receives a compliance audit in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every three years. The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions, and practices to ensure compliance. The Team uses an audit tool to document each audit step and ensure an effective audit is conducted. A Protocol Policy has been developed to ensure that proper follow-up is accomplished.\nMesser will make available all information, including any Trade Secret information as it relates to compliance with this regulation.\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to ensure that it is current. Changes are made and reviewed if deficiencies are found. The site does not have trained Emergency Responders at the technician level, however, Messer maintains trained technician level Emergency Responders on 24hr. call throughout the US.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
