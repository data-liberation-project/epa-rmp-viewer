This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, which includes two storage tanks with a capacity of approximately 87,000 gallons each and associated piping.  The butane blending system was designed and constructed by MCE Blending LLC consistant with the applicable provisions in  the National Fire Protection Association 58 (2001Edition) Code for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The facility's worst case scenerio is the failure of the system's two manifolded 87,659 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (92.4% capacity at 60 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion due to a simultaneous and complete failure of both tanks.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.7 miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenerio is a pull away accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.
