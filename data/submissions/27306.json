The butane blending operation is subject to certain requirements set forth in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, which includes two storage tanks with a capacity of approximately 87,000 gallons each and associated piping.  The butane blending system was designed and constructed by MCE Blending LLC consistant with the applicable provisions in  the National Fire Protection Association 58 (2001Edition) Code for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The facility's worst case scenerio is the failure of the system's two manifolded 87,659 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (92.4% capacity at 60 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion due to a simultaneous and complete failure of both tanks.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.7 miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenerio is a \"pull away\" accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.

In the event of an emergency involving the butane blending system, it is the facility's policy to contact the Shawnee Fire Department and request their assistance, as necessary.  The facility maintains a trained fire brigade and hazardous materials response team to respond to minor accidents and the initial stages of potentially significant emergencies.  In addition, the Allen County LEPC is notified, as necessary.  The facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Allen County LEPC.
