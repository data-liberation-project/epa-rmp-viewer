Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  O.K. Foods strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate, training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Heavener Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nO.K. Foods has two independent systems at this site.  The largest system contains 18,445 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 26,324 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.

It is assumed that the entire contents of the debone plant receiver are released as a two phase flow (gas and aerosol).\n\nDistance to endpoint: 2.2 miles \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario would be a release of approximately 1,000 pounds of ammonia.  \n\nDistance to endpoint:  0.1 miles (RMP Comp).\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nTo date, this O. K. Foods facility has had no reportable releases in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Stan Sharp, O.K. Foods-Heavener Plant Manager.  Mr. Sharp will administrate in conjunction with the O. K. Foods management and personnel including the Safety Director and the Environmental Director.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Le Flore County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Heavener Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe O. K. Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  All training is coordinated, comprehensive, and documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe work very closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Heavener Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCurrently, O. K. Foods train"
