      "SummaryText": "McGrawsville Feed & Grain is a small company that stores grain for the local farmers and uses one 18,000 gallon propane tank to dry the grain in the fall of the year. The propane tank is located at the rear of the grain bins and away from any buildings. The Amboy fire Department has made saftey checks at the site and is aware of the propane tank. McGrawsville Feed and Grain has an emergency plan on site and the employees receive  training. The owner and employees of McGrawsville Feed and Grain know all the residents of the area and can contact them by phone in case of a fire. Where the tank is located and distance to the nearest house makes it unlikely that the propane tank or its contents will pose any problems for the residents. The tank is maintained by the supplier of the propane."
