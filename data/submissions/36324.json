The quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2) at the facility are greater than the Threshold quantities (TQ) of 5,000 pounds.   This is EPA's criteria for requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the manufacturing process and consideration is also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the plant as well.\n\nSO2 is considered toxic and methane is considered flammable by EPA standards.  The same properties that make SO2 valuable for beet sugar processing, and methane as a fuel supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community and/or environment.  Safety depends upon the mannner in which we handle chemicals; combines with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.  \n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is this facility's intent to uphold industry standards in the design, construction and operation of the facility.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, we have trained personnel and equipment ready for response in the event of a spill of hazardous materials.  It is also our policy to notify the Crookston Fire Department (via the 911 system), and request that they respond to the emergency if the emergency is beyond our capabilities.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSO2 is used at the plant for processing the sugar beets into some of the various products.  SO2 is received and stored in a 18000 gallon pressurized tank.  Inventory of SO2 held at the facility is a maximum of 162720 pounds held in the tank along with residual in process piping. Liquid SO2 passes out of the tank, through process piping, t"

It then flows into the process endpoint.  Approximately 75% of the SO2 is used in the diffuser water supply and the other 25% is used in the sulfitation of \"thin juice\".\n\nPhysical access to the plant is restricted by chain link fencing and manned security.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and will all applicable state codes and regulations.  ACSC takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered processes are all considered.  By conducting thorough evaluations, accidental releases are prevented and the consequences of releases are minimized.\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the RMP standards, ACSC intends to prevent releases of hazardous substances and minimize the impacts of accidental releases, especially into locations that could expose employees, the community or the environment to serious hazards.  Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n- Maintaining Process Safety Information (PSI): ACSC maintains up-to-date technical information about safe operating limits of the processes and associated hazards of the chemicals involved.\n- Conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA): ACSC performs technical analysis of the plant's processes in order to anticipate what might go wrong and recommend approached to minimize the possibilities and affects of such occurrences.\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): We have written technical and administrative procedures used to operate the plant safety.\n- Training: ACSC provides employees"

We do business, and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting high standards for accident prevention.  ACSC has also developed a risk management system which identifies specific job positions and responsibilities to ensure proper management and implementation of this RMP.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of SO2, or other toxic/extremely hazardous chemicals in the past 5 years, which have resulted "
