To this end, the management strongly supports the implementation of safe work procedures for all aspects of operation, including the processing of the one regulated substance: hydrofluoric acid, greater than 50% by weight (HF).  The facility follows the regulation and intent of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThis facility utilizes HF as an integral component of the manufacturing operations of inorganic compounds and refining of nonferrous metals.  Aqueous 70% HF is delivered to the facility in tank trucks.  Delivered Aqueous 70% HF is unloaded into one of three bulk HF storage tanks.  During delivery, HF trucks are flange-connected at the unloading fill station and compressed air is used to off-load the acid.  At all points during delivery, a qualified facility employee and qualified personnel from the supplier remain with the delivery truck.  From the bulk Aqueous 70% HF storage tanks, measured quantities of aqueous HF are pumped into process vessels in four buildings.  During the transfer of aqueous HF acid to the process vessels, aqueous HF is added to water and the concentration of HF solution immediately drops below 50% by weight and is no longer regulated by RMP.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, facilities that contain a regulated substance (such as HF) at quantities exceeding the RMP threshold must consider the impact of a worst-case and an alternate-case release of the substance.  We are aware of no changes from the 2008 OCA.  In 2008, GAM utilized the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as, the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance reference tables and equations to determine potential impacts.  Supporting data and calculations remain in place for the 20"

Pertinent PSM & RMP information is communicated to plant employees weekly to review plant safety, health and environmental issues.  General awareness HF training is given to all site employees.  Operators of HF systems and Contractor employees receive additional site-specific training.  Components of the HF systems are covered under a Mechanical Integrity program to assure that they operate safely and are physically sound.  Appropriate standard operating procedures (work instructions) are in place for start-up and shutdown of the processes, in both normal and emergency situations.  Information on the chemical, process technology, and equipment has been compiled. Changes to the process are reviewed under Management Of Change procedures.  Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to the implementation of any process change.  Contractors receive extensive safety training prior to beginning work in the facility.  Competence of the contractor employees is assured as part of the contractor selection program.  Hot work and other safe work permit programs are in place in the facility.  Process hazard analyses are conducted to identify potential hazards and areas for improvement.  Any incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and to identify changes to prevent recurrence.  The Risk Management Program is outlined and discussed in a PSM/RMP program document in use at the facility.\n\n\n\nGAM demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety by a continuing accident prevention program.  All incidents and near misses are investigated to identify root causes with corrective actions aimed to prevent future occurrences. In the event of an HF or other chemical release, GAM has in place an Emergency Response (ER) Plan, which is reviewed and updated whenever a significant change to a chemical system, including"

GAM maintains an onsite Emergency Response Team that responds to major chemical incidents.  The team is trained to administer first aid treatment following medically-approved HF protocols.  A member of the ERT would travel with an injured person to the hospital to ensure that the appropriate treatment is continued for HF acid exposure.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan establishes a written procedure to follow during a chemical release.  In the event of a major release, the plan calls for a facility evacuation and notification to the National Response Center, Berks County HazMat Team, local fire department, and PA DEP. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan also contains procedures to alert facility personnel of the danger potential; a list of emergency contacts; evacuation procedures and primary/secondary gathering locations; and the procedures to be implemented in the event of a fire at the facility. \n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, GAM has not experienced an accidental release that meets the criteria under the Risk Management Program regulations for inclusion on the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nIn summary, GAM is fully committed to the safe storage, use, and operation of the Aqueous HF systems utilized at the facility.  GAM is committed to continuously improving the overall safety, health and environmental performance record at the Boyertown facility.  Improvements are generally achieved through policies aimed at best management practices; site- and job-specific training; process and job hazard analyses; continued coordination with local emergency response agencies; and upholding the facility's goal to be an industry leader in workplace safety as well as a good steward of the environment."
