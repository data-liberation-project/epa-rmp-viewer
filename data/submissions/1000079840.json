The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 502 Central Ferry Road in Pomeroy, Washington (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a distributor of fertilizer.  There is one 25,000 gallon storage tank, three 30,000-gallon storage tanks, and six 30,000-gallon rail cars at the facility that are used for anhydrous ammonia storage.  The 25,000-gallon tank is operated in tandem with one 30,000-gallon tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is distributed to other Wilbur-Ellis facilities in the area and is also used for the on-site production of aqueous ammonia and for the production of ammonium polyphosphate.  \n\n\n\nThere are eight 36,000-gallon aqueous ammonia storage tanks located at this facility.  The aqueous ammonia storage tanks are filled to a maximum capacity of 34,000 gallons.  The aqueous ammonia has a concentration of 20 percent and is distributed to other Wilbur-Ellis facilities i"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Whitman County Fire Department #8 (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n"

The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1. Revise the Mechanical Integrity Procedures to specify RAGAGEP for pressure vessel inspection. \n\n2. Evaluate the capability of the existing bulkhead to withstand a pull-away, strengthen the existing bulkhead, or modify the liquid and vapor plumbing to include breakaway protection at the bulkhead.\n\n3. Include the vapor ESO installed at the tanker truck load-in bulkhead as part of the remote emergency shutdown system. \n\n4. Develop a plan to mitigate the restriction between the 2\" and 1.5\" vapor process piping associated with CMP1 and CMP2. \n\n5. Investigate, document, and adjust (if necessary) the differential pressure setting of the bypass valve shared by PMP-A1 and PMP-A2. \n\n6. Review/revise Operating Procedures to include inspection of HRV ball valves for open position. \n\n7. Update Operating Procedures to include a section that addresses safety systems and their functions. \n\n8. install an ammonia meter in the process area to investigate whether or not ammonia emissions are significant enough to exceed Washington State regulations; requiring use of a respirator or emissions control. 9. Install ESP's on liquid lines at converters. \n\n10. Install BPVC at vapor/tank connections hwere vapor from the converters is returned to the PV's. \n\n11. Install a pressure gauge in the discharge piping from PMP-PMPA3 and PMPA4. \n\n12. Install emergency shut-off valve on the ammonia piping that feeds the aqua ammonia process, tie emergency shut-off activation to the emergency shut-off at the ammonia pumps. \n\n\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a"
