              "Description": "The Dibrom process has been designed to prevent the release of bromine. The bromine storage tank is  located within a concrete dike for containment. The storage tank is equipped with a high level alarm and reductant shut-down systems to ensure that the level is maintained below maximum volume.  The process is continually monitored and bromine monitors are located within the process and around the perimeter to detect and provide an early warning for bromine vapors.  The presence will set off an audible alarm. A smaller bromine storage tank was put into service January 2011 and the RMP was updated for this reason. ",

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan has been prepared for the AMVAC pesticide manufacturing facility located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The plan has been prepared in accordance with section 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials (AHMs).  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by the AMVAC Chemical Corporation, Axis Plant, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP regulation and the relevent portions of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management regulations.\n\n\n\nThe AMVAC Axis facility was originally a portion of the Dupont Mobile Manufacturing Center.  It was purchased from Dupont by AMVAC on 5-18-2001.  The necessary documentation for the facility to comply with the RMP legislation was a part of that purchase agreement.  All of the Hazard and Operability Studies and Process Hazard Analysies were originally documented by Dupont and they have all been reviewed AMVAC in preparation of this RMP.  The AMVAC Axis plant and the Dupont MMC are on a common site.  All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency teams from both companies.\n\n\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\n\n1.  Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\n\n2.  Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\n\n3.  Operating in a manner which meets or exceeds existing laws and regulations and reflects a high level of concern and respect for the local community.\n\n4.  Investing in its future through aggressive research and development of new products and markets.\n\n5.

To achieve this we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\n\n\n\n2.0  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural pesticides at its plant located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the Dupont facility located on the common site.  The facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations, peripheral tanks and various ancilliary equipment.\n\nThe AMVAC Axis plant has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing.  The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nAs per 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4) the RMP must be updated no later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process above a threshold quantity. AMVAC plans to begin production of METAM/KPAM in Fall 2008 and two of the raw materials used in this process are covered chemicals. This updated RMP includes information to satisfy this requirement.

The criteria used to choose an alternative release scenario is an attempt to more closely define a serious release episode that could conceivably occur, but is still substantially more severe than expected with the safety and monitoring equiment in use.  These scenarios include the following:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario for covered Toxic Substances:\n\n\n\nPhosphorus trichloride has been considered as a toxic substance considered for this scenario.
