The management and employees of the Medford facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Chlorine or Silane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, purification, and distribution of Electronic Gases. There are two covered PSM/RMP process. One of the processes is Chlorine storage, purification and filling. The other process is Silane storage and filling. \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release (Silane) and the worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release (Chlorine), was used. The alternative release, or more probable, scenarios which was determined involved the release the flammable gas (silane) and one for the toxic gas release (Chlorine) were also base on EPA criteria.  Both can be reviewed by contacting the Linde facility.\n\nThe impacted area for both were determined using the 2000 US Census data obtained from \"Land View V\".  No environmental receptors are affected.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Chlorine and/or Silane.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n  \nWritten process safety information was developed"

The PHAs focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA re-validation for the Chlorine Process was completed on June 29, 2005 and the PHA for the Silane Process was completed on September 16, 2005.  Each will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in October 2007 for the Chlorine Process and Silane.  Each are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHAA?s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.

The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractor safety procedures were last review in October 2007.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters.
