      "SummaryText": "(a) Who - Winneshiek Cooperative Association (WCA) is an organization owned by crop growers and\n     livestock producers in NE Iowa and SE Minnesota.  The member-owners of WCA benefit from having \n     strategically located fertilizer, feed and grain facilities in Winneshiek and Howard (Iowa) counties.\n\n     Being owned by farmers, WCA does everything it can to protect and preserve the environment.  The \n     members, management and employees of WCA are committed to the prevention of any accidental \n     releases of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) or any other hazardous material.  In the event an accidental \n     release occurs, the Ridgeway facility is well prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \n     authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the relaease to people and the \n     environment.\n\n     All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prevention programs are strictly \n     adhered to.  The WCA Emergency Response Policy involves the preparation of response plans which \n     are tailored ot each facility and to the emergency response capabilities of the community they're located \n     in.\n\n(b) What and Where - The Ridgeway branch of WCA handles Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) as one of the \n     most economical sources of nitrogen fertilizer for corn.  The Ridgeway location serves corn growers \n     from NE Iowa.  The Ridgeway branch includes the NH3 plant, a dry fertilizer plant, liquid fertilizer tanks, \n     grain storage and a bagged feed, seed and crop protection product warehouse.  The NH3 is stored in a \n     30,000 gallon bulk tank.  The tank, with a maximum capacity of 131,000 pounds of NH3, is mounted on \n     two cement pillars.  There may also be nurse tanks and sidedress applicators belonging to this location which will contain anhydrous ammonia.  This increases the maximum capacity by an additional 129,000 pounds.  The entire NH3 handling process includes the latest safety products, with many of"

      "SummaryText": "eases - WCA's accidental raelease prevention program is based upon \n     provisions within Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, \n     published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and \n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  In addition to these requirements, WCA has also included the \n     following elements:\n\n     1.  Strictly limiting the number of staff who are allowed to handle NH3  \n     2.  Annual, thorough, strict safety and handling training of all people involved NH3\n     3.  All valve handles, controls and electrical switches are secured and/or locked to prevent \n          unauthorized releases and/or the overfilling of the main bulk tank.\n     4.  All pipelines have redundant as well as triple redundant valves and locking for security and safety.  \n     5.  Strict enforcement of all parts replacement policies mandated by state and federal officials.\n     6.  Rigorous inspection of each portable NH3 tank during loading.\n     7.  Thorough inspections of all NH3 application equipment before spring application season, after fall \n          application season and before being transported betwen farmers.\n\n(e)  No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n(f)  Emergency Response Program - Safety improvements at WCA are an on-going process.  WCA has an \n      extensive emergency action program, which it coordinates with the Winneshiek County Local \n      Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire departments.  This program includes an emergency \n      action decision chart, emergency phone number list, notification plans, maps and diagrams.\n\n     WCA last contacted the Winneshiek County Local Emergency Administrator on 9/19/2001.  It was      \n     determined that the current local emergency response plan does not contain reference to WCA, but \n     does reference a Farmer Service Company which it has been deter"

All of the NH3 equipment is inspected annually by State officials.  Much of the non-durable equipment (including hoses, safety valves) are replaced on a regular basis most of the time long before required to be replaced by other state and federal standards.  The Ridgeway branch is manned with staff on site five days a week.\n\n(c)  Worst case and alternate accidental release scenarios - The offsite consequence analysis includes \n     two accidental release theories, found as worst case release and alternative release scenario.The \n     worst case scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the \n     ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an \n     unspecified failure.  This accidental release is very unlikely to occur.  However, should it occur, \n     131,000 pounds of NH3 would be released, with a toxic end point (0.14 mg/L) reached at 3.8 miles \n     down wind from the facility.\n\n     The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  With \n     no accident history experience to base on, it is WCA's presumption the most likely to occur would be \n     the rupture of a transfer hose or pipe, tied with the failure of the involved excess flow valve.  The toxic \n     end point (0.14 mg/L) would reach 0.6 miles down wind from the facility.\n\n     WCA used RMP Comp to calculate the toxic endpoint selected by the EPA of .14 mg/L.  The public \n     population within the toxic endpoint distance of the Ridgeway facility is defined as the population \n     potentially affected by a worst case toxic release.\n\n     Because NH3 is not sotred within a building, no passive mitigation measures can be credited to slow or \n     reduce any release.\n\n(d)  How to prevent accidental rel"
