(UPI) is very concerned with the safety of its workers and individuals living and working near the facility.  UPI has therefore implemented a number of measures to insure that UPI maintains its safe working environment.  These measure include:\r\n- Detailed and comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all major operations at the facility.  These SOPs include elements to prevent accidents from occurring and response steps to take if accidents do occur.\r\n- Comprehensive training and testing for all employees.  All manufacturing employees must successfully pass written, oral, and demonstration tests prior to their working with hazardous substances and around hazardous equipment.\r\n- Establishment of detailed materials handling procedures.\r\n- Safe-work policies posted for all employees to review on a continual basis. \r\n- Work safety practices that include requirements for hot work permits, confined space permits, and lockout and tagging of equipment during maintenance.\r\n\r\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n1.2.1 Description of Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe UPI facility performs custom manufa"

      "SummaryText": "cturing of waterproofing compounds (NAICS code 32551).  The facility is located at 10880 Poplar Avenue, Fontana, California.  Approximately 12 workers will be employed at the UPI facility.  UPI uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), and other materials to prepare the waterproofing compounds.  The TDI and IPDI are stored in 55-gallon drums.  \r\n\r\nIn Fontana, the Administrating Agency (AA) for an RMP and a CalARP plan is the San Bernardino County Fire Department (SBCFD).  \r\n\r\nBoth the RMP and CalARP programs have defined specific threshold quantities (TQs) for hazardous chemicals covered under the programs.  If a given process uses an amount of the regulated substance greater than the TQ, the regulated substance is subject to the requirements of the program.  TDI is regulated under RMP and CalARP regulations.  IPDI is only regulated under the CalARP regulations.  For TDI, the RMP TQ is 10,000 pounds and the CalARP TQ is 500 pounds for the 2,4- isomer and 100 pounds for the 2,6- isomer.  The CalARP TQ for IPDI is 100 pounds.  Neither of these chemicals is regulated by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\r\n\r\nThe UPI facility stores the drums of TDI and IPDI in a segregated storage area.  Both the RMP and CalARP regulations define the storage of separate drums in a common storage area as a single process.  The facility is planning to store up to 80x55-gallon drums of TDI on-site at one time and up to 40x55-gallon drums of IPDI on-site at one time.  Therefore, the maximum inventory consists of approximately 44,000 pounds of TDI and 18,000 pounds of IPDI.  The maximum TDI content at UPI is above the RMP TQ and is also above the CalARP TQ.  The maximum IPDI content at UPI is above the CalARP TQ.  Therefore, UPI is subject to both the California CalARP program and to the Federal RMP program.\r\n\r\nThe major hazards represented by the process are the release of toxic substances (TDI and IP"

Transportation or storage accidents involving these chemicals are the scenarios that would produce the largest spill and potential release of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n1.2.2 Description of the Process\r\n\r\nThe raw materials are received at the UPI loading dock via trucks in 55-gallon drums.   Up to 72 drums of TDI may be received at one time, and up to 40 drums of IPDI may be received at one time.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored on-site is 80 drums and the maximum quantity of IPDI stored on-site is 40 drums.  \r\n\r\nThe TDI and IPDI are transferred from the loading dock area via forklift to a dedicated storage room, where they are stored until needed in the reactor room.  At that time, they are transferred by forklift to the reactor room.  The material is manually transferred by a slight vacuum into the mix chamber.  When the specified quantity of TDI and/or IPDI has been transferred, the flow is stopped.  The remaining required ingredients (including polyols, colorants, fillers, curing modifiers, and thinners) are added and the product is blended.  After blending is complete, the finished product is removed and placed into containers for storage and future shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIndividual components of the Accidental Release Prevention Program at the UPI facility include the following:\r\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been created for all major operations at the facility.  These SOPs include elements to prevent accidents from occurring and response steps to take if accidents do occur.\r\n- Comprehensive training and testing is required for employees.  All manufacturing employees must successfully pass written, oral, and demonstration tests prior to their working with hazardous substances and around hazardous equipment.\r\n- Detailed materials handling procedures are in-place for all resins, including those containing formaldehyde"

The emergency response plan has been submitted to the San Bernardino County Fire Department (SBCFD).\r\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been created for all major operations at the facility.  These SOPs detail the response steps to take if upset conditions do occur.\r\n- The local emergency response agencies (SBCFD, local police department) have been contacted to communicate the potential hazards at the facility and the expected response measures that will be taken in the event of an emergency.\r\n- Comprehensive training and testing is required for employees.  All manufacturing employees must successfully pass written, oral, and demonstration tests prior to their working with hazardous substances and around hazardous equipment.\r\n- Detailed materials handling procedures are in-place for all materials, including TDI and IPDI.\r\n- Creation and deployment of spill kits throughout the work area to allow rapid containment and minimization of area affected by the spill.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility is a new facility so there are no planned changes at this time to improve safety.  However, the facility operations will be reviewed if the emergency response program is activated to determine if there are operational procedures or physical improvements that can be made"
