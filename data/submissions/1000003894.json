Goal Line LP is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Goal Line LP staff are highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant and for controlling NOx emissions. \n\nThe Goal Line LP facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration and Ammonia Injection Systems. Goal Line LPA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe facilityA?s charge of aqueous ammonia is 41,400 lbs.  Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lbs threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Goal Line LP is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 30% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%. For the reasons mentioned above, the Ammonia Injection System is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and EPA RMP Program Level 2.\n\nThe Absorption Refrigeration UnitA?s charge of anhydrous ammonia is 5,160 lbs.  The regulated substance is over the 500 lb threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program but under the E"

Therefore, the Absorption Refrigeration Unit is only subject to CalARP Program Level 2.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Goal Line LP facility is located at 555 Tulip Street, Escondido, California. The facility is a combined cycle cogeneration facility that provides 50mW of energy and capacity to the local utility and employs 10 people at this location. The plant produces electrical power and supplies steam for operation of the ice arena.  The remaining electrical power, after satisfying the facility auxiliary energy needs, is sold to San Diego Gas and Electric Company (SDG&E).\n\nThe regulated substances in use are: anhydrous ammonia for the Ammonia Absorption \nRefrigeration Unit and 30% aqueous ammonia for both the Ammonia Injection System and the Ammonia Absorption System.\n\nThe maximum inventory and storage for the regulated substances are contained in the following vessels:\nA?    Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank (T-1902-1) A? 41,400lbs\nA?    Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Receiver (V-1804-14) A? 5,160 lbs\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nAmmonia Injection System A? 30% Aqueous Ammonia\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item in a ten (10) minute period.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of aqueous ammonia as a result of a rupture of a transfer hose used to fill aqueous ammonia to the SCR Ammonia Storage Tank. \n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Goal Line LP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case t"

      "SummaryText": "ype of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\nA?    Although, the facility is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM, the facility prevention program meets and exceeds the PSM requirements.\nA?    Ammonia sensors are located in the process area.\nA?    Automatic/Manual shutdowns in place.\nA?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\nA?    The history of the Goal Line LP facility (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration and Selective Catalytic Reduction Units. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, even though the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Unit and The Ammonia Injection System for Selective Catalytic Reduction are only subject to Prevention Program 2 requirements, Prevention Program 3 elements were implemented by Goal Line LP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for the NOx abatement, as well as for the refrigeration system. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n"
