      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW:\nThe Empire Electric District Company (Empire) owns & operates a coal-fired power plant located in the northwest part of Jasper County, Missouri near Asbury.  The Asbury facility has added a Selective Catalytic Reduction System (SCR) for air pollution control to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.  The SCR system requires the addition of two (2) 25,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks that will make the facility subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP).  It is Empire's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local environmental rules and regulations.  Each of the ammonia storage tanks is designed to be filled by tanker truck and will be serviced from a dedicated contract supplier.  Safety has been incorporated in all aspects of the SCR system and is inherent in the design and operation of the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:\nThe Asbury Plant Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is written in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulation 29 CFR 1910.38.  The purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of our employees; visitors to the facility; and, the local community.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities and has been coordinated with the Carl Junction, Missouri Fire Department.  A walk-through of the plant is conducted every year with the responsible Fire Department.  Ammonia hazard awareness training is provided to all employees.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\nEmpire has a prevention program in place that meets the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Employees have been trained of the procedures associated with the processes and the ERP.  Comprehensive process hazard assessments were performed using a Hazard Operability Analysis (HAZOP).  The ammonia tanks are equipped with a water sprinkler system that is activated automatically with the release of"
