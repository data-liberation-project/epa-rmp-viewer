      "SummaryText": "The Sheldon United Terminal Facility is located in Fairfield, California, approximately 9 miles east of Travis Air Force Base. \n\n\n\nSheldon United Terminal has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785).  The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all regulated substances and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility's staff is trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using the flammable substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nPropane is the regulated substance at Sheldon United Terminal and it is received, stored, and distributed from the Sheldon United Terminal Facility as a fuel source.  This regulated substance is stored in 90,000 gallon, 60,000 gallon and 30,000 gallon storage tanks at the Sheldon United Terminal facility.  The maximum intended inventory for the facility is 2,670,570 lbs. of propane.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\n\n\nSheldon United Terminal has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Propane Storage and Transfer System.  Sheldon United Terminal's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the regulated flammable substance.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the RMP/PSM/CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the facility.  All meteorological conditions are consistent with regulatory requirements and were input into RMP*Comp to generate the distance to the end"

The distance to endpoint is used to generate a radius of concern for the worst case release, which is then input into MARPLOT, which uses 2010 census data to estimate the population within the vulnerability zone.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the RMP/PSM/CalARP Regulations, one alternative release scenario has been defined for the facility.  The alternative release case considered the most likely cause of release at the facility based on knowledge of industry events and facility operating experience/history.  All meteorological conditions are consistent with regulatory requirements and were input into RMP*Comp to generate the distance to the endpoint. The distance to endpoint is used to generate a radius of concern for the alternative case release, which is then input into MARPLOT, which uses 2010 census data to estimate the population within the vulnerability zone.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and transfer of the regulated flammable substance has inherent potential risks, Sheldon United Terminal has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case scenario non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case scenario non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release. These characteristics are described below: \n\n?    Systems are in place to keep the quantity of each regulated substance to a minimum in each covered process.\n\n?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n?    The system undergoe"

A well designed relief system.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this RMP/PSM/CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Sheldon United Terminal to manage process safety issues associated with the use of the flammable substance, propane.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being followed.\n\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements applied to the propane process include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nOperating Procedures (OP)\n\nTraining (TRN)\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\nCompliance Audits (CA)\n\nIncident Investigation (II)\n\nEmployee Participation (EP)\n\nHot Work Permit (HWP)\n\nContractors (CON)\n\nEmergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have not been any reportable accidents in the past 5 years. If a release were to occur, the Fairfield Fire Department, Suisun Fire District and Solano County Sheriff's Office Dispatch would be contacted for support and would respond to mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSheldon United Terminal has implemented an Emergency Action Plan and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency. Sheldon United Terminal has filed a Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan via the California Environmental Reporting System (CERS) and this plan includes:\n\n?    Internal Response\n\n?
