Geocycle has prepared this plan and submitted a predictive RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.   This summary that includes a brief description of the key elements of our Level 2 program:\r\n\r\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\r\n\r\nGeocycle's prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Level 2 Prevention Program.  Key Polices which are implemented include:\r\n1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A) (1)\r\n\r\nGeocycle has a management system that   is led by the Facility Manager and supporting staff.  This is depicted in an organization chart.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2 (A) (2)\r\nGeocycle maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of our prevention program.  It also includes all requirements for a RCRA hazardous waste facility.\r\n\r\n1.3.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT GEOCYCLE, HOLLY HILL, SC SITE   (B)\r\nThe Geocycle Plant employs 20 full-time employees engaged in HWDF plant. \r\n\r\n2.\tSITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\r\nThe site is owned by Holcim (US) and is managed and operated by Geocycle.  The site is located at 2175 Gardner Blvd, Holly Hill, SC, Orangeburg County.\r\n\r\n3.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (B) (2)\r\nHWDFs include both a flammable mixture and toxic chemicals.\r\nProcess 1, Tank Farm/Blend Tank System, covers a flammable mixture and 12 toxic chemicals.  In past submittal the chemicals in the flammable mixture were listed as individual flammable chemicals.  Now all of the flammables are listed as constituents of the mixture.\r\nProcess 2, Direct Burn System, includes nine toxic as well as each Process number 1, flammable mixture and 12 toxic chemicals \r\n\r\n3.1"

All results are maintained on site and included in the RMP Submit program.  \r\n3.1.1.\tWorst Case (c) (1)\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed for each flammable and toxic chemical using the EPA's RMP-COMP program.  \r\n3.1.2.\tAlternative Case (c) (2)\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 100-gallon-per-minute leak in a tank, pump, pipe or associated storage and transfer equipment.  Modeling was performed using the EPA's RMP COMP program based on duration of 60 minutes, which is a conservative assumption.\r\n\r\n4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE LEVEL 2 PREVENTION PROGRAM (C)\r\nThe Geocycle accidental release prevention program is based on EPA's RMP Level 2 prevention program.  Also, Geocycle HWDF policies and procedures meets RCRA requirements for a permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility and MSHA safety standards therefore the plant is exempt from OSHA standards.  \r\n\r\n4.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (C) (1)\r\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written program's elements is listed below:\r\n4.1.1.\tProcess safety information for chemicals and equipment.  Note all chemicals are waste streams and thus a list of chemicals within a waste stream is certified by the waste supplier.  Geocycle also uses the SDSs for the pure constituents as a guide to the hazards presented.\r\n4.1.2.\tA hazards review policy and reports.\r\n4.1.3.\tOperating procedures are developed and implemented. \r\n4.1.4.\tTraining program is established in each area for subject employees and contractors.  \r\n4.1.5.\tMaintenance and preventive maintenance is conducted and documented.\r\n4.1.6.\tGeocycle's compliance audits policy is followed.

The safety information assists in the understanding of the safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, and the limitations placed on the operations and the adopted codes and standards.  First, Geocycle receives hazardous waste, and uses a detailed chemical analysis and physical property analysis to define each waste stream.  There are no MSDS or SDSs for hazardous waste.  However, a SDS of the individual components is used as a guide.  Next, the bulk containers used for delivering the waste fuel containing the RMP compounds are DOT-specification containers and are required to be tested periodically for tightness and adequacy for carrying hazardous materials.  Documentation of the safety and design information on the typical process equipment, along with the corresponding design codes, is maintained in the plant's current RCRA Permit Application in Section4 - Storage and Process Information (4.3 Hazardous Waste Management), Operations SOPs for Operating Limits and Temporary Operations, Engineering and Maintenance Records.  The 2011/2012 EPD audit report and equipment evaluation confirmed all of the equipment installations were within code.  The information contained on the Safety Information Sheet is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis for completeness and accuracy.
