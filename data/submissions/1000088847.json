Tipton facility, the only Federally regulated RMP-covered process(<10k lbs.)is the Ammonia Refrigeration System. However in California having a lower threshold (<500 lbs.) this includes the Co-generation SCR Nox reduction process.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Dairies uses the ammonia refrigeration system (Process 1) to chill, produce and hold product. The ammonia system utilized by California Dairies includes a liquid ammonia receiver. High-pressure liquid ammonia flows from the high-pressure receiver to the pump recirculator and then to the evaporators and silos where the pressure is reduced by allowing the ammonia to expand through expansion valves. The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia is evaporated to provide refrigeration. Ammonia vapor exiting the evaporators is returned to the engine room. The resultant dry vapor is drawn to the compressors where it is compressed. The compressed vapor is then condensed to a liquid by rejecting heat to air and water in the evaporative condensers and draining that warm liquid by gravity to the  to the high-pressure receiver. \r\n\r\nIn addition Califo"

Their policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios were calculated for the covered process at the California Dairies facility and the written results of the off-site consequence scenarios are on file at the facility.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\n\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., in the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than in the model).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\r\n-There are process valves to pe"
