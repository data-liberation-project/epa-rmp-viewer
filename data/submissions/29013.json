(Polychemie) has reviewed and enhanced \r\npreviously existing accidental release procedures and emergency\r\nresponse policies.  These policies include:\r\n    *   an emergency response sequence\r\n    *   emergency response to fires, explosions, and environmental\r\n\treleases\r\n    *   notification and reporting to regulatory agencies in the \r\n\tevent of a reportable release\r\n    *   emergency response to hurricanes, floods, and bomb threats\r\n    *   spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plan\r\n    *   identification and training of an emergency response team\r\n    *   emergency coordinator and regulatory call lists\r\n    *   emergency equipment list and location\r\n    *   sensitive materials storage list\r\n    *   material profiles and material safety data sheets for major \r\n\traw materials on site. \r\n\r\nThere are five substances at the Polychemie facility that are regulated \r\nby the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR Part \r\n68.  These substances are used in various processes throughout the \r\nfacility to produce water treatment polymers.  Specifically, the facility\r\nproduces cationic polymers, polyamine, Mannich products, melamine \r\nformaldehyde acid colloid, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride \r\n(DADMAC), as well as other related products.  Substances that are used by\r\nPolychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable \r\nsubstances by 40 CFR Part 68 are as follows:\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:\r\n\r\n *   Aqueous Ammonia: 30 percent ammonium hydroxide (aqueous ammonia) is \r\n\tused as a reactant in the polyamine and other processes.  The \r\n\tmaximum amount of 30 percent ammonium hydroxide (aqueous ammonia)\r\n\tstored on-site is 110,000 pounds (33,000 pounds pure ammonia).\r\n\r\n *   Epichlorohydrin: Epichlor"

The maximum quantity stored \r\n\ton-site is 990,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n *   Ethylenediamine: Ethylenediamine is used as a reactant in the \r\n\tpolyamine and other processes. The maximum quantity stored \r\n\ton-site is 60,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n *   Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in the Mannich \r\n\tprocess,melamine formaldehyde acid colloid process, and in other \r\n\tprocesses.  Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent \r\n\tsolution in water.  The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde \r\n\tstored on-site is 55,000 pounds (20,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances:\r\n\r\n     Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is used in the DADMAC process as a \r\n\treactant. Dimethylamine is received and stored in anhydrous form.\r\n\tThe maximum amount of anhydrous dimethylamine stored on-site is \r\n\tapproximately 1,800,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenarios:\r\n\r\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and \r\nalternative release scenarios were evaluated and are discussed in this \r\nRMP.  As required, a worst case scenario is presented in the RMP for \r\none toxic substance and the one flammable substance.  Alternative \r\nscenarios were also prepared for each of the toxic substances and the \r\nflammable substance since the worst-case endpoints were located off \r\nsite.  The endpoint represents the distance at which the effects from \r\na released substance do not pose potential serious risk to the public.  \r\n\r\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the \r\nrelease of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or \r\nprocess line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified \r\nendpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the \r\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are \r\nnot considered.  The release is simply assumed to take place and the \r\ngreatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly released.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e results of the \r\nworst case scenario analysis were as follows:\r\n\r\n *   Toxic Substances: The aqueous ammonia storage tank was assumed to \r\n\tfail and subsequently produce an instantaneous release of the \r\n\tentire tank contents.  The release was assumed to evaporate over \r\n\ta 10-minute time period. The passive mitigation controls of the \r\n\ttank dike were considered in limiting the release impacts.  The \r\n\tdistance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be less than \r\n\t0.62 miles.\r\n\r\n     Flammable Substances: A dimethylamine storage tank was assumed to \r\n\tfail and subsequently produce an instantaneous release of the \r\n\tentire tank contents that results in a vapor cloud explosion.  \r\n\tNo passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the \r\n\trelease impacts. The distance to the explosion endpoint was \r\n\testimated to be less than 0.41 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in \r\nendpoints that affect public receptors.  For epichlorohydrin, \r\nethylenediamine, and formaldehyde, releases were assumed to occur as a \r\nresult of the uncoupling or rupture of a transfer hose during unloading \r\noperations for each substance. For dimethylamine, the alternative release \r\nscenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of the \r\nuncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. The \r\nalternative release scenario for these materials was assumed to occur over \r\na 1-minute time period. With the exception of considering that these \r\ntransfer operations are monitored by personnel at all times, no other \r\nmitigating controls were assumed to limit the release. For aqueous \r\nammonia, it was assumed that a release occurred due to a flange leak over \r\na 10 minute period. The results of the alternative release scenario \r\nanalysis were as follows:\r\n\r\n\tToxic Substances:\r\n                    Aqueous Ammonia - 0.19 miles \r\n                    Epichlorohydrin - 0.19 miles"

The ERP will \r\nbe coordinated with the local fire department.  As part of community \r\ninvolvement efforts, the facility's management has coordinated an \r\nemergency response drill with the local fire department, police \r\ndepartment, and ambulance service.\r\n\r\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history \r\nwas reviewed. Since start-up, no accidental releases \r\nfrom covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, \r\nor significant property damage on-site or off-site; or resulted in \r\noff-site evacuations or sheltering in place. \r\n\r\nSafety Improvement:\r\n\r\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned \r\nchanges and policies to promote this improvement include continuous \r\nreview and update of the facility's ERP, continued management of the \r\nplant Safety Work Order System, and yearly emergency drills with the \r\ncommunity to de"
