The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases. Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders. The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning. Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\n\n     A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impacts of worst-case and alternative accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances;\n\n     A prevention program that covers ope"

Oleum is the only CAA 112(r) RMP regulated substance, at this facility, above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA. \n\n\u00bfOleum\u00bf is the term used to describe fuming sulfuric acids. Oleum is made in various strengths and consists of sulfur trioxide dissolved in 100% sulfuric acid. Thus, 20% oleum contains 20% sulfur trioxide and 80% sulfuric acid by weight. Oleum is normally turbid and off-white in appearance. Depending on strength, the vapor pressure is such that sulfur trioxide escapes and combines with moisture in the air to form sulfuric acid mist particles that are visible and can create clouds of dense white mists. \n\nOleum, in a 20% concentration, is delivered by tank truck in less than 25,000 pounds (1,560  gallons) quantities and is transferred into a reactor vessel in the Additive Process. Additional compounds are added and a reaction occurs which removes the majority of the sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid. When the intermediate mixture is transferred into the next process vessel, 5-10% excess sulfur trioxide remains in the process until water is introduced to complete the reaction of the sulfur trioxide to dilute sulfuric acid.\n\nSulfur trioxide and oleums are strongly acidic materials that react rapidly with water to form sulfuric acid, evolving considerable heat. They rapidly dehydrate body tissues and may cause destruction of tissue from direct chemical reaction, by thermal burns, and/or by dehydration of the tissue.\n\nHuman health"

      "SummaryText": "effects of overexposure to oleum to the skin include skin burns or ulceration. Eye exposure may result with corneal or conjunctiva ulceration. Ingestion of the liquid may cause severe burns to the mucosal membranes of the mouth and esophagus. Repeated or prolonged exposure to the mists may cause eye irritation with discomfort, tearing, or blurring of vision. Skin exposure to the mists may result in skin irritation with discomfort or a rash. Overexposure by inhalation may cause upper respiratory irritation or erosion of dental enamel. Higher inhalation exposures may lead to temporary lung irritation with cough, discomfort, difficulty in breathing, or shortness of breath. Sometimes modest initial symptoms are followed hours later by severe shortness of breath requiring prompt medical attention or even by rapid loss of consciousness with serious lung tissue damage and pneumonitis.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not set exposure limits specifically for sulfur trioxide and/or oleum, but they have set limits for sulfuric acid mist exposure. OSHA has ruled that an employee\u00bfs exposure to sulfuric acid mist in any 8-hr work shift of a 40-hr work week shall not exceed a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1 mg/m3.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with requirements for hazardous materials use, and it is Forth Technologies\u00bf policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Forth Technologies\u00bf policy to notify the Jefferson County LEPC and respond to the emergency.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\n\nThe worst case scenario:  As required by EPA, the worst case scenario evaluates the failure of the 2,000 gallon oleum reactor when filled to the greatest amount administratively allowed (1,560  gallons), resulting in a dense vapor cloud.

The 3.6 mile radius includes an estimated residential population of 161,714 people, recreational areas, schools, hospitals, and industrial areas.\n\nFive-year accident history:  As the use of oleum in the Additive Process is a new process, the Forth Technologies has not had an accident in the past five years involving oleum.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The oleum system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable ANSI guidelines, engineering codes, manufacturer specifications, best management practices, and state law.  The Forth Technologies is required to comply with EPA RMP prevention programs.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the oleum system, the operator will close the main valves, shut down the system and evacuate the immediate area. The in-house Emergency Response Team (ERT) will initiate the use of containment, absorbents and neutralization equipment (if necessary). If any release is likely to impact off site, the local emergency services will be notified. Forth Technologies has an in-house response team whose members are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician level as defined by 29 CFR 1910.120. Forth Technologies employees are trained to use self-contained breathing equipment and have taken OSHA worker right-to-know training. Contract response teams are available to respond to releases beyond the capabilities or level of expertise of the in-house emergency response team."
