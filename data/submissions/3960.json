              "Description": "Northwest Indiana Water Company has taken the task of safeguarding its chlorination process very seriously. It has utilized numerous tools and procedures in an attempt to ensure that the risks associated with the usage of chlorine are kept to a minimum level.  Prevention measures which have been adopted and are being adhered to include the following:  1) Management System-designed to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the plan understands their responsibilities and that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements, 2) Process Safety Information- information which includes, but is not limited to, the hazards of chlorine, chlorine feed technology and chlorine feed process equipment, 3) Process Hazard Analysis- a \"what if?\" typeof questionairre that assesses the human error and error-likely situations in identifying causes and considering the range of human responses and abilities when dealing with the events that could initiate a chemical release incident, 4) Operating Procerdures- step-by-step operational guidelines that are available for all stages of the chlorination process system, 5) Training- a way of ensuring that personnel, working on or near the chlorine feed process, are adequately trained to understand the inherent process hazards and what appropriate response actions are necessary if responding to an accidental chlorine release, 6) Contractor Safety- evaluating potential and/or current chlorine process area contractors in order to ensure that only contractors with safe work histories and adequate safety and health programs are selected and retained, 7) Management of Change- procedure that ensures any chlorine process changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications, 8) Pre-Start-Up Safety Review- designed to be performed on new or modified chlorine processes to ensure that the facility is ready to safely operate within new established parameters, 9) Mechanical Integrity- a way to ensure that continued integrity of the chlorine process equipment is inherent and that mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment is negated, 10) Safe Work Practices- procedures in place, within the safety structure of the facility, that are designed to control hazards that may be encountered by employees and/or contractors while operating and maintaining the chlorine feed process, 11) Incident Investigation- procedure designed to formally identify the underlying causes of an incident and to implement corrective actions designed to prevent the incident from recurring, 12) Emergency Planning and Response- a way to ensure quick and effective facility response relative to emergency type situations, 13) Compliance Audits- comprehensive audits, performed by an \"outside\" concern, that evaluates Northwest Indiana Water Company's chlorine Process Safety and Risk Management compliance programming and implementation.",

The hazards associated with the chlorination process (chlorine is considered a hazardous chemical by both OSHA and the EPA) necessitate certain safety precautions associated with the storage, handling, and use of this chemical.  Precautions are taken to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employees, and ultimately to reduce the threat of exposure to the nearby members of the community.  Northwest Indiana Water Company's policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations relative to chlorine safety.  Included, within the framework of these statutes, are guidelines associated with: 1) management system, 2) process safety information, 3) process hazard analysis, 4) operating procedures, 5) training, 6) contractor safety, 7) management of change, 8) pre-start-up safety review, 9) mechanical integrity, 10) safe work practices, 11) incident investigation, 12) emergency planning and response, and 13) compliance audits.  Adherence to the aforementioned parameters, in addition to a combination of a) proper handling and usage, b) inherent safety designs of the equipment and process itself and c) sufficient training of all appropriate personnel will be utilized to achieve a goal of zero accidents and zero release exposure incidents."
