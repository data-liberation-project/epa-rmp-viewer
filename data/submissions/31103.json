Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Fairway Gas Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is the operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant for the production of Natural Gas Liquids.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include: Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane (Propane, 2-methyl-), Butane, Isopentane (Butane, 2-methyl-) and Pentane.  These regulated substances are components of the inlet gas, the NGL product and the residue natural gas.  The maximum inventory of the regulated substances at our facility is:\nMethane          11,000 lb\nEthane            41,000 lb\nPropane        240,000 lb\nIsobutane        28,000 lb\nButane           38,000 lb\nIsopentane      52,000 lb\nPentane          28,000 lb\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  The Fairway Gas Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  We also have an air operating permit unter Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.  \nProcess Safety Management\nThe Fairway Gas Plant maintains a detailed r"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If\" method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  These analyses are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \nOperating Procedures\nfor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Fairway Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nThe Fairway Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nthe Fairway Gas Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and flare systems, emergency shutdown systems, control systems and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and time"

The most recent review/revision of the management of change procedures was performed on May 13, 2004.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification.  They are also given training necessary to safely deal with the modification.\nPre-start up Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Fairway Gas Plant.  The most recent review was performed on May 13, 2004.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \nCompliance Audits\nThe Fairway Gas Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was completed December 16, 2002.  These audits are caried out at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation\nThe Fairway Gas Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\nEmployee Participation\nThe Fairway Gas Plant approaches process safety management and accident prevention on a team basis.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of PSM and RMP rules, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to provide specialized maintenance, construction, and other services.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Fairway Gas Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the associated plant processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures of emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Contractors participate in the Company's routine safety meetings.\n4.  Five-year accident history\nThe Fairway Gas Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  There has been no accidental release during the last five-year reporting period.\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\nThe Fairway Gas Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes phone numbers for notification of emergency responders and the local emergency response agencies.  We have also coordinated emergency response actions with the Poynor Fire Department.  This Plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes that have taken place.\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe developments and findings that result from implementing the various elements of our accidental release prevention program are routinely evaluated to determine whether any changes could be made to improve safety at our facility.  All of the significant changes that have been identified have been implemented."
