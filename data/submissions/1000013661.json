Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements for a Level 1 RMP Program.  \n\n\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur facility has one process that produces prepolymers which are used to make polyurethanes.  The regulated substance involved with this batch operation is toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers, CAS# 26471-62-5).  Toluene diisocyanate, mixed isomers, is 80% 2,4-TDI (CAS# 584-84-9) and 20% 2,6 TDI (CAS# 91-08-7).  Using ALOHA 5.4.1.2 in the off-site consequence analysis, it was found the 2,6-TDI isomer had the worst case off-site impact.  Therefore, the worst case scenario presented in this resubmission assumes 100% 2,6 TDI isomer.  The ALOHA dispersion model as shown on the attached graghic files indicate an endpoint radius of 56 yards, which is within the Cytec property boundary.\n\n\n\n( c ) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe regulation does not require program Level 1 processes to have an accidental release prevention program.  However, through compliance with the following internal requirements and other regulations, CYTEC OLEAN does have a comprehensive program.\n\n\n\n- Cytec Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\n\n- New York State \"Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan as defined in 6 New York Code of Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) Part 373-2.3 \"Preparedness and Prevention\" and Part 373-2.4 \"Contingency Plan.\"\n\n- Federal Environmental Protection Agency's \"Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Planni"

This plan is coordinated with local emergency response through the Cattaraugus County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Copies of the CSPER plan are provided to local fire and police departments, as well as privately contracted emergency responders as needed.  \n\n\n\nThe plan defines individual responsibilities and tasks during various emergencies.   CYTEC OLEAN provides training appropriate to the level of involvement to all employees.\n\n\n\nDuring emergencies involving spills, CYTEC OLEAN employees are asked to report the event, provide key information on the type and extent of the emergency, and follow the Emergency Coordinator's instructions to stabilize processes, control employee access to affected in plant areas, and control immediate access to the facility by visitors, contractors and off-shift employees.  The Emergency Coordinator, or backups, direct this first response, and make timely notifications to local responders and the Emergency Response Contractor.  When local emergency responders arrive, the Emergency Coordinator provides on-site assistance and support.  Spill Response, including all clean-up and remedial operations, is the responsibility of the Emergency Response Contractor.  The Plan defines notifications to Local, State and Federal Agencies, as well as the Public.\n\n\n\n(f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving"
