The Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of the facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee to respond to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Ammonia is stored in one (1) pressurized, steel storage tanks and multiple smaller nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3. The worst case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons. The alternate case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program: The facility complies with Iowa Administrative Code Part 21, Chapter 43, Rule 43.6(200) relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries or property damage or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:"

Information relevant to emergency planning, including off-site consequence analysis, is made available to the local fire department and local emergency planning committee for preparation of a community response plan.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvements are an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
