Bonanza Creek is committed to safety and environmental excellence. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them. As a company, Bonanza Creek follows a close adherence to applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about Bonanza Creek's operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, and 5 year accident history.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nBonanza Creek Energy Operating Company is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors and the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility. Bonanza Creek implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility has not had nor does it anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release. However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, Bonanza Creek personnel, in cooperation with local agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure which would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe State North Platte CPF facility 42-26 is located near Kersey, Colorado.

      "SummaryText": "tural gas central processing facility, designed to produce primarily crude oil and natural gas. A fuel conditioning skid is installed on the oil storage tank vapor and low pressure process gas systems which generates natural gas liquids (NGLs) separated from the gas and vapors. Additionally, vapor recover unit (VRU) compression for the oil tank vapor and low pressure process gas systems creates pressurized condensate as a by-product of gas compression. The facility consists of three-phase production separation, oil and water storage tanks, mechanical gas refrigeration, gas compression, pressurized liquids storage and loadout racks and meters, as well as all associated piping, valves, and pumps. The NGLs and pressurized condensate extracted from the fuel conditioning process include methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane natural gasoline mixtures delivered to market via transportation vehicles. The NGLs and pressurized condensate are the regulated substances handled in this facility. The facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation. There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario Process 1\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for Process 1 is a release of a flammable mixture resulting in a failure of a single 18,000-gallon NGL storage vessel releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact. The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the release scenario. The worst case release method for a flammable mixture, the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi, was used in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario Process 2\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for Process 2 is a release of a flammable mixture resulting in a failure of a single 1"

Additionally, personnel are trained in appropriate safe work practices which apply to the process and facility per corporate safety guidelines.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations consistent with industry practice and to meet regulatory requirements. Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and wellbeing of employees, contractors and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\nThe State North Platte CPF 42-26 facility has no history of releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in offsite effects.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nBonanza Creek has a written emergency response procedure to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including response to a regulated substance release including the possibility of a fire or explosion in the event a flammable substance is accidently released. Procedures incorporate evacuation routes and practice, methods for personnel headcounts, and company and agency notification.
