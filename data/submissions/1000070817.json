This process is defined and explained in the prevention program procedures.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\r\n\r\nIndividuals knowledgeable in refrigeration operation or the equipment being investigated lead formal incident investigations.  Root cause and corrective actions are determined and formal reports are prepared.  Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is tracked through final resolution.\r\n\r\nHarlan has not had an accidental release of ammonia within the past five years that resulted in an onsite injury or adversely affected the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency response Program\r\n\r\nHarlan's emergency action plan has been designed to address likely incidents arising from our ammonia refrigeration system.

Harlan continues to plan for the unplanned ammonia release while striving to adhere to the latest mechanical integrity and inherently safer technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned improvements to reduce risk\r\n\r\nIn accordance with its risk management program, Harlan conducts continuous self-examination evaluations designed to identify and assess process/operational risk employees and the community.

This is known as employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved efficiencies at the plant.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Harlan coordinates emergency response activities and training with the local emergency management organizations.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents.\r\n\r\nFacility description and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nHarlan Bakeries is a domestic producer of processed food products.  The Harlan Bakeries Avon, Indiana plant site covers approximately 216,768 square feet within the Avon, Indiana city limits.

The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to workers as well as the surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nIt is Harlan's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of ammonia is paramount at Harlan.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of ammonia are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, and failsafe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements being studied.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which ammonia refrigerant is handled, the safety devices inherent to the refrigeration system design, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of Harlan workers.\r\n\r\nHarlan believes that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in Harlan organization structure and employee empowerment.  \r\n\r\nExtensive improvements have been made to safety and health programs like the prevention program (process safety and risk management), emergency preparedness and response, and training.\r\n\r\nAdditionall"
