The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds,\n        which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst case scenario is 2.5 miles.\n\n       The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a \n       break in a transfer hose.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has\n       the possiblity of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4)   The accidental release prevention program.\n\n       This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule  and with all applicable state \n       codes and regula"
