The accidental release prevention and emergency response associated specifically with the plant's use of EDA involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe PQ Kansas City Plant is located on 19 acres.  The site includes one office building, several manufacturing buildings, a maintenance shop, and a laboratory building.  There are approximately 75 PQ employees at the site. \n\nThe PQ Kansas City Plant operates 24 hours per day and manufactures sodium silicate, silica gel, and zeolite.  \n\nEthylenediamine (EDA) is regulated by the RMP rule.  It is used as a process chemical in manufacturing different grades of zeolite.  It is a combustible, colorless liquid with ammonia-like smell.  It is received by tank truck and stored in a 4000-gallon storage tank surrounded by a diked secondary containment system.  \n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the PQ Kansas City Plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.  Also described within each of these elements are associated chemical-specific prevention steps, where applicable.\n\n3a.

The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of the regulated chemicals (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of exceedence), and data on the equipment used in the process (e.g., Piping & Instrument Diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems).  The process safety information is adequate to show compliance of the process design with generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n3b. Process Hazard Analyses\n\nProcess hazard analyses for the processes involving Ethylenediamine have been completed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) (OSHA Process Safety Management).  These process hazard analyses are updated and revalidated in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e), and are retained on site for the life of the process.\n\nIn general, one or more of the following methodologies are used to complete each process hazard analysis: (a) what-if evaluation; (b) checklist; (c) hazard and operability study (HAZOP); (d) failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA); (e) fault tree; (f) process mapping; and (g) cause and effect matrix.  Each process hazard analysis addresses the process hazards, process incident history, process control devices and detection systems, evaluation of failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors.  Each process hazard analysis is performed by a team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis.

Records of the compliance audit reports are maintained to document the results of the audits and corrective actions taken, if necessary.\n\n3i. Incident Investigation\n\nAll incidents, which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a release of Ethylenediamine are investigated promptly.  The incident investigation starts with the selection of an Incident Investigation Team.  The incident investigation team is made up of employees having experience and knowledge of the processes affected by the incident, and knowledge of completing incident investigations.  Following the incident investigation, a report is prepared to include the following information: (a) date, time, and location of the incident; (b) employees involved in the incident, and their roles; (c) date of the incident investigation; (d) names of employees on the incident investigation team; (e) description of the incident, including a chronology of events; (f) root causes and contributing causes, including conditions at the time of the incident, and; (g) recommendations to prevent a recurrence.  Follow-up actions which are taken as a result of the recommendations in the incident investigation report are documented.\n\n3j. Employee Participation\n\nAll employees at the PQ Kansas City Plant have opportunities to access and participate in the sharing of information related to process safety for the processes involving Ethylenediamine.  Each employee has access to operating procedures.  A safety audit card program is established to allow any employee to note observations, either positive or negative, and submit the card to the health, safety and environmental department to reinforce positive observations or to require corrective actions to mitigate negative observations.  All employees can communicate concerns about safety by submitting a near miss report or safety work order.  Employees also attend bi-weekly process safety meetings where periodi"

Employees routinely have opportunities to participate in other safety processes under the prevention program such as process hazard analyses, management of change, employee training, and incident investigations.\n\n3k. Hot Work Permits\n\nThe PQ Kansas City Plant has established a hot work permit system.  The hot work permit system applies to processes involving Ethylenediamine.  Under the system, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations.  Hot work operations may include burning, welding, or torch cutting.  The hot work permit indicates the type and method of hot work to be conducted, the equipment the hot work will be performed on, the date, time, and location authorized for the hot work, the presence of fire prevention and protection systems meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and signatures of the supervisory employees authorizing the hot work.  A separate hot work permit must be issued for each hot work operation, and a separate hot work permit must be issued for each day.  A copy of the hot work permit must be displayed at the job location while hot work is in progress, and the permit is maintained on file after the completion of the hot work.\n\n3l. Contractors\n\nPrior to retaining contractor services for work in the process areas involving Ethylenediamine, contractor's safety performance and program is evaluated.  This includes a review of the contractor's Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), review of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses, review of Lost Work Day Cases Away (LWDCA), review of the contractor's safety program including safety policies and training, and review of any applicable site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) prepared by the contractor.  The information supplied by the contractor is retained while the contractor is engaged in work activities.\n\nPrior to commencing work on site, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation pr"

The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the site emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of site safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the site, including the date the training was completed.  Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site.  Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dismissal from the site.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past 5 years, there was one accidental release of Ethylenediamine that resulted in an OSHA Recordable injury.  A PQ employee was splashed with a small amount of Ethylenediamine while attempting to pump Ethylenediamine from the storage tank to a process vessel.  Extreme cold weather caused a small section of the Ethylenediamine line to freeze.  The corrective actions included installing additional heat tracing for the Ethylenediamine line, as well as modifications to the system valves to allow for remote operation, rather than manual operation.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe PQ Kansas City Plant has an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The program includes a written Emergency Response Plan and employee training in emergency response procedures. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for emerge"
