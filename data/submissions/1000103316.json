The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: Public and emergency response agency notification procedures; \u00bfh Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \u00bfh Emergency response measures; \u00bfh Procedures  for  inspecting, testing, and  maintaining emergency response equipment; \u00bfh Employee training; and \u00bfh Program review procedures. EnLink maintains a corporate Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at all EnLink facilities, including the Riverside Plant, as well as additional safety information. The Riverside Plant also maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Geismar Fire Department.  For these reasons, the Riverside Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b), and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95. \n \nA site map, SDSs, and a list of che"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture above 1 percent include ethane, methane, propane, isobutane, Nbutane, isopentane, and pentane.   Riverside Natural Gas Liquids Fractionation Facility (the Plant) separates mixed natural gas liquids (NGLs) into commercial products such as propane, isobutane, normal butane and gasoline (C5+).
