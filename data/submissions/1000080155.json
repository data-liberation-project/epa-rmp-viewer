Employees at all levels are accountable for assuring high standards of environmental, health and safety compliance and performance. Safety, health and protection of the environment will be maintained as integral aspects of all business activities.\n\n\n\nThe Bedford Heights Plant packages aerosol products including paint, lubricants, adhesives, cleaners, disinfectants and air fresheners. Propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether (i.e., propellants) are the RMP flammable substances used in the packaging of aerosols, and are stored on-site in excess of the threshold quantity.  There are no listed toxic substances handled at this site in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is a hypothetical release of any of the hazardous materials listed under the RMP rule as determined by the USEPA. The EPA mandates that companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance.  Only passive safety controls, such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate, can be considered.  An example of a passive safety control is storage of a limited quantity (e.g., 85 percent maximum fill) in bulk storage tanks.  The worst case scenario presumes none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems requiring energy or human intervention are operational. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined by EPA to be a vapor cloud explosion.  The results were modeled using an EPA model, RMP*Comp.  This scenario assumes that the total quantity of the flammable substance in the site's largest storage vessel is released into a vapor cloud, which then explodes.  The endpoint for the impact zone was determined by EPA to be an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch (psi) from the explosion"

The release scenarios evaluated show the potential for an offsite consequence.\n\n\n\nThe following safety prevention and emergency response steps are in place to reduce the likelihood of any effect on the community in the event of a release: operator training and certification programs; technical staff training and support; process hazard analysis; mechanical work plan analysis; equipment integrity standards; mechanical integrity inspections; management of change; safety audits; emergency shutdown systems; emergency procedures; and accident investigations. \n\n\n\nThere has not been an accident or incident that has met the RMP criteria involving propane, butane, isobutane or methyl ether at the Bedford Heights plant during the last five years.  Criteria for RMP reporting are accidents that have resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  The plant in its history has never had a release that caused off-site injury. \n\n\n\nThe site has made arrangements for assistance from the local fire department and other emergency responders as well as third party contractors to respond to emergency incidents.\n\n\n\nThe site continually reviews, and if necessary improves, the safety programs and systems at the facility."
