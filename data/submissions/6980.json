      "SummaryText": "As good neighbors Farmer's Grain & Supply is committed to keeping the community safe.  We comply with\nall Federal and State standards regarding anhydrous ammonia storage.\nThe Farmer's Grain facility located at 8111 12th place, Somers, WI, complies with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  Farmer's Grain's emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and police department, as well as the Kenosha Emergency Service.  The telephone numbers for the previously named public services are posted on an emergency board in plain sight in case of an emergency.\nAt the facility located in Somers, WI, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers.  The anhydrous is received by rail car or truck and stored in an 18,000 gallon tank.  It is distributed for direct application.  The maximum amount stored at this facility is 78,000 pounds (18,000 gallons times 5.1 pounds per gallon times 85%).\nWorst case scenario is a gas release of 78,000 pounds due to a tank rupture.  The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas for a 10 minute period at a rate of 7800 pounds per minute.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is 3.3 miles (using the RMP Comp model).\nAlternative scenario would be a transfer hose failure causing a 5% release of 4,000 pounds (2,000 pounds per minute for 2 minutes).  The release being stopped by human interaction.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is .3 miles.\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have resulted in any deaths, injuries, or property damage on or off site.\nSafety, both to the community and our employees, is an ongoing process at this facility.  Planned periodic maintenance evaluations are done to ensure that safe conditions and equipment are in use."
