All applicable procedures of the federal and state program are adhered to. The CPS emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\n                    \n\nCPS stores and blends liquid fertilizer for sale and application to farmland. CPS stores dry and liquid pesticides for sale and application to farmland. The facility stores the following quantities or regulated substances:\n\n\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous):\n\n?    Ammonia (anhydrous) in storage tanks        1,115,962 lbs\n\n?    Ammonia (anhydrous) in fertilizer blends    119,612 lbs\n\n?    Ammonia (anhydrous) in railcars            480,000 lbs\n\n                    TOTAL:    1,158,614 lbs\n\nRegulated Pesticides:\n\n?    Dimethoate            7,100 lbs\n\n?    Methomyl            5,400 lbs\n\n?    Paraquat dichloride        505 lbs\n\n    \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n1.    High level of training of the operators.\n\n2.    Preventative maintenance programs.\n\n3.    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n4.    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\n5.    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n\n6.    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n    \n\nThere have been no reportable releases at CPS in the past five years.\n\n    \n\nCPS will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation.\n\n"
