This is a new facility with the regulated hazardous chemical first being on site in quantities over the threshold on 6/28/08.  The facility has one refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.  The system is used to maintain temperatures in processing areas, blast freezing, and freezer storage.\r\n\r\nThe location has prepared a worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenario using the RMPComp modeling software.  \r\n\r\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \r\n\r\nCargill has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.  \r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan which address"

The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan. The facility currently relies on outside emergency teams for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  Annual training is completed with the Fresno Fire Department and local LEPC.\r\n\r\nCargill has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Cargill continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nAll necessary employees have been given access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Cargill's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, Cargill tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Cargill's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Cargill now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for [ADD YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE] employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Cargill will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
