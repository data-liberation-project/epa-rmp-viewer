Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThe top priority of J.M. Smucker LLC is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort, J.M. Smucker LLC has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, J.M. Smucker LLC will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the Longmont Fire Department to respond to the emergency.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nJ.M.
