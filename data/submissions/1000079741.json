This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety and environmental consequences in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant, located in Geismar, Louisiana, operates an olefins facility to produce ethylene, propylene, crude butadiene and debutanized aromatic concentrate from ethane and propane feedstocks. The Geismar Ethylene Plant is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant has regulated flammable substances including, propane, 1,3-butadiene, propylene, ethylene and ethane.  Additionally, the plant uses chlorine, which is also a regulated toxic substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release/Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs Steps\r\n\r\nAn accident prevention program is in place at the Geismar Ethylene Plant.  Because the process at the Geismar Ethylene Plant is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the elements of these programs are listed below. Collectively, these prevention program activities help minimize potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess H"

The MTSA is a federal law designed to protect U.S. ports and waterways from a terrorist attack.  It requires measures to control access to facilities and vessels that might be vulnerable to an incident resulting in a significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant maintains a written emergency control program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Geismar Ethylene Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency control program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Geismar Ethylene Plant processes or other Geismar Ethylene Plant facilities. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency control program for the Geismar Ethylene Plant is coordinated with the Ascension and Ibe"
