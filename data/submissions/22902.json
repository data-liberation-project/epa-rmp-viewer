      "SummaryText": "a)  Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Uni-kool Mills Facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to seasonal startup and during opeations.  These procedures identify potential sources of releases and equipment\ncorrections required to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by on-site personnel, mechanical engineers, and refrigeration contractors as required.\n\nOn -site personnel provide initial emergency response.  On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as a pump down to prevent or reduce an off site release.  Emergency response for a major release event wil be provided by local fire and police departments.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly as as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at site for a minimum of (5) years.\n\n Training and familiarity with the company's Safety and Operating Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are required by all persons responsible for Ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations.  Maintenance and operations personnel will also be required to become familiar with this RMP.\n\nb)  Description of Source and Substance Handled:\n\nThe Cooling Facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their produce and cold storage operations.  The refrigeration equipment consists of evaporator units in the cold room, pressure coolers and Portable high side trailer skids, Vacuum Tubes for produce cooling operations.\n\nc)  Worst case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were evaluated  using the methodologies recommended in the RMP off site Consequence Analysis Guidance as prepared by  EPA.  As part of this guidance a Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration was prepared to "

      "SummaryText": "identify specific release scenarios for ammonia based refrigeration systems.  The atmospheric conditions used are as specified in this guidance and the regulations.\n\nThe worst case release considers the complete release of the maximum charge in any individual system within a 10 minute period.  The alternative release considers the release of low-pressure liquid ammonia from a flange or connection leak on the piping system outside the building.  No mitigation measures are considered for each release.\n\nAs a result of the off-site consequence analysis, administrative and passive controls limit the release  of the Ammonia in the system.  For the worst case scenario, gas is released for a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated at 1.6 miles.  For the alternative release scenario, the maximum extent of the release is 308 feet off site in any direction.\n\nd)  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs described above, the program consists of pre-start up inspection, emergency response, and regular training.  A thorough review of the system incuding a Hazard and Operability Study (HazOp) was performed on June 9, 1999, Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for off site releases.  Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted annually and will incude equipment operational procedures, emergency response procedures, review of Business Response Plan procedures, and evacuation procedures.\n\ne)  Five Year Accident History:\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating to the release of ammonia have occured at the facility in the last five (5 ) years. \n\nf)  Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has implemented the State and County mandated Acutey Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan, or Business Response Plan (BRP).  This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response.\n\ng)  Planned Safety Improvements\n\nSa"
