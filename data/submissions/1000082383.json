The Water Softening Plant Chlorination Station has been installed to disinfect the water flow into the City of Hays water distribution system. The chlorination system is located on the southeast corner of the main building at 1000 Vine Street, Hays, KS. The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, additional safety equipment and a digital atmosphere reading of chlorine in parts per million, that can be read outside the chlorine storage room and in the lab. The amount of chlorine handled is 4 one-ton containers and 4 one hundred fifty pound containers. The chlorine station is checked every two hours by plant operator in a 24 hour day seven days a week and will respond to any trouble alarms which may occur in a matter of minutes.\n\n\n\nD). The general Water Sofenting Plant accident release prevention program is based on the following key elements: \n\nHigh level of training of the water plant staff .  \n\nPreventive maintenance program.\n\nUse of state-of the-art process and safety equipment. \n\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of water plant staff.\n\nPerformance of a  hazard review of equipment and procedures and an emergency evacuation plan that is in "
