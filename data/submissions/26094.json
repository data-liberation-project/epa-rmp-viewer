If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Upsala Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.                  The mzximum quanity stored would be 131,325 pounds in one 30,000 gallon tank.  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.                                  The worst case scenario would be the release of thetotal contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quanity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endp[oint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.1 miles.

The Upsala Coop Assn. has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA III (EPRCA).

Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safety conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time."
