The revised plan includes a regular preventive maintenance program for the ammonia system components, as well as programs for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.  Albertsons has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents.  The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Buena Park distribution center.  Lastly, the PSM written program places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout the Southern California that are supplied through a series of distribution and transportation complexes located throughout California. The Albertsons Refrigerated Distribution Center #8765 located on this facility site employs approximately 10 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the frozen products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nAlbertsons Buena Park distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of frozen grocery products in storage.  Albertsons? Buena Park distribution center has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment in the last five years.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Buena Park facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (Dames & Moore), and was revalidated to meet the PSM and RMP requirements.\nAlbertsons? implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management o"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \nAlbertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Buena Park distribution center.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  Albertson?s employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Albertson?s should be addressed to Albertsons? Environmental Affairs Department.\nAlbertsons has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
