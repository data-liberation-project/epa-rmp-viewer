      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAmericold - Samuels Avenue employs two independent refrigeration systems for cooler and freezer storage.  Americold's senior management is not only committed to offer a superior service but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Versacold's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Regional Safety Manager and Regional Director of Engineering.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Americold - Samuels Avenue facility is located at 1313 Samuels Avenue.  The facility is situated in an urban area approximately 2 miles from the downtown Fort Worth area.   With the exception of the condensers, all of the ammonia equipment is located inside.  The facility consists of two buildings: Building 1 was constructed in 1977 and Building 2 was constructed in 1981.  Expansions were added to both buildings in 1981 and 1986, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Americold - Samuels Avenue is to provide cooler and freezer warehousing space.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains two refrigeration systems, one in each building.  The Building 1 and 2 refrigeration systems contain approximately 13,000 and 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, respectively.  Each refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the warehouse evaporators and blast freezer units.  Typical operating conditions range from 5\" Hg on the low press"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Americold - Samuels Avenue to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia systems are operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia systems are in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Americold - Samuels Avenue's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration systems have been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches "

Operators perform inspections of each engine room and record typical operating parameters daily.  Additionally, critical process parameters are continuously monitored by an external alarm company which will alert operators in the event of an abnormal situation.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased upon the Americold - Samuels Avenue Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, there have not been any reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (May 2004 - May 2009).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\nA? save lives;\n\nA? minimize and avoid injuries;\n\nA? protect the environment; and\n\nA? minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn 1999, the refrigeration systems were thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, a Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis Study was performed in April 1, 2009.  The 2009 PHA Revalidation consisted of:\n\n\n\nA? a detailed review of the `What-ifA? log tables from the previous study;\n\nA? a series of safety checklists;\n\nA? a hazard and operability study; and\n\nA? a facility inspection.\n\n\n\nThe mitigation measures include the addition of ammonia sensors, exhaust fans, and enhanced operating procedures.
