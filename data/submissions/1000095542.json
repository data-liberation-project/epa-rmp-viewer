This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. EnLink's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n3.2 Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Belle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility consists of a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage facility that receives butanes and raw make by pipeline, as well as normal butane storage at the Belle Rose Truck Station expansion that are loaded from storage caverns or pipeline. The site consists of product storage equipment. Products are transported from the facility via pipeline.\n\nBelle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substance exceeded the threshold quantity. The listed flammable substances that are stored above threshold quantities are raw make and butane. Additionally, normal butane at the Belle Rose Truck Station are stored above threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n3.3    General Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\nProcesses at the Belle Rose/Napoleonvile storage facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 3 (RMP) regulation. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n3.3.1    Employee Participation\n\nEnLink encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\n3.3.2    Process Safety Information\n\nEnLink keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Belle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activit"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnLink primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per EnLink's Risk Management Protocol. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Belle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the station or at a minimum of every five years. The results and findings from these updates are docu"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n3.3.4    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Belle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\nIn addition, the Belle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n3.3.5    Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Belle Rose/Napoleonville storage facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ens"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n??    perform their work in a safe manner\n\n??    have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n\n??    are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n\n??    understand what they should do in event of an emergency\n\n??    understand and follow site safety rules\n\n??    inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, EnLink has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n3.3.7    Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nEnLink conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction as completed is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a qua"
