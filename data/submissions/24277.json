THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF GREENFIELD AG, HARMONY, MINNESOTA ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, LEPC, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n   A. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN NURSE TANKS FOR SALE TO FARMERS. THE MAIN STORAGE TANK FOR THIS OPERATION IS LISTED UNDER A PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED RMP. THE STORAGE TANK IS LOCATED ON A SEPERATE PIECE OF PROPERTY. THIS RMP COVERS ONLY THE FACILITYS MAIN OPERATION WHERE THE NURSE TANKS ARE TRANSPORTED TO BE WEIGHED AFTER FILLING AND SIT UNTIL THE GROWER PICKS UP THE TANK TO TRANSPORT TO HIS FARM. THE TANKS ARE ONLY ON THIS PROPERTY DURING THE MAIN USE SEASONS. \n\n   B. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION ON CROPS AS FERTILIZER NUTRIENT.\n\n   C. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE WOULD BE 4420 POUNDS IN A 1,000 GALLON NURSE TANK. *NOTE: MAXIMUM QUANTITY ALLOWED TO BE STORED IS 85% OF NURSE TANK SIZE. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PRODUCT ON SITE WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS IN TWELVE 1,000 GALLON NURSE TANKS.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n   A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A NURSE TANK OVER A 10 MINUTE TIME SPAN. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 4,420 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.31 MILES. \n\n   B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DIST"
