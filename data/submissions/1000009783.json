During risk monitoring and control, the Risk Register is reviewed for accuracy.  At this time, any new or additional identified risks not included on the risk register will be added.  Risk Monitoring and Control will be performed during the regularly scheduled risk review conducted by the RMP Project Manager and/or their designee.  Documentation is an integral part of risk monitoring and control.  Documentation will include risk review dates, any changes to the risk register, etc.  Each regularly scheduled risk review and all monitoring and control activities will be documented on the Risk Register.  A revision date for any changes made to the Risk Register must be recorded under Revision History of the register.  The revision history will record each time the plan is updated and revised.\n\n10.2.\tOzark Southside WWTP and regulated substances handled\nThe Ozark Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant is a publically owned wastewater treatment facility.  The facility is located at 2872 South Alabama Highway 123 in Ozark, Dale County, Alabama at latitude 31.388382 North and  longitude -85.609618 West, in the southwest corner of the Ewell 7.5 Minute Series Quadrangle Map in Section 23, Township 5N, and Range 24E.  The regulated substances handled at the facility include chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The maximum onsite quantity for each regulated substance is 4,400 lbs.  Chlorine is a reportable substance at the site, because it exceeds the RMP reportable threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs.  Sulfur dioxide does not exceed the RMP reportable threshold quantity of 5,000 lbs; therefore, at this time it is not included in this RMP.  \n\n10.3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility implements measures, both technological and procedural, to ensur"

The process will be reviewed and analyzed at regular intervals in conjunction with the risk identification.
