This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the facility-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. The prevention of accidental releases has been provided for through the development and implementation of design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices.\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program intends to prevent the occurrence of a highly hazardous chemical incident or to minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In the event of a highly hazardous chemical incident or accidental release, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act following the facility-specific Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\").\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nReddy Ice-Atlanta (449) located at 1578 East Taylor Avenue, East Point, Georgia 30344, is a packaged ice manufacturing and storage facility. For this facility, the Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-circuit mechanical refrigeration system. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system provides process cooling for product manufacturing and refrigerated warehouse storage to maintain product quality. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, although, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical.\n\n\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration system, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Ca"

The OCA describes the offsite exposure to surrounding areas, and the potentially affected offsite population and receptors from an accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nReddy Ice LLC has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements established by 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 through the development of a combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management (\"PSM/RMP\") Program for the ammonia refrigeration system in operation at the Reddy Ice-Atlanta (449) facility.\n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMP Program consists of fourteen performance-based elements, which are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of an accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These elements include policies and procedures for Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets. All program elements are encompassed by an established Management System that has been developed to ensure the development, implementation, and integration of the program requirements.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the PSM/RMP Program established for Reddy Ice-Atlanta (449).\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Employee Participation element provides the guidelines for involving employees in the development, implementation, and practice of"

Information collection enables employers and employees to identify, understand, and plan for the hazards posed by the ammonia refrigeration system to improve processes, process safety, and emergency response. The compiled information shall be used for many purposes, such as developing procedures and training programs. The facility-specific information is used as a resource to support PHA studies.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis element provides the guidelines for completing comprehensive analyses of the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that potential hazards are identified and controlled efficiently. The analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five [5] years. Any corrective actions required as a result of these studies shall be performed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Operating Procedures element provides the guidelines and written procedures for safely conducting activities related to the ammonia refrigeration systems. These procedures address various modes of operation, including initial startup, normal startup, normal operations, emergency operations, temporary operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following an emergency shutdown or turn around.

Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training for the modification.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Incident Investigation element provides the guidelines for promptly investigating an incident that has resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in an unintentional release of ammonia. These investigation procedures identify the situation leading to the incident, determine root-cause, and define any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five [5] years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response element provides the guidelines for planning and responding to an ammonia incident. Emergency planning and response provisions include procedures for emergency notifications, employee training, and safe evacuation of personnel. All emergency planning and response documents are reviewed regularly for verification of data and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Compliance Audit element provides the guidelines for conducting periodic audits of the PSM/RMP Program to determine whether the provisions set out under the Federal and, as applicable, State regulations are implemented.
