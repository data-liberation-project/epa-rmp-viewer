Simplot Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  J.R. Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Unit Director has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\r\n\r\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  J.R. Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increase that could cause a system failure and a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\n\r\nThe Boiler and Refrigeration Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nJ.R. Simplot Company Moses Lake Facility produces frozen potato products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 33,000 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Moses Lake Facility.\r\n\r\nC.
