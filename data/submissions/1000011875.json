      "SummaryText": "The City of Bluffton's Wastewater Treatment Plan Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been established in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EAP) 40 CFR Part 68.  The wastewater treatment plant utilizes chlorine to meet Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) and National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) effluent disinfection requirements.  The Bluffton wastewater treatment plant maintains an inventory of 2,000 to 4,000 pounds of chlorine, stored on-site in one (1) ton cylinders, in order to meet disinfection requirements.  Chlorine cylinders are stored and used inside a building.  The wastewater treatment plant serves the City of Bluffton, treating residential, commercial, institutional and industrial wastewater flows.  The average daily treated wastewater flow is 2.3 million gallons per day (MGD).  Chlorine is the only regulated chemical utilized by the Bluffton Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The purpose of the Risk ManagementPlan is to reduce the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine.  The Risk Management Program is designed to prevent the accidental releaseof chlorine, and also to define a plan for management in the event that accidental release occurs.  The Bluffton Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental release of chlorine in the past five (5) years due to excellent employee handling safety."
