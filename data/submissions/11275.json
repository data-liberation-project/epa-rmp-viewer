Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Corpus Christi Marine Loading Facility maintains a full time, dedicated emergency response team.  If a release occurs, Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) personnel from the RTFC Main Station and RTFC and Equistar personnel from the Corpus Christi Complex are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Equistar Corpus Christi Marine Loading Facility stores mixed C4 gasses, C4 raffinate, 1,3-butadiene and benzene associated with the Corpus Christi Complex.  The Corpus Christi Marine Loading Facility is located on the Corpus Christi Ship Channel adjacent to Oil Dock 8 and is approximately seven miles from the Corpus Christi Complex site.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed by Equistar to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from mixed C4 gas storage at the Marine Loading Facility.  The scenario involves the release of 6,481,355 poun"

It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 1.50 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from mixed C4 gas storage at the Marine Loading Facility.  The release is assumed to result from a failed pressure relief valve on a storage sphere.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 17,000 pounds of mixed C4 gasses in 20 minutes.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.14 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard.  A number of processes at Equistar are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit PHA.  The studies are undertaken by"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nThe Corpus Christi Complex has an excellent operating history.  During the preceding five years, there have been no fires, explosions or releases, which have significantly impacted  the plant's employees, surrounding public or the environment.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nEquistar's written emergency response plan deals with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Emergency response planning is coordinated with the Nueces County LEPC, the Refinery Terminal Fire Company, local law enforcement, the Corpus Christi Fire Department and area hospitals.   In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n \nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.\n\nEquistar is presently working jointly with the Nueces County LEPC to increase public awareness and communication in the event of a chemical release.  This includes a public education effort undertaken along with other Corpus Christi industries as well as improved radio communications to promote rapid dissemination of information."
