We have specifically addressed the dangers of this product and what to do in case of an emergency.\n\nIn regard to Pentane safety, this material is brought in by bulk container and blended with another product. It is then immediately drummed and shipped out within 24 hours of arrival. This minimizes exposure to  the volatility of the product. We take every precaution to ensure that this product does not reach the critical boiling temperature.\n\nIn regard to Aqua Ammonia safety, this material is stored in drums, outside, away from strong acids, strong alkalis, alkali metals, brass, copper, hypochlorites, and other incompatible materials. We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency spill or other release of liquid and vapor.\""
