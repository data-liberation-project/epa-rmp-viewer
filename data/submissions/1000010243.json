Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.

Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a gas to the chlorinators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS\u00c2\u00bfs can be used to help the Lewis/Upshur (local) Emergency Planning Committee (L/UEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with L/UEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur.

In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The containment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nA sump is provided to collect and contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. In reality, the sump could serve to reduce the vaporization rate of chlorine to the storage room air, and likewise reduce the rate at which chlorine gas is released from the room directly to the outside air. However, because we based our analysis on a very conservative approach, we did not take credit for the sump as a form of mitigation in reducing the endpoint distance\treached off-site.\n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response.

Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release, and also by conservatively figuring the vacuum feed system to fail at a point during a leak. The building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS endpoint distance off-site. In determining the ARS endpoint distance we have, in this case, taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors that automatically activate an alarm in the control room and the vacuum feed system. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated to initiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings). As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
