The facility has one refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.  The system is used to chill water, ice production, maintain temperatures in processing areas, blast freezing, and freezer storage.  The maximum inventory of ammonia onsite is 65,814 lbs.\n\n\n\nThis RMP was prepared to evaluate the worst-case and alternate ammonia release scenario using the RMP*Comp air dispersion modeling software.  The worst-case scenario evaluated the release of 32,000 pounds of ammonia in a vessel failure.  The analysis indicated an endpoint radius of 3.1 miles affecting a population of approximately 5,000.  The alternate release scenario involved 166 pounds of ammonia with an endpoint radius of 0.2 miles affecting an estimated population of three (3). \n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components:  process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the syste"

      "SummaryText": "m.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan which addresses accidental release of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Moniteau County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  The facility currently has a HazMat Response Team in place for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  Annual training is completed with the California Fire Department and Moniteau County LEPC.\n\n\n\nThe process hazard analysis reports prepared for the facility in May 2016 identified various recommendations to minimize the risk of accidental releases and improve safety related to the ammonia refrigeration system.  The PSM team performs regular audits of the process to ensure minimization of the risk of release. The facility works to improve process safety through the following actions:\n\n\n\n1.    An expanded PSM Program\n\n2.    Team training, MOC specific or job specific\n\n3.    Collaboration with other facilities on ammonia related problems and solutions.\n\n4.    Expanded Line Break program\n\n5.    Training of key personnel on PHA and PSM programs\n\n6.    Expanded HazMat training scenarios  \n\n7.    The company's Corporate Technical Safety Engineer requires the facility to report all releases, no matter the amount.\n\n   "
