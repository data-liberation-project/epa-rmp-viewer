The facility is committed to operating with management programs that protect both the workers at the facility and the public from accidental release of RSs.  The facility has implemented detailed training, maintenance, and inspection programs that serve to prevent releases of an RS.  OWD has an on-site HAZWOP team and emergency response team that is trained to respond to emergencies involving the chlorine system.  The HAZWOP team is trained to stop leaks and quickly repair equipment to avoid any offsite consequences.  In addition, to reduce the potential impact of a chlorine accident, OWD has committed to installing a scrubber system that will prevent chlorine from being released to the environment.  The OWD has also implemented an Emergency Response Plan and conducts drills with the Fire Department and County of San Diego HMD to ensure proper response and coordination in the event of a release of chlorine\n\nThis RMP and CalARP Program documents all of the required information and provides a summary of the OWD's plans and programs to manage risks associated with the handling of chlorine at the Ralph W Chapman Water Recycling Facility"
