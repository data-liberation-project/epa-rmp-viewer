This document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nShintech is committed to minimizing potential risks to the general public, to the facility employees, and to the environment. \r\n\r\nA fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well-trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for firefighting and emergency rescue. In addition to handling the release, the facility also participates in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\r\n\r\nDEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe Shintech Environmental Manager is responsible for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES \r\n\r\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the facility's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTRAINING \r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. All operations employees receive basic training in the facility operations.

The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  \r\n\r\nShintech is committed to minimizing potential risks to the public, employees and environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there has been one release of a regulated substance from a regulated process that has occurred that meets the criteria for RMP incident reporting. On April 13, 2016, a gas release occurred for a period of five minutes which resulted in one injury. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\n      \r\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The purpose of the ERP is to minimize potential adverse impacts on the facility and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation. The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, and terrorist threats. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including coordination with mutual aid organizations, timely notification of authorities, maintenance of proper documentation, and guidelines for compliance with applicable government regulations. Furthermore, the facility has procedures that address proper use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment. Based on job description, employees receive safety and process control training to instruct them in proper emergency response procedures. The overall ERP for the facility is coordinated with the Iberville Parish LEPC.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the plan up to date, the emergency response procedures are reviewed annually. Necessary revisions are made and di"

Affected personnel are trained regarding the changes in the ERP.\r\n\r\nShintech will meet annually with the local emergency planning and response organizations to determine how the source is addressed in the community emergency response plan and to ensure that local response organizations are aware of the regulated substances at the stationary source, their quantities, the risks presented by covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at the stationary source to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE EXERCISE PROGRAM \r\n\r\nShintech will develop and implement an exercise program for its emergency response program, including the plan required under \u00a7 68.95(a)(1). Exercises shall involve facility emergency response personnel and, as appropriate, emergency response contractors. When planning emergency response field and tabletop exercises, the local public emergency response officials will be invited to participate in the exercise. These exercises will be performed on a frequency established based on input from the local emergency response officials.  The emergency response exercise program shall include:\r\n\r\nAnnual Notification Exercise:\r\nPrior to the December 19, 2024 compliance date, Shintech will implement procedures for and conduct a notification exercises to ensure their emergency contact information is accurate and complete.  The notification exercise will occur at least once per calendar year and retained for five years and may be performed in conjunction with a tabletop or field exercise. \r\n\r\nField Exercise:\r\nThe field exercises will involve the simulated accidental release of a regulated substance (i.e., toxic substance release or release of a regulated flammable substance involving a fire and/or explosion).  The primary objective of the field exercises is to test the emergency response plan, including deployment of emergency response personnel and equipment"

      "SummaryText": "ogram soliciting safety suggestions from the workers. Shintech believes that continuous improvement is the key to success in the future. This is especially true in the safety, health, and environmental areas. Shintech continuously looks for opportunities to improve our abilities in protecting our people and our community. Shintech actively solicits and implements safety and process improvement suggestions.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN  \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), was designed to promote emergency planning and preparedness at the state, local, and tribal levels.  EPCRA helps ensure local communities and first responders have needed information on potential chemical hazards within their communities to develop community emergency response plans.  Under EPCRA, facilities with Extremely Hazardous Chemicals must notify the State Emergency Response Commission or Tribal Emergency Response Committees (TERCs) and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as well as participate in local emergency planning activities. LEPCs and TERCs are then responsible for developing a community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nShintech will meet annually with the local emergency planning and response organizations to determine how the source is addressed in the community emergency response plan and to ensure that local response organizations are aware of the regulated substances at the stationary source, their quantities, the risks presented by covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at the stationary source to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance."
