      "SummaryText": "The City of Russellville Water & Sewer Board (RWSB) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies,procedures, and management practices. They adhere to all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program. The RWSB emergency response plans which are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\nThe H.E. Neal III Water Filtration Plant processes approximately six million gallons of water a day. This plant furnishes water for the City of Russellville along with areas outside the corporate limits of the city. The treatment plant is located just west of the city, next to Lake Elliot. The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton cylinders, only one cylinder is in process at a time. The facility is manned around the clock with trained water treatment operators who can respond to any alarm that may occur.\n     (1) Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes as a vapor. The remaining unflashed liquid forms liquid-droplet aerosols. This results in he formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristic significantly different than for a cloud consisting only of chlorine gas.\n      (2) It is not appropiate to compare a 10 minute release to an one hour average standard.\n      (3) Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.\nEPA mandated certain meteorological conditions for the worst case release. Namely Atmospheric Stability Class F and wind speed of 1.5 meters/second.\nWhen atmosheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic end point of 1.3 miles. An estimate of residential population to be potentially affected was determined to be 3"

      "SummaryText": "25.\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a disk in the connection of the container to the piping. This rupture would cause a hole in the cylinder of approximately 1 inch in diameter. Using EPA approved guidelines this  of an opening would release 150 pounds/minute of chlorine. Meteorological conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D and wind speed of 3.0 meters/second gives us a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles. An estimate of 25 people potentially affected was obtained.\nThe RWSB accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n             (1) High level of training of the plant operators and personnel\n             (2) Preventive maintenance program\n             (3) Use of effective operating procedures\n             (4) Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n             (5) Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availibilty of self-contained apparatus, to be worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine detector.\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the facility in the past five years.\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Russellville Fire Department and the Franklin County LEPC. This plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. The plan in it entirety is reviewed on a periodic basis."
