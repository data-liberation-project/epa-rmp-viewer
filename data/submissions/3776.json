This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Custom chemical manufacturing..  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility:   Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride], Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], and Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-].  \n\nHydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] is used for primarily for adjusting the pH of a portion of our wastewater effluent, and in small quantities for pH adjustment of some products .  Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is used in the production of vinyl acetate polymers and copolymers.  Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] is used in the production of vinyl methyl ether copolymers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] at our facility is 107,400 pounds while Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] and Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] are present at our facility in quantities of 86,000 pounds and 42,000 pounds respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.

In this scenario, 1886 pounds of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is released through a rupture disc as the result of over pressurization of a reactor.  The vinyl acetate is released as a vapor cloud over period of 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.58 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer  is the same as that for the worst case release scenario except that the release scenario parameters correspond to those for alternate release scenarios (i.e., Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s windspeed).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.22 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (37% solution) involves a release of 437 pounds of Hydrochloric Acid from a transfer line.  The Hydrochloric Acid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrochloric Acid is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a Methyl vinyl ether storage vessel.  In this scenario 35,000 pounds of Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.23 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternate release scenario submitted for Program 2 a"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is <0.06 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHickson DanChem Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include HAZOPs, What Ifs, and Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are at least every three years .  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on 04/22/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hickson DanChem Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily a"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHickson DanChem Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHickson DanChem Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Hickson DanChem Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nHickson DanChem Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Pittsylvania County Emergency Coordinator. is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Some of the steps we are taking to improve safety at our facility include installation of additional announcement speakers and purchase of additional two-way radios to facilitate communication within the plant and with outside emergency response personnel.  These changes are expected to be implemented by December 31, 1999."
