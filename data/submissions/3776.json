Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Hickson DanChem Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Custom chemical manufacturing..  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility:   Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride], Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], and Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-].  \n\nHydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] is used for primarily for adjusting the pH of a portion of our wastewater effluent, and in small quantities for pH adjustment of some products .  Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is used in the production of vinyl acetate polymers and copolymers.  Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] is used in the production of vinyl methyl ether copolymers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] at our facility is 107,400 pounds while Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] and Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] are present at our facility in quantities of 86,000 pounds and 42,000 pounds respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the cho"

In this scenario, 1886 pounds of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is released through a rupture disc as the result of over pressurization of a reactor.  The vinyl acetate is released as a vapor cloud over period of 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.58 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer  is the same as that for the worst case release scenario except that the release scenario parameters correspond to those for alternate release scenarios (i.e., Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s windspeed).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.22 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (37% solution) involves a release of 437 pounds of Hydrochloric Acid from a transfer line.  The Hydrochloric Acid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrochloric Acid is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a Methyl vinyl ether storage vessel.  In this scenario 35,000 pounds of Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.23 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternate release scenario submitted for Program 2 a"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHickson DanChem Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include HAZOPs, What Ifs, and Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are at least every three years .  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on 04/22/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hickson DanChem Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily a"
