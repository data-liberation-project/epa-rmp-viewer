This facility satisfies the definition of a Program 3 facility as found in 40 CFR Part 68.10(d), and is therefore required to generate and maintain an appropriate RMP.\n\nPlains LPG Services, L.P. (Plains) and its affiliated limited partnerships adhere to high standards of environmental quality and are committed to operating it facilities in a manner to protect the health and safety of its employees, the communities surrounding our facilities, and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response policy of Plains is to establish, maintain, and implement emergency response procedures when necessary with the prime objective of protecting the safety and health of its employees and the public and to mitigate to the greatest extent feasible the impact to the environment.  The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority in any emergency event.  Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the secondary issues of property preservation and business recovery be addressed.\n\nThe facility is located at:\n\n5344 West M-80 Hwy\nKincheloe, Michigan  49788\n\nThe facility is in an industrial area near the Chippewa Airport complex.\n\nThe facility is fenced and contains four (4) 30,000 gallon LPG storage vessels with a maximum working capacity of 26,100 gallons each.  A pump, compressor, meter and associated piping and valves are also a part of the facility.\n\nThe only regulated substance at the facility site is Liquefied Petroleum Gas, LPG (Propane).\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis assumed a ?worst-case? catastrophic, instantaneous release of all of the LPG stored in one of the two vessels each at the maximum working capacity of 26,100 gallons, i. e, approximately 110,664 lbs.  A second ?alternate release? scenario considered was a release from a ?pull away.?  A ?pull away? can occur if a d"

      "SummaryText": "river fails to remove the hose between the storage tank and the transfer vehicle before moving the vehicle.  In this scenario, the safety valves are assumed to work as designed thus limiting the release of LPG to the contents of a 2-inch diameter hose.  The total quantity released is 17 lbs. The ?pull away? scenario is considered the most likely release that could occur. \n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis was performed with the RMP*Comp, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) consequence analysis software program.  Under the ?worst-case? scenario, the estimated distance to the 1 psi overpressure point from a vapor cloud explosion is approximately 2,112 feet or 0.4 miles.  \n\nUnder a ?pull away? scenario, the estimated distance to the 1 psi overpressure point from the released LPG vapor cloud explosion is approximately 48 feet.\n\nThe nearest public receptor to the facility is immediately East from the facility fence line and approximately 150 feet from the location of the facility storage tanks.  There are no designated environmental receptors nearby.\n\nThere are no prior accidents on record at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlains has developed written emergency response procedures to address all elements that may be encountered during planning, responding and follow-up to an emergency at the facility.  The emergency response procedures in this Risk Management Plan (RMP) are designed to comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR Part 1910.38 (Emergency Response Plans) and the emergency response element of Process Safety Management, PSM.  Specific emergency response procedures for the potential emergencies that could occur at the facility are addressed in the Plains LPG Services Emergency Response Plan, which is a separate document from this RMP.  Section 6 of this RMP discusses the Plains Emergency Response Program in additional detail.\n\nPlains does not staff an Emergency Response Team for this facility.  Plains depends upon local response authorities to conduct an appropriate r"
