We distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.\nWe have 2 anhydrous ammonia storage tanks at our facility. One tank is 26,000 gallons and the other is 30,000 gallons for a combined maximum  storage capicity of 242760 pounds.  The single largest tank has a storage capacity of 130050 pounds.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst case sscenario would be the loss of the entire contents of our 30,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over a ten minute period resulting in total vaporization of the material.  The maximum  quanitiy released would be 130050 pounds of material resulting in an off-site impact.  Faytte County Co-op has never experienced a release of this nature.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe most common alternaative release scenario would be a transfer hose failure resulting in a release of 2 minutes until manual shut down could be accomplished.  This would result in the release of 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Fayette County Co-op has never had a release of thiss type.\n\nFive-year A"
