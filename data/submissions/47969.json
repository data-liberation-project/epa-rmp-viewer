This facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1995 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, notify the Woolstock Volunteer Fire Dept (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexcepted and may very well be different and cannont be ensured to duplicate what we may have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.  \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornados, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. \n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Woolstock, Iowa location is Rick Moore, Location Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency reponse numbers are provided in the Registration Section. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location."

      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE WOOLSTOCK FERTILIZER PLANT. \n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural corp producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in storage tanks 12,000 gallons, 26,000 gallons, and two 30,000 gallon tanks. There is also 18-1,450 gallon nurse tanks, and 20- 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity stored would be 630,797 pounds. \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO: The worst case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the 1,500 gallon nurse tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gasous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp Program (Version 1/06), the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles. The alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hose. The resulting release (according to the EPA's RMP* Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles. \n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Woolstock, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  \n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State Law. In addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic)"

Finally, NEW Cooperative has extended to the Woolstock Fire Dept the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulations, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have cause any deaths , injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous system, it is the policy of NEW Cooperative to immediately notify the Woolstock Volunteer Fire Dept and the Region 5 LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event tha the Woolstock Fire Dept in unable to adequetely respond to an emergency at our Woolstock Location, mutal aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire depts) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Members of the fire dept and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In additon, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities."
