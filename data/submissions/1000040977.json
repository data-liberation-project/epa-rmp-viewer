This substance is used in the Mannich process at the facility to produce water treatment polymers. Substances that are used by Polychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part 68 and are above the minimum threshold quantity are as follows:\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances:\r\n\r\n          Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored as a 60 percent solution in water.  Per 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2), the entire weight of the flammable solution will be treated as the regulated substance when determining the threshold quantity.  The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine solution stored on-site is approximately 55,000 pounds (33,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\n\r\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical specific prevention steps have been developed. The key parts to the program are:  \r\n\r\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\r\n          Management Systems Responsibilities\r\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\r\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating\r\n          Recordkeeping Requirements\r\n          Communication and Coordination of Risk Management Information\r\n\r\n     DOT Hazardous Material Training\r\n     Contractor Performance Selection Process\r\n     Operating Procedures\r\n     Emergency Procedures\r\n     New Employee Environmental Health and Safety Orientation Training Program\r\n     Process Safety Program Auditing\r\n     Engineering Controls that Include Automatic Level and Interlock Alarms and Shutdowns\r\n     24-hour Emergency Communications\r\n\r\nAdditional"

The ERP has historically been coordinated with the county dispatcher (i.e., 911), Lackawanna County Department of Emergency Services, and Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.\r\n\r\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed. No\r\naccidental releases from covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or off-site; or resulted in off-site evacuations or sheltering in place. \r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Improvement:\r\n\r\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to promote this improvement include updating and implementing safe work practices such as:  confined space entry permits; hot work permits; pipe entry permits; lock-out tag-out procedures; and hazard communication procedures."
