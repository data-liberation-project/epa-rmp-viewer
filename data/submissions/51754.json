      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Pilgrim's Pride Live Oak Processing Facility.  The reason for submitting this RMP is to add Pilgrim?s Pride Corporation as the Owner of this facility and to identify a new Emergency contact.  This facility has two refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Because the two systems are tied together with a common transfer line, they are considered one system for the purpose of this Risk Management Plan.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the total system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Live Oak Fire Department and the District 3 LEPC and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulatio"

      "SummaryText": "ns.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as ?worst case release? and ?alternative release scenarios?.  We do have several passive and active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.  We also incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n? Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n? Preventative maintenance program\n? Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n? Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n? Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n? Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n? Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n? Up-to-date process safety information\n? Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n? Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n? Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim?s Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.  They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  Anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the regulations.  Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and air purifying respirators for the refrigeration partners, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic propert"

Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for timely completion as required.\n\nThe Pilgrim's Pride Live Oak Processing facility has an emergency response program.  This program includes an emergency response notification plan, Emergency response drills and drill evaluations conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
