      "SummaryText": "Western Cooperative Company (WESTCO) is a Farm Supply Cooperative that provides the Farmers in the Panhandle of Nebraska with farm inputs.  WESTCO was founded in 1942 and the Oshkosh Anhydrous Ammonia Plant was built at the present location in 1994 and purchased by WESTCO in 1998.  WESTCO has not had a reportable release since purchasing this plant.\n\nAnnually WESTCO inspects all of our Anhydrous Ammonia plants for the following:\n\n. Pop-off valves that protect against over filling \n. Excess flow valves that protect against a line break.  \n. Paint condition and signage on tank and lines.\n. Transfer hose condition and expiration dates.\n\nWESTCO requires our employees to be trained in the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia prior to working with the product.  This is done by classroom work, demonstration, and actual hands on training while being closely supervised.  Employees are required to wear goggles and gloves while transferring Anhydrous Ammonia and each location also has two full-face respirators available in the case of an emergency.\n\nEach of our locations has an Emergency Coordinator who is responsible for the safety of our employees and deciding if an emergency requires the assistance of Emergency Professionals such as our local fire department.\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp program."
