Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                \n\nTo insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods, Wilkesboro, NC  this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \n\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods, Wilkesboro, NC has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Tyson Foods Inc. Food Service Division is a further processing plant.  We receive raw product from other points and process mostly \"Ready to heat & eat\" products. \nIn the Process, we use Ammonia Refrigeration for controlling room temperatures as well as cooling finished products.  The Food Service Divisions Refrigeration System maintains a maximum capacity of approximately 35,000 pounds of ammonia\n \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 15,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high-pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high-pressure receiver.
