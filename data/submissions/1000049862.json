Anhydrous ammonia is listed in the RMP rule due to toxicity and has a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia is held in bulk and sold to customers who fill Nurse Tanks for fertilizing fields.  There are three (3) separate 12,000 gallon bulk tanks which are manifolded together. The bulk ammonia capacity in these tanks is approximately 157,900 Lbs.  Nine 1500 gallon Nurse Tanks with a total capacity of approximately 63,000 lbs. will be stored on site.  The total site storage capacity for ammonia is 220,900 Lbs.  The capacities of the two were added together to determine RMP applicability, based on guidance received from EPA.\n\n"
