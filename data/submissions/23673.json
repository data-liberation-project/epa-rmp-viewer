The one-ton cylinders are connected to the system via a Capitol Controls Switchover Vacuum Module 500 PPD (10 kg/h). A mechanical gas feeder valve is connected directly to the cylinder. This is a fault mechanism that will shut down the chlorine directly if failure occurs. The chlorine is then fed through a Capitol Controls Chlorine control unit Series 1450 this is fault mechanism. Lastly an Advanced gas detector by Capitol Controls monitors the system.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u00b7 Physical and Chemical Properties\n\u00b7 CAS Number\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf7782-50-5\n\u00b7 Percent\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf..99.5%\n\u00b7 Exposure Limits - (TWAs) in Ai"

Chlorine liquid is corrosive to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin.  At normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, liquid chlorine readily vaporizes to gas.  Chlorine gas causes severe irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract with eye injury, restlessness, shortness of breath, cough, choking sensation, sneezing, running nose, chest pain, dizziness, headache, nausea, cyanosis (lack of oxygen in the blood) and respiratory failure.  Following respiratory tract injury, onset of severe breathing difficulties, including bronchitis, lung edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs) and pneumonia, may be delayed and life threatening.  Exposure to concentrations as low as 5-10 ppm is reported to cause severe irritation of the eyes, nose and respiratory tract, which is intolerable after a few minutes.  The threshold odor concentration of chlorine is reported to range from 0.3-3.5 ppm. Repeated exposure to chlorine can result in loss of the ability to detect the odor of chlorine. \n\nReactivity and Corrosiveness:\n\nConditions to Avoid:  \nThe presence of moisture in gaseous and liquid chlorine corrosive attack on most common metals. Chlorine will react with water or steam to produce toxic and corrosive fumes of hydrogen chloride.  \n\n\n\nMaterials to Avoid:  \nChlorine is a powerful oxidizing agent which reacts violently with a variety of substances over a broad range of conditions including reducing agents and combustible materials."

      "SummaryText": "It should be kept away from materials such as acetylene, turpentine, other hydrocarbons, ammonia, hydrocarbons, certain metal hydrides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphides, easily oxidized materials, hydrogen ether, powdered metals, sulfur and aluminum.  Chlorine reacts with hydrogen sulfide and water forming hydrochloric acid.  It combines with carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide to form phosgene and sulfuryl chloride, respectively, which are toxic and corrosive substances.  \n\nHazardous Decomposition Products:  \nChlorine does not decompose but reacts violently to form Hydrochloric Acid and other potentially toxic and/or corrosive substances.  Chlorine is stable in steel containers at room temperature when dry.  Intense local heat on steel walls can cause the steel to react and glow in presence of chlorine.\n\nPermissible Exposure Limits:   \nOSHA's PEL for Chlorine is 5ppm, STEL is 1ppm, NIOSH's IDLH is 10ppm\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheet (MSDS):\nA copy of the chlorine MSDS is presented as Attachment A.\n Program 3 Prevention Program:\n\n1.0 \tChlorination Process Specification\n\n\u00b7 Maximum Intended Inventory:  One-ton cylinders of chlorine are used at El Mirage WWTP.  The maximum intended inventory at the chlorine facility is 4 cylinders. \n\n\u00b7 Safe Upper/Lower Limits: As referenced in the Chlorine Institute Manual, the following are considered safe limits for chlorine containers:\n\n- Safe Upper Temperature - 150\u00b0 F (Based on the limit for the fusible metal plug)\n- Safe Lower Temperature - N/A\n- Safe Upper Flow Rate - 400 lb/hr (Based on liquid chlorine at 35 psi, higher liquid discharge rates result in freezing)\n- Safe Lower Flow Rate - N/A\n- Concentration - 100%\n- Safe Upper Flow Rate - 1 - 1.5 lb/hr (Based on gaseous chlorine in cylinders)\n\n\u00b7 Evaluation of Consequences of Deviations:  The consequence of deviation from design operating conditions listed above is:\n\n\t-\tExceeding the safe upper temperature  would cause the fusible plug to yield or melt, which would cause the c"

The MOC program also ensures that process changes affecting existing procedures are reflected in new written procedures.  \n\nWritten Procedures to Manage Changes         \n\nWhenever a design or operational change is proposed, the responsible person must determine if any of the following will change:\n\n\u00b7 process chemistry, changes in chemical reaction, or chemical phase\n\u00b7 quantity or composition of chlorine, additives, or reactants that would affect the chlorine\n\u00b7 safe operating limits pertaining to temperature, pressure, and flow rates\n\u00b7 consequences of deviation from safe operating limits\n\u00b7 operating procedures\n\u00b7 electrical classification or materials of construction\n\u00b7 design specifications\n\u00b7 other affected equipment, operations, or procedures\n\u00b7 If any of the items listed above are changed by the proposed process change, then MOC procedures shall be followed .\n\n\n\nConsiderations Prior to Any Change\n\n\u00b7 Technical Basis for the Proposed Change:  There shall be a sound technical basis for the change.  In other words, the change should bring about an improvement in production, quality, efficiency, safety, or cost.  If there is not a sound technical basis for the change, it shall not be undertaken.\n\n\u00b7 Impact of Change on Safety and Health:  If the otherwise advantageous change would bring about a detrimental effect on employee safety or health, there shall be counter measures taken to ensure that the level of safety and health is not adversely affected after the change.

The worst-case release quantity (2000 pounds) is equal to the greatest amount of chemical held in a vessel or the greatest amount held in a pipe. \n\nThe worst-case quantity (2000 pounds) is assumed to be released over a ten minute time period.  This assumption applies to the chlorine at the site.  \n\nThere is no need to explain how a worst-case release might occur; cause is not an issue.  The rulemakers recognize that such a release is extremely unlikely to occur. Likewise, the meteorological conditions that must be assumed for a worst-case analysis are very unlikely to occur simultaneously.
