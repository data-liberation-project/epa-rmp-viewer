The plant consists of a raw water reservoir, raw water pumps, flocculation tanks, sedimentation basins, dual media filters, a chlorination system for disinfection, a clearwell and distribution pumps.  The plant began operations in 1986 and was expanded in 1994.  The facility is owned and operated by the Cherokee County Water and Sewerage Authority (CCWSA).\n\nChemical Safety\n\nThe CCWSA complies with Hazardous Communications standard set forth by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  Compliance is accomplished by compiling a hazardous chemical list, using Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), ensuring that containers are labeled, and providing employee training.  The purpose of the program is to alert and educate employees about chemicals in the workplace by giving them greater access to information on the physical and health hazards of chemicals, safe handling and storage precautions and emergency first aid procedures.  It applies to all employees who may be exposed to hazardous substances during the scope of their employment.  Copies of the written program are available for the employees.\nEach department head maintains a list of all hazardous chemicals used by their departments.  These lists are updated as necessary.  Each employee in charge has available a list of chemicals applicable to their area of employment.\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) provide specific information on chemicals used.  Each department head maintains a binder containing all MSDS for every chemical substance used by employees in their department.  A binder containing all MSDS on every chemical substance purchased and used by the city is available to all employees.  Aside from the main MSDS binder, department heads make their MSDS binder available and accessible to their respective employees.\n\nAccident release Prevention Program\nActive environmental, health, and safety "

      "SummaryText": "programs with regards to the safe handling of chlorine and chlorination equipment are in place at the plant.  The following safety policies and procedures are adhered to by CCWSA staff.\n\nHandling:\n- All operators are trained in safe handling of chlorine, but the maintainace staff has the task of changing the chlorine cylinders..\n- A Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) must be used, when connecting or disconnecting chlorine cylinders.  Self-contained breathing equipments are available wherever gas or liquid is in use.   These unit are approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety an Health (NIOSH)\n- The two-man rule is used for all connecting and disconnecting of chlorine cylinders (two men present, one in SCBA the other on standby).\n- Adequate ventilation shall be provided at all times.\n- It is optional to use the chlorine detectors (detects chlorine concentrations so small that they are impossible to smell.  A chlorine detector can give early warning, so a small leak can be stopped before it becomes larger).\n\nOne Ton Chlorine Cylinder Storage:\n- Cool, clean, and dry place with adequate ventilation.\n- Away from other chemicals and equipment.\n- Always use lifting clamps or cradles - do not use ropes, cables or chains when moving.\n- Keep the protective cap on the cylinder when it is not in use.\n- Make empty containers and store them aside from full containers.\n\nFirst Aid:\n- First aid for eyes exposed to chlorine is immediate irrigation with flowing water for at least 15 minutes, and contact physician immediately.\n- If  skin is exposed to liquid chlorine, it can cause burns.  The skin should be washed with flowing water for 30 minutes.  If the skin is burned, contact a physician immediately.  Chlorine gas can become trapped in the clothing and react with body moisture to from hydrochloric acid which could burn the skin.  Remove the clothing of the victim and wash the body with water.\n- In case of inhalation, remove the victim to fresh air, administer "

NEVER go into a room containing chlorine gas with harmful concentration in the air without a self-contained air supply, protective clothing and help stand by.\n\nAccident History:\nAn accidental release has not occurred at the Etowah River Water Treatment Plant within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Etowah River Water Treatment Plant is included in the community?s emergency response plan.  Responses to incidents are handled by the Office of Fire Emergency Management.\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\nThe Etowah River Water Treatment Plant will continue to provide operator training and periodically review its polices and procedures, but is not planning any major safety changes."
