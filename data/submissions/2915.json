Chlorine is regulated by 40 CFR 68  Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nThe City of Siloam Springs certifies that they have had no reportable accidents within the last five (5) years.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered is a full 2,000 pound container of chlorine released in 10 minutes.  The distance to worst-case toxic endpoint is 2.23 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/outside air  shed w/1 side open.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered, is a full 2,000 pound container released through a broken 5/16 inch container valve in 133 minutes.  The distance to alternative toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles. Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/outside air  shed w/1 side open.\n\nThere are public receptors: Residencies, Schools, Hospitals, Prison/Correctional Facilities, Recreation Areas and Major commercial, office, or industrial areas within the worst case toxic end point.  Therefore SS  Daniel Water Treatment Plant Program Level is Program 2.\n\nThe Program 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program is directed toward reduction of the probability of accidental releases of chlorine at this location.
