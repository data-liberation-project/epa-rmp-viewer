Our facility has one 11,000-gallon tank, one 8,000-gallon tank, and one 6,000-gallon tanks, and equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1.\tExcess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2.\tPressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent over pressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3.\tInspections by insurance loss control specialists to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Gruver Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA a release according to this scenario would include several residences in the Berstein area, but no hospitals, school, or commercial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA\u00bfs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, such a release would not affect any residences, hospitals, schools, or commercial areas.\n\nOur registr"
