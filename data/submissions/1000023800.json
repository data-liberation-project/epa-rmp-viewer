This is a corporate program applied to all National Oilwell Varco (NOV) facilities, and reflects overall management commitments to Health, Safety, & the Environment as well as compliance with the relevant federal , state, and local regulations. The policies and procedures at this facility include the requirements of both the OSHA Process Safety Management program and the EPA Risk Management program and are currently implemented by NOV Tuboscope??A?s Coating Research Director and the Facility Manager. The main features of the program are the use and review of operating and maintenance procedures, including the review of process hazards, training, process safety and equipment inspections, and the use of backup systems where appropriate.\n\nThe emergency response program, in coordination with local emergency responders, sets procedures for notifying the public including requirements for emergency health care, personnel training, and emergency response drills. These are outlined and recorded at the Plant 3 facility as part of the Process Safety Management plan for the resin manufacturing process.\n\nThe resin manufacturing facility manufactures phenolic-formaldehyde resins, which are used in NOV's manufacturing of paints and coatings used at other plants. The process uses a water formaldehyde solution called formalin and phenol as the raw materials for the resin production. At this facility, only formaldehyde (formalin) is present in quantities above the triggering thresholds outlined under the EPA RMP (40CFR68) and OSHA PSM (29CFR1910.119) programs.\n\nBased on interviews with the facility personnel, in the last five years there have not been any reportable accidents or incidents resulting in offsite injuries or threats to the public.
