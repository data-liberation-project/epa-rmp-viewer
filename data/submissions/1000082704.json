      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1.    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies \n\nThe idle Enterprise Providence Terminal was purchased by Blackline Partners LLC in 2018 and the terminal is now named Sea-3 Providence, LLC (Sea-3).  \n\nWe conducted a very thorough inspection and evaluation of the Providence Terminal which was idled and deregistered in 2016.  Sea-3 has conducted an extensive recommissioning project that improved the terminals safety, equipment and policies and procedures to meet our standards and those of the EPA, OSHA, US Coast Guard as well as local and State of Rhode Island requirements.  Sea-3 management and staff are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental, health and safety.  Our commitment is demonstrated by the improved design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at Providence Terminal.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to eliminate or prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our response activities are coordinated with Rhode Island Hazardous Material Planning District 5.  Our prevention program a d response will help minimize the release and its impacts.  \n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOur terminal's primary activity is the receipt, storage and shipment of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  We have two (2) regulated substances held at above both EPA and OSHA threshold quantities are present at our terminal.  These substances are propane and ethyl mercaptan (ethane thiol).  Both are listed as flammable.  Propane is a gas and ethyl mercaptan is a liquid.  Propane is received as a refrigerated liquid by marine vessels, stored on-site and transformed to a liquid under pressure.  It is loaded in to trucks for distribution in the Providence area and other nearby states.  Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane delivered to trucks for safety purposes.  Both compounds"

Details on the amount of flammable materials held on the terminal site are contained in the RMP data elements.  \n\n\n\n3.  Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involve a catastrophic release from Tank Storage.  The scenario involves the release of the contents of the large refrigerated propane storage tank, which contains the largest single quantity of flammable material at the terminal.  The Environmental Protection Agency's RMP-Comp program was used to calculate the distance to a 1 psi overpressure endpoint for the calculated release.  The alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Storage and Transfer.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  This scenario is based on the rupture of a 3-inch truck loading line and assumes that active measures (hydrocarbon detectors and automatic shut-off devices) stop the flow within 20 seconds.  The maximum amount of propane vented is assumed to be involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  Details on the alternate case scenario are contained in the RMP registration data elements.  \n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps  \n\n\n\nOur terminal has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR Part 1910-119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that was revised, implemented and are currently in place at the Providence terminal.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSea-3 maintains a record or Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all applicable processes.  \n\n\n\n"

The HAZOP methodology is primarily used to carry out these analyses.  Hazard Analysis revalidations are conducted to review the previous hazard analysis and to review modifications made to the terminal since the last hazard analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified, trained personnel with expertise in: engineering, process operations. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThese are revalidated at regular intervals of not more than five (5) years or as needed.  Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  Sea-3 maintains written operating procedures to ensure safe operations.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available at our terminal ID:  100000175981; Sea-3 Providence terminal staff are involved in the processes. \n\n\n\nTraining \n\nSea-3 has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSea-3 carries out maintenance checks, calibrations, inspections and tests on process equipment to ensure proper, safe operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detectors, and temperature and pressure switches.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.  \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice by Sea-3.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, installation and operating or maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  We use a comprehensive checklist of either new or modified processes.\n\n \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSea-3 conducts compliance audits to confirm our program meets RMP, PSM and good engineering practices.  An audit was conducted prior to recommissioning the terminal and will be carried out at least every three (3) years.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be addressed and implemented as soon as possible to improve compliance with the requirements of the RMP and PSM rules.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSea-3 investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the cause(s) leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSea-3 believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a life critical team effort.
