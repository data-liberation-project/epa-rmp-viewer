IF AN \r\n      ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL\r\n      FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE \r\n      IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n2.

ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT  APPLICATION AS A CROP NUTRIENT.   THE STORAGE AND HANDLING CONSIST OF 2 STORAGE TANKS (22,000 GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\r\n\r\n      THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD  BE 307,811\r\n      POUNDS.
