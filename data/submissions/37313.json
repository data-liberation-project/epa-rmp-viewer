The Company's officers, managers, and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Mountaire has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The Company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMountaire Farms Inc. is a chicken slaughter and processing facility.  Chickens are trucked in from nearby farms slaughtered and processed for human consumption.  To preserve the meat and prevent bacteria contamination, anhydrous ammonia, an EPA regulated substance is used.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMountaire Farms has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized stan"

      "SummaryText": "dards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Mountaire Farms, Lumber Bridge facility, has not had any reportable ammonia releases in the last five years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.).  Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams.  Additional training with outside organizations are also conducted.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include:  improved maintenance procedures and preventive maintenance periodicity; addition of new technology as it becomes available; and continued training of plant and response personnel."
