The Risk Management Plan was conducted to fulfill the requirements of EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 under the Clean Air Act.  The hazardous material used in the refrigeration system is anhydrous ammonia.  The threshold quantity for this regulated substance is 10,000 lbs.  Crane & Crane has approximately 14,200 lbs of ammonia in their system.  The largest vessel could potentially release 9,423 lbs.\n\n\n\nCrane & Crane's prevention program is based on the following:\n\n * Initial and continued training of personnel\n\n * Preventative maintenance program as described in the PSM program\n\n * Use of safety equipment and procedures\n\n * Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nCrane & Crane complies with:\n\n * Osha's and Washington State's process safety management rules\n\n * Washington State's safety regulations\n\n * IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards and good work practices.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected; engine room doors are generally closed, tight fitting and open outwards; computerized controls allow remote operation of system; suction trap hi-level float; high discharge pressure shut down; low suction pressure shut down; high discharge temperature discharge temperature shut down; oil pressure failure shut down; high amperes shut down; automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls; oil filters plugged shut down; 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations; and 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situation.\n\n\n\nCrane & Crane, Inc has had no accidents or ammonia releases in the past 5 years that have caused significant on-site or off-si"

Crane & Crane employees have not been trained to respond to a large release of ammonia, and do not have the necessary equipment. Supervisors will report possible release to the Response Coordinator, who will communicate with Evacuation Coordinator and initiate evacuation when necessary.  Coordinator will call 911.  Employees will be evacuated to the appropriate assembly area and the Fire Department will take charge of the situation upon arrival.\n\n\n\nCrane & Crane uses a Hot Work Permit Program, Lock-out/Tag-out System and Confined Space Entry Program.  Employees have been trained on these programs, as well as Standard Operating Procedures.  Refresher training for refrigeration personnel is completed annually.  Mechanical Integrity is ongoing, with details of any issue documented and followed up on.  Mechanical Integrity is key in operating a safe, efficient and compliant system.  \n\n\n\n"
