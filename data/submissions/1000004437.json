The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Twin State, Inc.,\nare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe administration of Twin State is located in its central office at 3541 East Kimberly Road, Davenport, Iowa, and has the responsibility for the oversight and administration of all activities on the Durant, Iowa, property.  Therefore, the officers of Twin State are responsible for the administrative controls that include the following:\n\nThe review of right to know and procedures to follow with respect to all raw materials on the Durant property, the dangers involved to personnel and to properties beyond that of Twin State, that includes the notification to the Fire Department in Durant, Iowa, and notification to the Cedar County Emergency Planning group and the Department of Natural Resources for the state of Iowa.\n\nAt the present time, the oversight administration is chaired by R. Hovey Tinsman, Jr., at the Davenport office with the assistance of Joe Grell, manager of all processing at the Durant property.\n\nWith respect to mitigation measures to limit the distance of products on the property, it should be noted that anhydrous ammonia is a gas when vaporized at ambient conditions and, therefore, is only protected by dilution in the air and is assisted by the plant being located on 116 acres of property, at a substantial distance from any residents, and located 1 A? miles from the town of Durant.\n\n2.    Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is t"

The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 140,196 pounds in the facilityA?s one 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 85% capacity.\n\nThere are no additional nurse tanks on the property for any additional storage of anhydrous ammonia since the products use is only for ammoniation of phosphoric acid as part of the plant process and is not used for direct application.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered from time to time in rail cars.  The tank capacity of the rail car is 30,000 gallons filled to an 85% capacity and the tank car has a maximum weight of 140,196 pounds of product.  Inasmuch as the annual ammonia consumption is represented by 30 cars of anhydrous ammonia and the normal time on the property would be 2 or 3 days, there usually is only 1 car on the property at any given time.\n\nWith respect to worse case scenario, a rail car of ammonia would have the same conditions as the storage vessel into which the ammonia is transferred.\n\nSecondary purposes of the property are to provide nitrogen solution storage that is reshipped to distribution centers and to provide the necessary raw materials to make potash and micronutrient additions for N-P-K-S-Zn finished product grades.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the \nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.  This was calculated by multiplying the water capacity of the storage tank by 4.6732, which represents the pounds of ammonia per gallon of water tank capacity.  The distance to the dispersion endpoint based on the DEGADIS Model is 2.4 miles.\n\nThe  Alternative-Case Release Scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2A? transfer hose with 11,908 pounds released over 2 minutes.

The storage vessel for anhydrous ammonia is protected by a steel barrier from invasion by vehicle.  With respect to protection against vandalism, the tank is locked and there are no hose connections but rather it is piped to the reactor with permanently-mounted piping.\n\n4.     The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and \nRegulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations are administered by the Iowa Department of Agriculture consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.      The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of \nanhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  To our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases that have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written action plan in \naccordance with OSHA standard CFR 1910.38 and provided state and local authorities and emergency planning and committee right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Upgrade:  The plan has been upgraded from the original risk management plan required of 1999 to further include safety information, operating procedures, training, maintenance, incident investigation, compliant audits and emergency action in order to protect employees and steps taken to reduce the risk of hazardous material release. \n\n8.

      "SummaryText": "Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations for implementation at this time.  \n\nThe type of competency testing used is a personal review by the plant manager, Joe Grell.  Training practices are based on a two-man buddy system involved with the processing and ammonia transfer under the guidance of Mr. Grell.  No one on the property is allowed to be involved in ammonia transfer and use other than those assigned for processing by Mr. Grell which at this time involves only three people.\n\nThis plan is to be reviewed annually and signed off on by members of the staff at the Durant plant.  This would include a statement of annual meeting with the local emergency planning committee of Durant and county government at Tipton in Cedar County, Iowa."
