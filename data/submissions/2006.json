OUR FACILITY STORES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WHICH IS USED AS A FERTILIZER.  THE FACILICTY IS USED IN THE SPRING FROM APRIL TO JUNE AND FRON OCTOBER TO FREEZE UP, NORMALLY IN NOVEMBER.\n  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO COULD AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 650 PEOPLE.  THIS SCENARIO IS VERY UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT INSTALLED AT THE FACILITY AND THE COMPANIES COMITTMENT TO SAFETY TRAINING  AND MAINTANENCE OF THIS EQUIPMENT.\n  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD AFFECT COMPANY PROPERTY AND APPROXIMATELY 10 PEOPLE. (EMPLOYEE'S AND CUSTOMERS).\n  TWICE EVERY YEAR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,RESCUE SQUAD AND AMBULANCE SERVICE ARE INVITED TO OUR FACILITY.  EMERGENCY SHUT-OFFS, POWER AND PLUMBING CODES ARE LOOKED AT.  AT THIS TIME WE DISCUSS OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AND HOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES FIT INTO OUR PROGRAM.  WE DISCUSS CHANGES NEEDED TO IMPROVE RESPONSE TIME AND SAFETY TO ALL INVOLVED.\n  IN THE FUTURE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRAINING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH INCLUDES FIRE DEPARTMENT, RESCUE SQUAD,AMBULANCE,LEPC,LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A LOCAL CONTRACTOR.  IN THE FUTURE WE WILL AGAIN SETUP A MOCK ACCIDENT WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES.\n  OUR GOAL IS TO REMAIN ACCIDENT FREE AND PROVIDE A CLEAN AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT."
