Facility Overview: The AGRO-Nashville facility is a refrigerated warehousing operation providing cold storage rental space to numerous clients with various refrigerated products. The facility is regulated under Risk Management Program (RMP) due to onsite anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000 pounds RMP applicability threshold. The facility's only RMP covered process is the ammonia refrigeration system used to refrigerate various areas of the facility.\n\n\n\n?<    * July of 2007 - NRS constructed an entirely separate process (Engine Room 2) containing 5,400 Lbs. of the regulated substance Anhydrous Ammonia. NRS did not report this addition due to the fact it is below the 10,000 pounds threshold. \n\n?<    * November of 2014 - Nashville Refrigeration Services (NRS) was acquired by AGRO\n\n?<    * March of 2015 - AGRO completed the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAGRO decided to include the combination of both Engine Room 1 (ER-1),and Engine Room (ER-2) in this resubmission that totals 18,400 pounds of NH3.\n\n\n\nB. Chemical Safety Overview: The facility overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing Tennessee Occupational Health and Safety Administration (TOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119 already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for ammonia in response to the RMP requirements. The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's PSM and RMP programs and incudes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (i.e. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance for ammonia).\n\n\n\nC. Five-Year Accidental History: The facility has had TWO (2) RMP reportable accidents/releases of ammonia within the past five years. In that same year period, there have been no near miss situations.\n\n\n\nD. Prevention Program: The fa"
