The City also operates one\nother stationary source subject to the federal RMP regulations. A separate RMP has been submitted for that Plant.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as\nset forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety\nCode (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part\n68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal\nAccidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at the Plant which involve the storage,\nhandling and/or use of chlorine.\n\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing two\nreactor-type clarifiers (that provide flocculation and sedimentation) and four dual media gravity\nfilters. The Plant's raw water source is Mill Creek. Water from the after bay of the Edison Mill\nCreek #1 Powerhouse travels via pipeline to the Cooley Hat where it is delivered to the influent\nof the Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant. The untreated or raw water entering the plant contains\nsand, suspended particles, and microorganisms, collectively referred to as turbidity, that must be\nremoved before the water enters the distribution system. The basic treatment processes include a\nsand chamber, flocculation basins, sedimentation basins, and filters. Polymers and other chemicals are added at various points to condition and treat the water. Chlorine is added for\nwater disinfection. Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP require"

Liquid chlorine is\nreceived in one ton containers via truck and stored in the chlorine storage room on trunnions. The\ntrunnions are fabricated from steel and have cadmium plated steel rollers. A maximum of six full\none ton containers (i.e., a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds) may be present inside the\nchlorine storage room at any time.\n\nThe two chlorine scales are sized to hold one standard one ton containers each (each chlorine\ncontainer has a total weight of approximately 3700 pounds of which 2000 pounds is chlorine.\nEach of the scales has a heavy duty bushed bearing trunnion to permit cylinder rotation. The\ncontainer weight is displayed on a wall mounted 18-inch diameter dial. The containers are\nshuttled on and off of the scale and delivery truck by a hoist.\n\nFrom the containers, flexible connections lead to the chlorine header. From the chlorine header, a\none-inch chlorine gas line leads to the chlorinators. Automatic switchover valves are provided on\nthe discharge piping of the chlorine ton containers. This allows an automatic switchover between\nthe lead container and the ''standby' container when the lead container supplies insufficient\nchlorine gas pressure. For each container, one line is provided leading to a downstream\nchlorinator.\n\nChlorinators and Injectors\n\nTwo floor standing chlorinators are located i"

The principal units included\nin each chlorinator are as follows: an indicating rotameter, a V-notch variable cross-section\norifice for metering, a manual feed rate adjuster for the orifice, a vacuum differential regulating\nvalve, and an automatic feed controller for the orifice.\n\nA vacuum is formed within each of the chlorinators by utility water passing through the injector.\nWhen the water moves through the injector a suction is created that opens the differential\nregulating valve and the vacuum relief valve. The entire unit is full of air at this point as the\nchlorine supply line has not yet been opened. When the chlorine feed line is opened, the vacuum\nrelief valve closes replacing the air in the chlorinator with chlorine gas.\n\nEach of the two injectors consists of a venturi-type nozzle with vacuum gauge and a ball valve.\nChlorine gas is drawn from the chlorinator through a one-inch PVC pipe into the venturi, where\nit mixes with utility water. The water is supplied via a two-inch utility water line that is equipped\nwith a plug valve and a ball check valve. The resulting chlorine solution is conveyed through\nseparate lines to the chlorine solution distributor.\n\nChlorine Solution Piping\n\nUpon leaving the injectors, the two chlorine solution lines lead to two rotameters. The two\nrotameters allow the chlorine solution to be directed to the two main feed points (the flash mix\nbasin and the clearwell).\n\nChlorine Residual Analyzer\n\nThe two chlorine residual analyzers continually measure and record the residual chlorine content\nin the plant effluent (one measures the residual chlorine content of the clarified well and the other\nmeasures the residua chlorine content in the clearwell). If a level of chlorine is detected below\nthe desired level, a low chlorine residual alarm signal is sent to the main control panel.\n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n-\n\nThe RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their"

These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release\nscenarios. Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed\nbelow.\n\nCHLORINE\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, one of the one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic\nfailure due to an unknown external event. This scenario could be initiated by an external event\n(i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine building where the ton containers\nare located). It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.\nHowever, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event can not be completely\ndiscarded. This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely. In the highly unlikely case that\nthis scenario occurs, approximately 2,000-pounds of chlorine would be released. The release of\nchlorine could occur outdoors or indoors. Since the release can occur outdoors (i.e., outside of\nthe chlorine storage building) the enclosure provided by the chlorine building was not taken into\naccount in evaluating the off-site consequences. Rather, it was assumed that the chlorine released\nduring the catastrophic accident was released outdoors forming a cloud of chlorine vapor. The resulting vapor cloud was assumed to freely migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this accidental release scenario is approximately 1.3-miles.\n\nFigure ES-1 presents a graphical representation of the vulnerable zones for the worst-case release\nscenario for accidental releases involving chlorine.

In order to be conservative in the estimation of the\nvulnerable zone, it was assumed that 10-pounds of chlorine was released during an accident\ninvolving the complete failure of a vapor transfer line from a one ton container. In such a\nsituation, the loss of vacuum from the system would result in the automatic isolation of the one\nton container at the container valve. However, in order to be conservative, it was assumed that\nthe material was released directly outdoors (although the full length of the vapor transfer lines is\nlocated indoors. Thus, the system enclosure provided by the chlorine building was not taken into\naccount in evaluating the off-site consequences. Utilizing this assumption is much more conservative in nature and resulted in the estimation of the largest vulnerable zone for these types\nof accident scenarios.
