The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\nThe Linde Gas North America LLC facility located in Union City, GA, complies with US EPA's accident prevention rule, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  All process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA standards. If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our acetylene storage/handling\n\nsystems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Fulton County Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency. In addition, we have implemented programs related to Process Safety Management and Security Vulnerability Risk Assessment. Corporate / Senior management provides support for all compliance requirements through raining        information and training programs. Monthly safety meetings are required by corporate policy.\n\n\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Linde facility manufactures acetylene. Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of chemical acetylene trailers, a medium pressure acetylene generator, and a high-pressure cylinder filling area.  Acetylene is compressed using chemical acetylene stored on trailers that have acetylene cylinders manifolded together. The piping from the manifold runs to the generator and compressor room. The supply lines are equipped with pull away protection, flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2\" orifice plates, large flash arrestor, and check valves to protect against reverse flow. For backup purposes, the acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a lowpressure acetylene generator and a high-pressure cylinder filling area. The low-pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and"

The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our acetylene storage systems, it is Linde Gas' policy to immediately notify the Fulton County Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency. We have communicated this policy with the Fulton County Fire Department. All members of the Linde emergency response team are\n\nproperly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility. All employees have access to Linde emergency action plan. Emergency response training, including fire drills, is conducted annually.\n\n\n\n6.
