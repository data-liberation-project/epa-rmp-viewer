      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the PMC Organometallix Carrollton production facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tPMC Organometallix policies;\r\n\u00b7\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00b7\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00b7\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00b7\tFive year accident history;\r\n\u00b7\tEmergency Response Plan;\r\n\u00b7\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at the Carrollton plant for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  PMC Organometallix is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \r\n\r\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Plant Manager.  Management routinely dedicates time for review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through the facility, where plant personnel regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of PMC Organometallix HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.  \r\n\r\nPMC ORGANOMETALLIX POLICIES:\r\n\r\nPMC Organometallix HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill the company's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES COVERED PROCESSES:\r\n\r\nThe PMC Organometallix Carrollton facility is located at 2316 Highland Ave."

      "SummaryText": ", Carrollton, Kentucky.  The facility is a specialty chemical manufacturer.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.  These substances are present in the covered processes at the following levels:\r\n\r\nChemical\tQuantity\r\nChlorine (Cl2)\t720,000 pounds\r\nMethyl Chloride (MeCl)\t425,000 pounds\r\n\r\nChlorine and methyl chloride are used as process feedstocks. Phosphorous Trichloride (PCL3) was reported in the original RMP submittal in 1999. Since that time, the plant has discontinued the product made with PCL3 and no longer stores or processes this chemical.  There are no flammable chemicals above the threshold quantity at this facility.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT:\r\n \r\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a liquid chlorine rail car during depressurization.  Chlorine is received as a liquid in pressurized rail cars and fed directly into the process.  The capacity of a rail car is 90 tons, and this quantity, along with any residuals in the system or depressurization rail car (<10 tons), was assumed to be released over 10 minutes in the worst case scenario.  \r\n\r\nHazard assessment modeling shows that, under worst case weather conditions, the worst case release could produce a chlorine plume that could travel more than 25 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.  It should be noted that both regulatory agencies and PMC believes that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event.  This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by PMC to reduce the risk of this type of event.  \r\n\r\nThe multiple layers of preventative measures make it unlikely that a significant chlorine release will occur.  Chlorine rail cars are built with extreme integrity and safety precau"

The rail cars are rigorously designed and tested according to the procedures and schedules recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, PMC Organometallix has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.   These include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tSite emergency action plan;\r\n\u00b7\tChlorine detectors;\r\n\u00b7\tAlarm system initiated by chlorine detectors;\r\n\u00b7\tPlant emergency alarm system;\r\n\u00b7\tOperators trained to make an initial response;\r\n\u00b7\tOn-site emergency response team for each shift trained at the Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) technician level;\r\n\u00b7\tMedical department on-site; \r\n\u00b7\tNotification to LEPC to activate Community Response Plan.\r\n\r\nOne alternative scenario for each regulated toxic substance was also developed in the hazard assessment.   A description of each of these scenarios and the estimated distance of the potential impacts is as follows.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine is the failure of the valve packing on a railcar, and the chlorine plume was estimated to go 0.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors. The alternative release scenario for methyl chloride was a release from a pipe leak, and the methyl chloride plume was estimated to go 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.  These alternative release scenarios are somewhat more likely than the worst-case scenario, but are still unlikely events.  This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by PMC Organometallix to reduce the risk of these types of events.  \r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nWhile the alternative release scenarios are, by definition, more likely than the worst-case scenario, they are still unlikely given the facility's prevention program.  If a release should occur, PMC Organometallix has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.  T"

This prevention program covers those processes that use chlorine and methyl chloride above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tIn-depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under OSHA PSM standards;\r\n\u00b7\tWritten operating procedures (updated annually) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\r\n\u00b7\tOperators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified and trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;  \r\n\u00b7\tA safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly; \r\n\u00b7\tA management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are reviewed and implemented safely;\r\n\u00b7\tCritical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating condition;\r\n\u00b7\tPre-startup reviews are done to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\r\n\u00b7\tIncidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; and \r\n\u00b7\tRoutine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\r\n\r\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves our employees and strives for continuing improvements in accident reduction.

      "SummaryText": "personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.  \r\n\r\nMeasures that would prevent the worst-case scenario primarily consist of chemical handling policies and standard operating procedures to ensure care in moving rail cars near and within the facility.  Delivery and on-site rail car handling personnel are highly trained and skilled, and rail cars are moved at very low speeds.  The integrity of the vessels themselves is maintained through the mechanical integrity program via the aforementioned vessel inspections and tests.  The rail cars are also protected from over pressurization with a pressure relief system.\r\n\r\nPotential hazards that could produce a catastrophic release are strictly controlled.  Rail cars are spotted and moved only in areas with no overhead construction or equipment that could fall and impact a car.  Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk of sabotage.  Construction throughout the facility is non-combustible, and fire hazards are strictly controlled.  The risk of fire induced vessel failure is extremely low.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine was selected as a valve packing failure.  Prevention steps for this scenario include preventative maintenance and standard operating procedures for connecting the rail cars to the process.  An excess flow valve is present on the liquid connection within all chlorine rail cars.  The valves are designed to limit the rate of release to no more than 15,000 pounds per hour.  Remote operated valves that can be closed from the control room should a problem occur.  This would serve to limit the release  and therefore, reduce the potential for off-site impact in the unlikely event of a release.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is the release from a pipe leak.    Piping release scenarios could result from failures of flanges or fittings, or from a hole in the transfer piping.  Pr"

Prevention steps for this scenario include strict adherence to piping and pipe support design standards, proper maintenance, inspections and tests under the mechanical integrity program.  Maintenance work practices are controlled to prevent mechanical impact or other piping stresses.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 1999 to the present, there have been no accidents/releases of regulated substances from covered processes that meet the criteria for the Five Year Accident History, which are focused on serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no accidental releases at the facility for the past ten years. PMC Organometallix realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year accident History.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:\r\n\r\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation with local officials from the Local Emergency Planning Committee and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.  The plan also includes documentation of proper first-aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; a description of the training program for all employees in relevant emergency response procedures; and procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes"
