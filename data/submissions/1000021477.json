Facility start-up should occur the week of May 23, 2011 or later.\n \n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDominion Transmission, Inc. (DTI) is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that addresses the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the facility. It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to initiate the emergency response plan to mitigate the effects of the release and will contact 911 (Washington County OES).\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility consists of six 90,000 gallon propane storage tanks that are designed to receive propane from an underground pipeline.  These tanks are administratively limited to 88% of its full capacity.  Propane stored in the tanks is transferred into trucks at the facility's two truck transport loading stations.  The maximum inventory of propane at the facility is 2 million pounds. No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.   This facility was designed to conform to the requirements of NFPA 58: LP-Gas Code, API 2510: Design and Construction of LPG Installations where applicable, NFPA 70: National Electrical Code, Dominion specifi"

This facility maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of propane, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the entire propane process. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  DTI conducts these comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and managed. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and completed prior to construction.  Recommendations shall be addressed sufficiently to permit start-up. Chemical specific information is provided in the material safety data sheet (MSDS) kept on site.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nNone\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nIn the event of an emergency, DTI will immediately notify 911 (Washington County OES).  The responders will coordinate emergency response activities.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nUpon commissioning, the terminal shall be integrated into current DTI integrity, safety and environmental management systems and best practices."
