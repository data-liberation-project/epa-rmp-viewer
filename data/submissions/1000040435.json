This program was developed for the management and prevention of risks associated with the receipt, storage and transfer of LPG in its Catano, PR facilities.  The Program was developed to assure that the Tropigas Terminal in Catano is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable regulations of the EPA and the Environmental Quality Board.\n\n\n\nThe Tropigas Terminal in Catano, PR handles a flammable substance, LPG, which is regulated by  EPA, OSHA, PROSHO and the EQB.  Accordingly, the Tropigas Terminal in Catano takes due preacautions in the receipt, storage, transfer and distribution of LPG in order to protect its employees, contractors, visitors and neighboring areas. These safety precautions include procedures and the correct use of equipment to minimize the potential for releases.  We also have an Emergency Response Plan in order to adequately handle any release which may occur. \n\n\n\nIn our Terminal we periodically offer Emergency Response training.  We maintain the tools and repair kits needed to deal with different kinds of situations. Our Emergency Response Plan includes coordination with the local agencies.  Cargoes received fluctuate between 50,000 and 65,000 barrels, which are transferred to 30 storage tanks.  The terminal has a maximum inventory of 2,000,000 gallons.  Tanks fluctuate between 30,000 and 120,000 gallons.\n\n\n\nTropigas Terminal in Catano, PR and its process consist of the following components:            \n\n? Two docks - leased from the Autoridad de Puertos of PR., capable of handling both ships and barges;\n\n? Some 2,500 feet of transfer line (6\" to 8\") from dock to tanks;\n\n? An automatic ethyl mercaptan dosification system (odorizer)\n\n? LPG storage: 30 bullets - 14 of them - 30,000 gals., 2 of them 63,000 gals. and 14 of them 120,000 gals; for a total nominal    \n\n  capacity of 2,226,000 gals. of  L"
