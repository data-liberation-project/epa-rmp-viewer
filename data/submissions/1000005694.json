This facility is known as the Kenton\nPlant and is located on State Route 68 South.  The facility consists of two units that manufacture phenolic resins and molding compounds.  The facility also conducts warehousing and shipping operations to support manufacturing.  The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs approximately 70 full-time employees.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source ( 68.155(a)):\n\nDurez is committed to operating the Kenton facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best management practices.  As part of this commitment Durez has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Kenton facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs (EPA\u00c2\u00bfs) regulation 40CFRpart 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule.  This also provides the public with a description of the risk management program at the Kenton facility.  \n\nThe RMP at the Kenton facility consists of the following three elements:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA hazard assessment program to help understand: (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).

In fact, the Kenton facility has a comprehensive environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nDurez limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at the Kenton facility, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Kenton facility, Durez reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment.  Steps are taken to prevent any such effects through the facility\u00c2\u00bfs Chemical Pre-approval, MOC and PHR procedures, which are followed for all new process or modifications of existing processes.\n \n\nDurez strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.

Industry and government standards are closely  \nFollowed in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed in an MOC or PSSR (for all changes or new systems) before approval. These reviews include HES, engineering, operations, maintenance and management personnel.  In addition, Durez requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees (including call-ins) with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment piping, and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nDurez goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release.  In the event of an accidental release, the Kenton facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Durez utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Durez trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Emergency Response Team which is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental release.  In addition, Durez works with the Kenton City Fire Dept., 911, BKP Ambulance Service, Kenton City Police Dept., and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Durez assisted in helping the LEPC write and implement the Hardin County Emergency Response Plan. \n\nThe Kenton Facility\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of all applicable regulations and Durez policies.

The facility complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations in the loading, unloading, and shipment of materials.\n\nHydrochloric acid is stored in a 7300 gallon storage tank and its contents are directed fed into a resin kettle.   \n\n\n2.1 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in 30 lb cylinders; however, the total quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific - Prevention Steps (68.155(d)):\n\nSince 1994, the Kenton facility has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the facility revised this prevention program to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996,"

(3) operate the processes and (4) help maintain equipment.\n\n3.1.2\tProcess Hazard Review\n\nThe Kenton facility performs and upgrades process hazard reviews (PHRs) once every five years for each covered process.  And, conducted new process hazard analysis for the facility in May 2006. This helps identify process hazards, corrective actions to improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with safety, environmental, engineering, process operation and maintenance experience and a leader with process hazard review experience is assembled to analysis the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the \u00c2\u00bfHAZOP\u00c2\u00bf technique to perform this analysis.  \n\nThe PHR team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3.1.3\tOperating Procedures\n\nKenton facility process engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the plant\u00c2\u00bfs processes and as a training guide. \n\n3.1.4\tTraining\n\nThe Kenton facility trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers: (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can work in the process.  The operators are consulted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from operators are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n3.1.5\tMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Kenton facility maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  The major aspects of the mechanical integrity program include: (1) an inspection and testing program for critical equipment to help identify deterioration and repair items before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment mee"
