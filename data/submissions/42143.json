If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Overbrook Rural fire department, and the Osage Co. LEPC  to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to poeple and the environment.\nThe primary function at this facility is to use agricultural fertilizers for growing crops.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and used as a fertilzier for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored at this location is 78,795 pounds in two storage vessel.\nThe maximum quantity released would be 52,530 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest tank filled to 85% capacity as limited by safety and design standards.  \nTo prevent accidental releases our partners are complying with the Kansas Department of Agriculture rules and regulations.\nThere has not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\nOur facility has a written emergency response plan included with our RMP Compliance Manual.  Additionally, all partners dealing with anhydrous ammonia at our facility have been trained compentent.\nSafety awareness is an ongoing process at our facility.  Maintenance and safety evalulations are performed to assess the facilities condition."
