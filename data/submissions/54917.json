The key elements of the emergency prepareness program are as follows:\n- All plant staff are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n- A team of safety professionals, supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n- The plant uses a combination of audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert staff of a ptential accident and to conduct in-plant comunication.\n- In the event of a large chlorine release, the facility would automatically contact a telephone call-down list that includes City of Carlsbad Fire Department, the County of San Diego's Hazmat Response Team and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. In additon to assisting with the accidental release these agencies will assist in notifying the public and evacuation procedures if needed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVEMENT SAFETY:\n\nA scrubber system has been installed since the last five year update. VWD will continue evaluate safety needs and implement as needed."

      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIBTION:\n\nThe Vallecitos Water District (VWD) uses chlorine at the Meadowlark Water Reclamation Facility for water treatment, for bacterial and viral destruction and odor control, and to control slime and algae growth. Multiple feed points are provided to give flexibility in achieving disinfection goals. Disinfection is achieved by withdrawing gaseous chlorine for 1-ton cylinders, and feeding through chlorinators (with integral vacuum regulators), an automatic switch over assembly, rotameters, and injectors.\n\nNormally, three cylinders resting on the scale feed the system through one of two pipe manifolds. Three other cylinders are on standby and one cylinder is available as a reserve. An underhung bridge crane is used for handling cylinders. \n\nThe feed equipment consist of chlorinators with integral vacuum regulators to meter the gas under vacuum and injectors to create the vacuum and mix the gas with water for transport and application. The system is under vacuum from the injectors to the vacuum regulator at each 1-ton cylinder. From the vacuum regulator to the 1-ton cylinder, the systme is pressurized. Pressurized chlorine piping is minimal.\n\nTwo chlorine leak detectors are provided in the chlorine storage room and one in the chlorination room. In addition to the alarm annunciator and rotating beacons, warning lights are installed near each entry to the chlorination room and chlorine storage room. Also, an automated alarm system and auto-dialing equipment is installed to notify VWD personnel in the event of a leak.\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nVWD uses chlorine at the Meadowlark Water Reclamation Facility in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program. Chlorine is transported to the facility by truck, stored on-site in one-ton cylinders, and used for water disinfection. Typically three 1-ton chlorine cylinders are in use, three are in standby mode and one spare 1-ton cylinder are"

VWD's PSM programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n- Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n- Update standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and ceritified annually.\n- Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n- Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that VWD provides its own employees\n- Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, including documentation of all inspections.\n- Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n- Safety reviews conconducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n- Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n- Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated system.\n- Development of an effective emergency response program.\n- Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM/RMP program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n-Independent audits of the entire PSM/RMP program every three years.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe VWD Meadowlark Water Reclamation Facility has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES:\n\nVWD uses its Emergency Response Plan to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency"
