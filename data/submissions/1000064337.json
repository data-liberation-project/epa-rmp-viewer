The facility is situated in the southern sector of approximately 200 acres of contiguous land. Surrounding property is rural/residential/farmland.  Weylchem has a mature process safety management program in place, designed to minimize and control the potential risks presented by the processes at this site.  Management at the site are committed to ensuring that the facility is operated in a safe manner, protecting the employees, environment and surrounding community.\n\n\n\nReduction in inventory and substitution of RMP chemicals is considered when and where feasible. To this end, bromine inventory is substantially reduced at this time. In addition, one RMP chemical has been added and no RMP chemicals have been eliminated.\n\n\n\nWeylchem utilizes 11 RMP regulated chemicals in quantities above the threshold; bromine, chlorine, ethyl chloride, trichlorosilane, vinyl chloride, propylchloroformate, hydrazine, MonoEthylAmine(100%), MonoMethylAmine(100%),TriMethylAmine, and Anhydrous Hydrochloric Acid. For each of these chemicals measures have been taken to prevent and/or mitigate potential for accidental releases. Efforts for each chemical are detailed below.\n\n\n\nBromine is also used in several processes at Weylchem. All bromine storage tanks, receivers, and pumps are housed in two containment buildings. These vessels are also diked inside the containment buildings, and are equipped with deluge systems for the dikes in the event of a release. Both bromine buildings are vented to emergency scrubbers. In the event of a storage vessel failure and containment of the bromine in a dike, the bromine sensors will immediately activate the emergency scrubbers and safely evacuate the vapor space of the building. The scrubbers can be activated manually or automatically by bromine/chlorine located inside the containment buildings.\n\n\n\nBromine off-gasses from manufacturing processes are v"

Bromine is weighed on a batch basis for individual processes into glass lined receivers. All bromine tanks and receivers are diked and housed in containment buildings.\n\n\n\nMeasures are in place to prevent accidental releases from the bromine tanks and receivers. All storage tanks and receivers are equipped with rupture discs and relief valves. A corrosion resistant rupture disc is installed just above the vessel shell. Above the rupture disc is a pressure relief valve. In the event that over-pressurization bursts the rupture disc, the relief valve would control the release by allowing the overpressure to relieve to the point of the relief valve only. This would minimize the amount of bromine released to the building. The rupture disc protects the relief valve from corrosion. A pressure indicator is installed between the rupture disc and relief valve for protection of rupture disc failure.\n\n\n\nBromine is received on site in tank trailers and off loaded into one of three storage tanks via pressure. The tank truck is parked inside the containment building while unloading. All connections are bolted flanges, and all transfer lines are teflon-lined steel construction. Material handler personnel are present during the entire unloading operation.\n\n\n\nChlorine is currently used in several processes at Weylchem. It is received and used in 1 ton cylinders only. Cylinders are stored inside specially constructed containment buildings equipped with sensors for leak detection. Each chlorine building is equipped with an emergency scrubber capable of safely evacuating the contents of a one a ton cylinder within 45 minutes. Chlorine is vaporized in a unit contained in the buildings and transferred to production equipment as a vapor, which minimizes the quantity of chlorine in the piping.

Chlorine addition is typically interlocked to batch reactor agitation and temperature alarms to prevent transfer when these parameters are out of spec.\n\n\n\nEthyl Chloride is currently used in only one process at this facility. The ethyl chloride is stored in a pressurized storage tank with a nitrogen blanket on the tank. The storage area for ethyl chloride is equipped with a remote activation fixed foam system for fire suppression.\n\n\n\nTrichlorosilane is used in 1 process at the site.

The tube trailer is parked in a building that is vented to an emergency scrubber to allow safe evacuation of the vapor space of the building should a release occur.
