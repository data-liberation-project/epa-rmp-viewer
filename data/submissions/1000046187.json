              "Description": "Approximately 2 or 3 times per year liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank, through a meter and then through a heat exchanger where the liquid anhydrous ammonia is vaporized.  After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0).\n\n\n\nSituated above the holding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pulls air up the tower off of the holding pool.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down packing (i.e., Pall Rings) back down to the holding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaporates and cools the solution.\n\n\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization, flows back to the holding pool and some of the solution flows to a storage tank.\n\n\n\nMears Fertilizer Inc.:\n\n\n\nA mechanical integrity program, written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program are in place for this process.  Additional safeties have been added to the process, such as an audible and visual alarm system which will warn if pump or over-pressurization of equipment occurs.  Fisher N-550 ESV's are installed at discharge of source and at ammonia pump, and pneumatically held open during use, are capable of remote closure.  The ammonia hose used between source and pump, as well as that used for bypass, is FMI-22 double-braided, corrugated 316L SS to avoid potential rupture between these critical connections.  A standard Fisher pressure regulator is used at the pump, pressure controlled, to bypass any excess ammonia to the suction side of the pump.  A standard ammonia backcheck valve is used on the input line at the Mix Unit to prevent ammonia loss in case of hose rupture.  Pressure relief valves for the ammonia system are recertified annually by an outside vendor.  These added safeties have proven effective in avoiding potential releases as evidenced by MFI's safety record.",

Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers used for crop production nutrients.  The facility maintains approximately fifty-six (56) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for customer use.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the nurse tanks is approximately 261,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the stationary tanks at the facility is approximately 317,000 pounds stored in one (1) 26,000 gallon storage tank, one (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank and two (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  This facility is loaded strictly by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility would be approximately 578,000 pounds.  This would occur wh"

The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n\n\n4) Training:  All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. Upon request, training records can be produced for United Farmers Coop employees and a letter from the contractor hired to mix 10-34-0 stating what their employees have been trained on and that the training is current.  The contractor will also advise how to access specific training documentation if required.\n\n\n\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\n \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
