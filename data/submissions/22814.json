ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nManagement of the Gold Kist Northeast Alabama Division processing plant in Boaz (GK-Boaz) is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental protection.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which includes equipment design and installation, operating and maintenance procedures and employee training.  Our employees implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, trained emergency response personnel are present to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We also coordinate with the Boaz Fire Department for additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATE SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nGK-Boaz is a poultry processing plant which uses one regulated substance, ammonia, in its operations.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to ensure wholesome products.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nIn evaluating worst case and alternative release scenarios, look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia refrigeration system.  The scenario involves the release of ammonia in a gaseous form from the largest vessel over a ten-minute period.  The release is modeled under worst case meterological conditions, has a maximum endpoint of 1.6 miles and could have off-site impacts.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from the ammonia ref"

Under neutral weather conditions, this release scenario has a maximum distance to endpoint of 0.10 miles and could have off-site impacts.\n\n4.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe GK-Boaz facility is in compliance with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The refrigeration system is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary sources.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nDetailed records of safety information which describes chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all operations are maintained at the facility.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nPersonnel with engineering and processing expertise conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our operations are identified and controlled efficiently.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The methodology used to perform these analyses is the What If/Checklist method.  The studies are validated every five years.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nWritten operation procedures are in place to ensure safe plant operations.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a planned shutdown.  The procedures are reviewed regularly and are readily accessible to employees involved in the operations.\n\nTRAINING\nA comprehensive training program ensures that employees are competent in the operation procedures associated with their jobs.

Equipment examined includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Equipmetn deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Plant maintenance is performed by qualified, trained personnel who are provided specialized training as needed.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipmetn and procedures.  Equipment operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose jobs are affected by plant modifications are notified and trained.\n\nPRE-STARTUP\nPre-startup safety reviews of new processes and modifications of established processes are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nRegular audits are conducted every three years to determine compliance with the provisions of th eRMP and PSM regulations.  Any corrective actions needed are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nAny incident that results in or could result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance is investigated to identify the situation leading to the incident and corrective actions needed to prevent the incident from occurring in the future.  Reports of the investigation are retained for five years.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nPlant safety and accident prevention are team efforts.  Company employees are encouraged to express their veiws concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including process hazard analysis.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nOn occasion,"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nGK-Boaz has had no recordable release of regulated substances during the past five years.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nA written emergency response plan is in place to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This plan includes first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, the post-incident decontamination.  The plan is updated as needed to reflect changes in operations.  All emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to ensure proper operation.\n\n7.
