The anniversary date of the most recent resubmission of the RMP was July 31, 2017, and this resubmission is being submitted to update information related to activities at the plant since the last resubmission. The last resubmission was the 5-year update to the initial RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nBonanza has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nBonanza has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nBonanza's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Bonanza is Jeff Gilbert, Plant Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individual (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) assists the Plant Manager with RMP and spill response coordination:\n\n\n\nDustin Hunt, EHS Manager\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nWork: 620.276.4749\n\n24-Hour: 620.482.0089\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe Bonanza ethanol plant is located in Garden City, Finney County, Kansas. The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week to manufacture fuel-grade or industrial ethanol from corn. The regulated substance under the RMP program is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results yielded a 0.8 mile radius, and is provided as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. A ditch is located to the east of the facility. This ditch flows southeast toward the Garden City Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is within the worst-case distance to endpoint for denaturant. The water will eventually reach the Arkansas River, which is also within the worst-case distance to endpoint.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\n\n\n1. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spil"

      "SummaryText": "l, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1.0 pounds per square inch (psi), a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility only occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member in the control room overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end-point; the model results were <0.1 miles, and the model output is also included as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. The population was estimated using a 0.2 mile distance to endpoint as CAPS did not have data for a 0.1 mile radius. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe Bonanza facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the presence of the flammable mixture that is covered by the Process Safety Management requirements.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nBonanza's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are conducted and monthly leak detection monitoring is performed, with associated reports filed per KDHE and/"
