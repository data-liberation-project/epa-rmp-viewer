Park Street, Blackburn, MO. 65321\nContact: \tKen Catlett\nPhone: \t660-538-4611\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n\tCentral Missouri AGRIService, LLC., and its employees in Blackburn are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Blackburn Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid/dry fertilizer products, anhydrous ammonia and agricultural chemicals.\n\n\tAnhydrous ammonia is stored for distribution to local farmers who apply it directly to the soil as a crop nutrient. The anhydrous ammonia is also used in blending liquid fertilizer. The largest quantity stored in a fixed tank would be 140,000 pounds in the 30,000 gallon tank located near main street. A smaller tank is located at the northwest corner of the property and can contain 12,000 gallon. The largest storage tank used in this plan is a railroad tankcar which would hold 160,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the railcar as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of the vapor cloud (200 ppm) is 2.7 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. This release is assumed controlled by automatic shut-off\u00bfs or manual intervention in 2 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint of the vap"

The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 1910.111, and ANSI standard K61, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. \n\nThere are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
