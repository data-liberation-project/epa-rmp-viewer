      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nKinder Morgan Production Company, LLC (Kinder Morgan) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Kinder Morgan's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to effectively control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Yates Gas Plant (YGP) in the Yates Field Unit, located near Iraan, Texas, extracts natural-gas liquids from natural gas and manufactures sweet fuel gas for plant and field consumption.  The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68. \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe  worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances does not impact off-site receptors.  RMP*comp was used to determine the distance to endpoint.  Although there are numerous controls at the YGP to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst-case scenario.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule, OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.   Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  The facility has safety featur"

Some examples of these safety features include: fixed hydrogen-sulfide monitors with alarms, automatic shutdown systems, a secondary power source, a plant firewater system, and dikes to contain liquid releases.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances with off-site impacts in the past five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\nKinder Morgan has developed and implemented a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance potentially resulting from a fire or explosion, severe weather, environmental spill, or pipeline failure.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident cleanup, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modifications made to the plant process or operating procedures, or a change in the communication procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program is coordinated with the local emergency response and government officials.  The facility has round-the-clock communication capability with appropriate local emergency planning committee (LEPC) officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to meetings with the LEPC, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local community and emergency response org"
