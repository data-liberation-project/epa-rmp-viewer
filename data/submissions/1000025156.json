Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT - A compliance audit is conducted at least every 3 years to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.

Five year accident history\r\n\r\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks.  When practical, the response team at Harcros - Nashville will be assisted by the more experienced response teams from other Harcros facilities, particularly the Muscle Shoals facility. We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\r\n\r\nOur response program is for chlorine leaks only.  We will not respond to other types of emergencies but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nHarcros has operated this distribution facility since 1969 and previously stored chlorine containers until the mid-1990's.  We are storing chlorine again at this facility to better serve existing and new customers in the greater Nashville area.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nThis distribution facility will be storing chlorine cylinders and ton container, which are considered hazardous.  The same properties that make chlorine a valuable commodity chemical also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine containers, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel. This facility stores other hazardous chemicals also.  Similar precautions are used with those chemicals but chlorine is the only chemical covered by the RMP regulation that will be stored above threshold amounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nOne of the purposes of this facility will be to store chlorine for distribution to our customers, which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers, and are shipped to our customers in the same packages.  Chlorine will not be used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The storage of chlorine at this site is subject to RMP Program Level 2.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

In addition, this facility has current copies of all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.\r\n\r\nHAZARD REVIEW - A hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine container storage before they are brought on site.  This hazard review will be repeated at least every 5 years.  We primarily use a checklist prepared by the Chlorine Institute, which is relevant to our operations.  At least one hourly employee (warehouse personnel or driver) takes part in this review.  Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these reviews are documented and addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - We have Standard Operating Procedures covering all aspects of storage and movement of containers.\r\n\r\nTRAINING - All new drivers and warehouse personnel attend a 5 or 3 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that store chlorine receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to that chemical.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE - Container storage is the only process for RMP chemicals at this facility.  We perform a visual inspection of containers when received and before loading for delivery to customers.  In addition, we perform daily inspections and routine maintenance on the forklift trucks used to move containers.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION - We have an Incident Investigation SOP, which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as near-misses that could have lead to injuries and releases.
