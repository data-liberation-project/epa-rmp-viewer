      "SummaryText": "Process:\n\n This Facility is a food processing plant that runs continuously. The regulated substances under the RMP\nrule are anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) and propane (CAS #74-98-6). Ammonia is used as a primary refrigerant for cooling purposes in both production and storage areas. There are two separate refrigeration systems on site operating independent of one another. Both systems are a closed loop with normal operating  pressures of less than 200 PSI. The main plant system (process) has a maximum charge of 19,000 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The Hassia system (process) has a maximum charge of 14,050 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The remaining 1,450 lbs, are stored outdoors in ten 145 lb D.O.T. certified blue cylinders.  Propane is used for fuel for industrial lift trucks and as an alternative fuel in the event that the plant (Hunt Wesson) is curtailed by Northern States Power Company due to severe cold weather, fuel shortages or line work. The propane storage vessel is outdoors at ambient temperature.\n\nQuantity:\n\nMaximum quantities on-site for each regulated substance are\nAmmonia (Anhydrous)-34,500 lbs.\nPropane-110,000 lbs.\n\nWorst-case scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe worst-case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPAs \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" Reference tables or equations. This scenario was based on the following criteria.\n\nVessel:                                   High Pressure Receiver (HPR) 3ft X 17.5 ft.\nAmount released:                    5,000 lbs\nDuration of release:                10 minutes\nRelease rate:                          500 lbs/ min\nWind speed:                            1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric stability:              F\nTopography:                            Urban\n\nReferencing the tables in the \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.90 miles. Within the affected area is a population of 2,638 people, one school, two recreational areas, commerci"

The population within this area is 40 people.  Also affected are several businesses and residences.  Although considered a more likely scenario, there are many safeguards that are in place, at this facility to minimize the occurrence of such a release (see General Accidental Release Prevention Program of this Summary).\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Policies:\n\nHunt Wesson Inc. has established an in-house level A emergency response \"HAZMAT\" team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 \"HAZWOPER\".  The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency.
