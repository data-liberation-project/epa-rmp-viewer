EPA's RMP*COMP version 1.07 was used to determine the maximum downwind distance the ammonia release could impact the general public.\nThis assessment incorporated a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (Ammonia concentration) of 0.14 mg/L. This toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L refers to the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted. The alternate case chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 96,000 pounds would be released over a 2-minute period. A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards have been installed and operator intervention will tend to mitigate and limit the quantity in such cases. The same modeling techniques were applied and resulted in much lesser off-site impact. Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release will cause off-site impacts. The EPA\u2019s RMP*COMP version 1.07 was also used to perform the off-site consequence analysis. The ammonia toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L was used in the assessment.\nBlack Point Personnel are committed to implementing, reviewing, and updating the facility's Process Safety Management Program to ensure the highest standards are met for the continued safe operation of the Ammonia Terminal.

Findings of the investigation team and their recommendations for corrective action are documented, as is the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT: \nThe program is audited at least every three years to verify compliance with these procedures. Findings of the audit are documented, and any deficiencies are corrected and documented. \n\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the 5-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or any known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no reportable releases in the facility's last five years. However, a nonreportable release was recorded on July 2, 2013, for which a notification was submitted to the National Response Center, case number 701976. This release was less than 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\nHAZMAT training is performed in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and pre-emergency planning and drills are conducted with local emergency responders. The emergency response program complies with the OSHA PSM Program as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances. The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site. This is called the worst case toxic release"

By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, and maintain a safe and healthy workplace.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCEAND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\nThe Black Point Ammonia Terminal serves as a vital link in supplying ammonia to its own manufacturing facilities and other customers. Black Point receives refrigerated anhydrous ammonia from ships at its unloading dock. Ammonia is pumped from the ship to low pressure storage tanks where the ammonia is refrigerated and stored at -28 \u00b0F. Black Point may also transfer ammonia via a privately owned pipeline for delivery to Mosaic facilities. The only substance regulated under EPA's RMP requirements at the facility is ammonia.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nBlack Point has an extensive safety program to ensure compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations. The facility operates under a Corporate Environmental Health and Safety Policy that endorses going beyond regulatory requirements when necessary to protect the health and safety of its employees and the public. The design, maintenance and operation of the facility are carried out in conformance with this policy to provide a safe operation and to prevent exposures of our employees and nearby neighbors to ammonia. Management at the Black Point Ammonia Terminal is responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy. The programs and procedures are continually reviewed and updated.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                     \nThe Black Point Terminal has always had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect, and all its employees are trained to the extent of F"

In this Tampa Port Services distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our employees and site workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations, and we are committed to conducting business and operating our facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment, and the health and safety of our employees, and our neighbors around the Ammonia Terminal. The facility is situated on Port Sutton Channel, with dock facilities for one ship, and storage tanks with the capacity for up to 49,000 tons of ammonia. The ammonia is in liquid form and is maintained at low temperature (-28\u00b0 F) to keep the storage tank pressure below one pound per square inch.\n\nPOLLUTION PREVENTION POLICY:\nTampa Port Services, LLC, is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations. We strive to eliminate or reduce our use of toxic substances and to minimize our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.
