      "SummaryText": "This initial RMP submittal is for the Aldi, Inc. (Aldi) facility located on State Route 281 south of the village of Tully, NY.  This facility is a warehouse and storage/trans-shipment point for grocery items destined for retail sale at Aldi stores in the vicinity.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system.  Due to plant expansion, the system capacity is being increased, with the result that total ammonia capacity will increase to approximately 13,000 pounds beginning in April 2007.\n\nThe Aldi facility has one covered process, the ammonia refrigeration system.  Because the release of ammonia has the potential to impact offsite receptors, and because ammonia is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR ?1910.119, the process has been determined to be a ?Program Level 3? process.  The basic process safety management program elements for a Program 3 process are covered in detail in the ?Aldi Foods Process Safety Management Program? and are briefly summarized in Section 3 of this document.  The facility underwent a comprehensive PSM program review, including a Process Hazard Analysis, in December of 2006.  Minor recommendations from the PSA have been implemented prior to the completion of process modifications.\n\nIn addition to the PSM elements, the RMP regulations require that subject facilities evaluate the consequences of off-site releases.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) must include at least one worst-case release scenario and at least one alternative (more likely) release scenario.  The scenarios used in Aldi?s consequence assessment were selected from a review of the process hazard analysis conducted in December of 2006, and endpoints and impacts estimated using the techniques from EPA's \"Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\".\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related accidents occurring over the last 5 years (in fact,no such accidents have occurred at this site).  \n\nIn addition "

      "SummaryText": "to its Risk Management and Process Safety Management program documentation, Aldi maintains a comprehensive safety program that includes emergency procedures in the event of an ammonia release (evacuation, notification, response, local agency coordination, and communication).  Aldi coordinates closely with the Onondaga County HAZMAT Team and the Tully Fire Department, as well as its local refrigeration service provider (Mullally Bros.) and equipment supplier (Frick).  Site personnel have been trained in proper refrigeration system management and have participated in process hazard reviews.  Aldi is committed to operating its facility in a safe manner at all times."
