AFCO is a full-service partner through\u00acout all areas of the client facilities and their process management. Working alongside our clients AFCO delivers expertise and hands-on support to help meet sanitation, compliance and operational needs efficiently and cost-effectively.\r\nThe 408,000 square foot GDC facility serves as a holding and distribution warehouse for factory packaged household, commercial and industrial chemicals.  Products include sanitation and maintenance products like detergents, hand care, degreasers, deodorants, lubricants and pest control solutions.  AFCO provides a full range of services connected with our products, including consultation, training, equipment designed to deliver our products, and customer site service. \r\n\r\nThe warehouse has been constructed with 6 separate fire rated areas.  Early Suppression Fast Response (ESFR) sprinklers have been installed within 12 inches of the exterior wall on the east and west sides of the building.  In rack sprinklers have been installed in each of the four tiers of the aerosol and flammable storage racks.  The building is 100% sprinkled.  Fire protection valves are electronically supervised with a central station signaling system.  Separate storage areas have been constructed with fire rated walls, 3-hour fire rated automatically closing fire doors.  Fire department is within one mile of facility.  The warehouse has contracted security  services, access control system, cameras, fencing, intrusion detection, perimeter lighting and physical barriers.\r\n\r\nProducts are received by truck at numerous docks along the east side of the building.

Flammable liquids are stored in either Flammable Room #1 or #2. Corrosive products are stored in the cutoff Corrosive Products storage rooms.  As needed, products are pulled and staged at docks along east side of the building for shipping to end users.  Cross docking is conducted where products are received from one carrier, staged at the loading docks and shipped out as partial loads the same day.\r\n\r\nThe peracetic acid products are received and stored in various containers, including 330-gallon totes, 55 gallon drums, and smaller (1-5 gallon) containers.  The warehouse section of the facility stores and ships these products to customers.  The GDC site does not repack peracetic acid products from larger to smaller containers.  \r\n\r\nBased on the materials handled, and offsite consequence analysis, the GDC facility consists of two processes - peracetic acid handling is characterized as Program Level 2, while aerosol handling is characterized as Program Level 1.\r\n\r\nAFCO implements an accidental release prevention policy for peracetic acid handling to ensure compliance with the EPA RMP regulation.  The accidental release prevention program includes:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information, which includes:\r\no\tSDS sheets for products containing peracetic acid, \r\no\tsafety information for the peracetic acid products \r\no\tinventory which is an ongoing update of quantities products containing peracetic acid on hand; \r\no\twarehouse layout \r\no\tdesign codes and standards utilized in construction and project engineering,\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)/Risk Assessment, this includes a process hazard analysis for peracetic acid product storage and handling.
