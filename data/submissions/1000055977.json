This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and incorporating safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the Longview facility's processes. The Longview facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility personnel have been trained on how to respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAmerican Midstream's facility, located near Longview, Texas, operates two processes covered by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation and Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. The facility's oldest covered process utilizes a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, ethane, propane, butane) from natural gas. The Natural Gas process contains several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, propane and butane. The facility's newest process, the Rail Terminal, is utilized to receive, store, and transport Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Stabilized Gasoline. The Rail Terminal process contains two regulated mixtures, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Stabilized Gasoline. \n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is an executive summary of the two accidental release prevention programs in place at the Longview facility. This summary includes a brief description of each process's (Natural Gas and Rail Terminal)accidental release prevention program, including the management systems used to facilitate each.\n\n \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Longview facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety manag"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees are given access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program that applies to the process in which they work. The specific ways that employees can be involved in each accident prevention program is documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained for each process. \n\n \n\n Process Safety Information\n\n \n\nThe Longview facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain the safe operation of the Natural Gas and Rail Terminal processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.    \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  Specific safety-related process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) have been documented in each process' Standard Operating Procedures Manual. Each process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Longview facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing in"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n \n\nThe Longview facility primarily uses the checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. Checklist analysis, when performed by trained and knowledgeable personnel, is recognized by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique. Each analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. Each team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and accident prevention and mitigation measures. Each team then makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures whenever the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nEach PHA team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from their original design features, the Longview facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results for each of its covered processes. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be cond"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Longview facility maintains written operating procedures for each of its covered processes that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and the basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed for completeness and accuracy.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.   \n\nIn addition, each process' Standard Operating Procedures Manual also contains information pertaining to the consequences of process deviations, which provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances of process parameters.  Each manual is kept readily accessible to process operators. \n\n \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures developed for each process, the Longview facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive training on their process' basic operations, if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, each new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they have knowledge necessary to perform their duties and tasks in a safe manner, they are authorized to work independently. In addition, all operators will be periodically re-certif"

All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify understanding.\n\n \n\nContractors\n\nThe Longview facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Due to the fact that some contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the Longview facility has put procedures in place to ensure that contractors:   (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what to do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Longview personnel of any hazards they find. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work.  In addition, the Longview facility also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of each contractor to ensure that contractors are able to fulfill their safety obligations.\n\n \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Longview facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review verifies construction is in accordance with design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready. During each PSSR, personnel use checklists to verify all aspects of readiness and verify all accident prevention program requirements have been properly implemented.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Longview facility has established practices"

The basic aspects of the facility's mechanical integrity program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. \n\nMaintenance personnel at the Longview facility receive training on (1) an overview of covered processes, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices in order to ensure they're able to safely perform their jobs. \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees are instructed to correct the deficiency before placing it back into service (if possible). If the employee is unable to correct the deficiency the management of change team will determine which actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\n \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Longview facility has previously implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel receive training on relevant changes, when necessary. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Longview facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the management personnel for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked to completion.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility also developed procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment. \n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The facility's emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to either of the Longview facility's covered processes. All changes to the emergency response program are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Longview Gas Plant is coordinated with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Longview facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n\n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Longview Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process."
