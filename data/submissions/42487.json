(Kraft) facility in Springfield, Missouri has a good record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The Kraft facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented the SAP electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Kraft facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per wee"

      "SummaryText": "k.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Springfield Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAt this location Kraft manufactures and produces dairy products.  The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is 311514.  This facility is capable of producing various dairy products including cheese for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products.  Some of these areas include coolers, chillers, storage tanks, and some processes.  The plant also produces some pasta products  \n\nKraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 152,000 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Kraft plant in Springfield, MO.\n\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nKraft has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At Kraft, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.  The Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n2.  The plant mainta"

An electronic control monitoring system and emergency shut down system is in place for the entire engine room process.\n\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of the facility?s accident history includes the following range of dates: February 1, 2000 ? February 1, 2005 . According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are nine in-plant contacts for an emergency, a list of these contacts can be found in the Emergency Response Plan (SPCC).  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency.  Response team members participate in a mock spill cleanup annually.  All trained ER team members have pagers/phones that can be activated.\n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Springfield Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment.  The Springfield Fire Department will also be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where an ambulance is called, the fire department is also called to the scene. \n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished.  The ?What-If? method is used for each component of the ammonia system.  There are numerous examples of safety improvements as a result of the PSA results.  These improvemen"

Q1). \nAnalysis:  The area around the ammonia receiver and condensers routinely has fork truck traffic en route to the back ammonia compressor room dock.  Consequently all ammonia system components in this area are at risk of damage resulting in an ammonia release.\nCorrective action:  A chain link fence was installed around the perimeter of the ammonia receiver and condenser area.  No vehicle traffic of any kind is permitted and the area was secured with a ?one-way? turnstile gate.  This was completed in January of 2002.\n\nRecommendation #2:  Install quick connect valves on all ammonia compressor thermosyphon heat exchangers to expedite system pump down in the event of an ammonia release from a flange (ref. Q4).\nAnalysis:  A ?quick connection? type valve is not designed to be a safe application for extremely hazardous materials such as ammonia refrigerant.  The thermosyphon heat exchangers are equipped with accessible isolation valves and evacuation valves with a screwed and capped outlet connection.\nCorrective action:  None\n\nRecommendation #3:  Discontinue purchasing/installing inferior ?aftermarket? mechanical seals for ammonia screw compressors to reduce the frequency of seal failure and subsequent ammonia release (ref. Q5).\nAnalysis:  Purchase history of mechanical seals supports recommendation.\nCorrective action:  Purchase of all ammonia screw compressor mechanical seals from OEM (FES) supplier effective in July of 2000 (exact date unknown).\n\nRecommendation #4:  Install a lock on ammonia receiver ?fill? valve so that Ammonia Operator on duty can inspect bulk vendor equipment prior to unloading (ref. Q7).\nAnalysis:  An excellent recommendation, both for the reason stated as well as for the security of the ammonia system.\nCorrective action:  A lock was installed on the ammonia receiver ?fill valve? in July of 2000 (exact date unknown).\n\nRecommendat"

The surge room would not be involved in this scenario; however, question #11 could apply to this recommendation.  Exhaust fan was checked and found to have ?loose? belts.  The existing alarm system is audible and the area is normally occupied.  The existing alarm system also automatically starts the exhaust system when an ammonia level of 75 ppm is reached.  The installation of detectors (connected to the central control system) in all cooler/chiller areas is preferable but not critical to ammonia safety of the plant refrigeration system as these areas are typically staffed 6/7 days/week and 24 hours/day.\nCorrective Action:  1. Tighten belts on New Slice exhaust fan.  2. Future ammonia system (new construction projects and major repairs) will include ammonia detectors connected to the central control system.\n\nRecommendation #6:  Hook up New Slice surge drum liquid level alarms to Cantley system and interlocked the refrigeration system with the product pump (ref. Q9).\nAnalysis:  The scenario questioned (Q9) would not result in an ?unsafe? condition.\nCorrective action:  None\n\nRecommendation #7:  This recommendation is identical to recommendation #6 and applies to the Old Slice surge drums (ref.

This was a good recommendation and plans have already been made to remove both the link and glass line chillers as part of a new process installation.\nCorrective action:  The link and glass line chillers and controls were removed from service in November 2002.\n\nRecommendation #15:  Install an ammonia detector in the Cream Cheese cooler and connect to the Cantley system (CAMS) (ref .Q24).\nAnalysis:  The installation of ammonia detectors (connected to the central control system) in all cooler/chiller areas is preferable but not critical to ammonia safety of the plant refrigeration system as these areas are typically staffed 6/7 days/week and 24 hours/day.  The eventual installation of ammonia detectors (connected to the central control system) in all cooler/chiller areas is preferable and would provide early warning when personnel are not in the area.\nCorrective action:  Future ammonia system (new construction projects and major repairs) will include ammonia detectors connected to the central control system.\n\nRecommendation #16:  Install catwalks around milk tanks to access refrigeration controls (ref. Q28).\nAnalysis:  Catwalks would provide safer access to relief valve switching stations.\nCorrective action:  Preliminary engineering funding was requested and granted in 2002 for the 2003 budget.  Structural engineering was completed in 2003 and funding for platform installation was requested and granted in 2003 for the 2004 budget.  PEM CAR was submitted for final approval in March 2004.  Installation is planned for July/August 2004.\n\nRecommendation #17:  Check all milk tanks to verify they are equipped with reseating relief valves to suction and relief vent pipes a"

      "SummaryText": "re located where they will not discharge over relief switching valve (ref. Q29).\nAnalysis:  Kraft ammonia piping specifications do not require reseating relief valves back to suction; however, reseating relief valves will minimize the amount of ammonia released to the atmosphere when an ?over pressure? condition occurs.\nCorrective action:  On new construction and major repairs, Kraft in Springfield has standardized the practice of installing reseating relief valves back to suction.\n\nRecommendation #18:  Install an ammonia detector in the Milk Receiving Tank Room and connect the alarm to the central control system (ref. Q30).\nAnalysis:  The installation of ammonia detectors (connected to the central control system) in all cooler/chiller areas is preferable but not critical to ammonia safety of the plant refrigeration system as these areas are typically staffed 6/7 days/week and 24 hours/day.  The eventual installation of ammonia detectors (connected to the central control system) in all cooler/chiller areas is preferable and would provide early warning when personnel are not in the area.\nCorrective action:  Future ammonia system (new construction projects and major repairs) will include ammonia detectors connected to the central control system.\n\nRecommendations #19, #20, and #21:  Install high-level ammonia liquid alarms, water temperature probes, and oil pots on facility ice builders (ref. Q32, Q33, Q34).\nAnalysis:  The scenarios referenced in Questions 32, 33, and 34 do not represent any potential safety hazard.\nCorrective action:  None"
