Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Osage Cooperative in Osage, IA are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We also coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Osage Community Fire Department, which provides emergency response\n\nexpertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in a 15,000-gallon tank, a 30,000-gallon tank, as well as several nurse tanks at our\n\nfacility in Osage, IA (Figure 1).  The standard maximum possible amount of ammonia stored at this\n\nfacility at 85% is 498,197 lbs which would include the maximum storage capacity of all nurse tanks\n\nand the two large fixed tanks.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \n\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\n\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \n\nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, "

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of\n\ncircle. 2 miles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 950 people within 2 mile radius of the site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of\n\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.
