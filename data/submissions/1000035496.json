Proactively reduce occupational injury and illness risks\n\n? Meet or exceed applicable legal requirements\n\n? Aggressively pursue pollution prevention, energy conservation and waste reduction in our operations\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility/Process Description\n\n\n\nAutomobile seat cushions are manufactured at the facility using molded polyurethane foam.  The seat cushions are manufactured on a single processing line using  molded two-component polyurethane foam.  The two (2) components will be a blend of polyol and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) mixed in controlled proportions to react, expand to fill molds and cure into rigid foam cushions.  The polyol and TDI is extruded from robotic applicator(s) into cushion molds and immediately begins to expand.  The molds are automatically closed to contain the expanding foam.  The polyurethane foam is allowed to cure in the closed molds while carriers continue along an oval conveyor track.  When the polyurethane foam has cured, the molds are opened and cushions removed at manual work stations.  Cushions are placed on a separate conveyor, trimmed of excess foam, inspected for imperfections and repaired as necessary prior to packaging and shipment off-site as finished product.  Empty molds are re-used. \n\n\n\nProduction materials including TDI are delivered and stored at the facility in bulk containers. All containers will be stored insid"

      "SummaryText": "e the manufacturing building for temperature control.  TDI is delivered by tanker truck and stored in a single vertical cylindrical tank capable of holding up to 10,000 gallons.  Unloading of the tanker trucks occurs inside the building.  The TDI is pumped from the 10,000 gallon storage tank to a smaller day-tank for use in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\n\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in two forms (2,4-Toluene Diisocyanate & 2,6-Toluene Diisocyanate) is used in a single material used as the expanding agent in polyurethane foam manufacturing at the facility.  TDI is a colorless to light yellow liquid with a strong pungent odor and can be harmful if inhaled. Eye and skin irritation can result from contact. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTDI is a liquid under normal operating conditions.  If spills should occur, TDI will flow and pool as would be expected with liquid water.  Consequently, impervious barriers (concrete floors and curbs) are used to contain potential TDI spillage.  Tanker trucks are unloaded inside the main manufacturing building within a curbed concrete off-loading structure capable of containing greater than 100% of the tanker truck contents.  The TDI storage tank is located inside the main manufacturing building within a concrete diked area capable of containing greater than 100% of the tank contents.  Alarms and shut-off valves are utilized to prevent storage tank over-filling.\n\n\n\nOverhead piping is used to distribute the TDI from the storage tank to the mold application area.  The overhead TDI pipes are labeled and observed daily for any signs of leaking or spillage.  In addition, ambient air monitoring is performed continuously to detect the potential presence of TDI in the building air.  Audio and visual alarms signal the presence of TDI at a fraction of the OSHA exposure threshold.  Preventive maintenance practices are implemented to assure all equipment is operating properly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident His"

      "SummaryText": "tory\n\n\n\nNo release of TDI has occurred within the past five-years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Program consistent with OSHA chemical safety requirements contained in the HAZWOPER program.  A trained HAZWOPER team is on-site during operational periods to respond to potential TDI spill incidents.  Release events that are too large to be handled by the internal team are to be handled by local emergency responders. IMA has made a significant effort to communicate the elements of its response program with local emergency responders. Members of the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Commission have been invited to visit the facility. Facility personnel involved with the TDI process receive regular training on pollution prevention and emergency response. This training includes participating in an emergency drill which is documented. Alert systems are also in place at the facility.  As previously described the facility is equipped with TDI air monitoring devices to provide early warning of a TDI release.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEmergency response procedures and other safety related practices related to TDI handling and processing are reviewed on at least an annual basis and updated as needed.  Currently, there are no significant safety improvement changes planned."
