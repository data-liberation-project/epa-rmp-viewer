      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  Univar supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil & gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome products stored and handled by Univar are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1.  Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA'S Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program.  Univar has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual and RMP Compliance Manual.  Briefly, these programs includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazards Analysis\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Management of Change\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Hot Work Permits\n?    Contractors\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in-place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to Univar facility personnel.  Univar responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nUnivar invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with our"

      "SummaryText": " products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Cincinnati Ohio site manufacturers, stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers and municipalities in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia.  We have four substances at our facility in quantities above the RMP planning thresholds.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Ammonia (anhydrous), and ammonia water solutions.  The typical inventory levels for these chemicals are:\n\n?    Chlorine Transfer - 370,000 lbs in railcars, \n?    Chlorine Storage - 1,965,000 lbs in railcars and 150# and ton cylinders,\n?    Sulfur dioxide - 155,000 lbs in 150# and ton cylinders,\n?    Ammonia (anhydrous) - 421,000 lbs in tanks, railcars and 150# cylinders,\n?    Ammonia water solutions (>20%) - 337,000 lbs in tanks, trucks, drums and intermediate bulk containers,\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario for the site would involve a catastrophic railcar failure with the release of 90 tons of chlorine, according to the EPA proscribed release protocol.  This would result in a release of 180,000 lbs of chlorine in a 10 minute time period.  The toxic liquid is assumed to form a pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  USEPA's RMP COMP, Version 1.07 air dispersion model projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 14 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFour alternative release scenarios were developed for the site using EPA proscribed protocol and conducting air dispersion modeling with RMP COMP, Version 1.07:\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for chlorine would involve a liquid valve on a ton cylinder failure releasing 200 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide would involve a liquid valve on a ton cyli"

Alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would involve a 1? line break during railcar unloading releasing 6000 lbs for 30 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for 30% ammonia water solutions would involve a transfer hose rupture resulting in release of 11,500 lbs of material for a 10-minute period.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Univar USA Inc. is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and utilizes this program to meet the prevention program requirements under RMP.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the following:\n1. The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2.  Employee training and operating procedures.\n3.  Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4.  Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines.\n5.  Chlorine and ammonia area detectors.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases from this site has been reduced to a minimum.  The Cincinnati site has experienced only two accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the transfer of chlorine in the previous 5 years.  During a 1999 incident, approximately 3 lbs of chlorine were released from a pipe gasket.  No injuries or offsite impacts occurred.  During a 2003 incident, an estimated 2000 lbs of chlorine were released from a process storage tank.  No injuries or offsite impacts occurred.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Univar Cincinnati site has a written Contingency Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacu"

The site can utilize local emergency response contractors to provide onsite and offsite emergency response services in the event of a release.  The local Union Township Fire Department is familiar with and periodically visits the site.  Butler County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Contingency Plan has been coordinated."
