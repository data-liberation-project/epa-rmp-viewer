Is fully committed to providing a safer more healthful workplace for all employees and surrounding community.   The main objective of our safety program is to prevent an unwanted release of ammonia into locations that could expose employees and others to this serious hazard.  Our approach is based on a systematic evaluation of the entire refrigeration process, training employees on ammonia safety and standard operating procedures.  Merchandise Warehouse is committed to providing safety programs that insure the integrity of our equipment including the design of the system, management of change, routine inspection and incident investigation.  Our quality systems insure continuous improvement through preventive/correction actions.\n\n\n\nSenior management commitment of ammonia safety is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Preventive Action \n\na. Preventive maintenance on refrigeration equipment up to date.\n\nb. Timely maintenance on repair/replacement items.\n\n\n\n2. Education\n\na. Safety drills including employees and contractors.\n\nb. Meeting with employees with sign off.\n\n\n\n3. Continuous improvement.\n\na. As regulations change.\n\nb. As the  infrastructure changes\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property da"

      "SummaryText": "mage.\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  Anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) is the only toxic substance on location that requires OSHA and EPA reporting requirements.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program. \n\n\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. Through the use of multiple stages of compression, the refrigeration system provides the systems required refrigeration operating temperatures of +20F and +35F. \n\n\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to atmosphere. Normal system safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, ammonia detection and ventilating systems for the machine room areas.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Action Plan. This facility will call local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the LEPC for Marion County."

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMerchandise Warehouse currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards. The most recent Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in July 2012.  All recommendations resulting from this analysis will be evaluated and implemented as required to provide a safer system.\n\n\n\n"
