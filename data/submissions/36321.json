      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN ? Overhill Farms, Inc.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOverhill Farms has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the Refrigeration System at its Vernon facility to enhance its already existing safety programs.  Overhill Farms is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  Overhill Farms staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The Refrigeration System, that contains the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, is used for freezer operation and chilling water.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOverhill Farms has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include a discussion of the overall approach elected by Overhill Farms for implementation at the facility, key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, threats and civil disorder, earthquake, potential imminent danger to personnel, chemical spill, and ammonia health hazards \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Refrigeration System at the Overhill Farms is a two-stage system comprised of compressors, evaporative condensers, a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, a glycol heater, two water chillers, an intercooler, a thermosyphon vessel, a recirculator, and an accumulator.  \n\nThe Refrigeration System at Overhill Farms provides the cooling medium for several spiral freezers, holding freezers, a 34?F Cooler, shipping and receiving docks, one glycol heater and two water chillers.  The Refrigeration System contains anhydrous ammonia that continuously circulates through the system."

      "SummaryText": "  Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the system provides the needed cooling effect.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOverhill Farms has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to manage the safety aspects of the Refrigeration System.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by industry sources.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are ammonia detectors situated in all those compartments where ammonia is present.  \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Overhill Farms Refrigeration System is newly constructed.  Therefore, there have been no incidents where ammonia has been released to the atmosphere.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and management system improvements are being considered and implemented as a result of the technical studies done in the course of the development of the PSM and RMP Programs.  These improvements include a few instrumentation additions to the system, installation of vehicle barriers to protect equipment from vehicles, and several administrative changes that address specific practices and procedures regarding ammonia delivery, training and other tasks related to the operation of the Refrigeration System."
