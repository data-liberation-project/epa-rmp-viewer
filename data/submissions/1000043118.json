If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7\tThe activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nA\u00b7\t Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of this product. \r\nA\u00b7\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 236385 pounds in our one-30,000 gallon, and two-12,000 gallon storage  tanks.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 236385 pounds is rounded to 240000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be  131325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 131325 pounds is rounded to 130000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.4 miles.\r\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1A\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupati"
