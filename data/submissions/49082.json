The covered processes consist of piping, as per Chlorine Institute pamphlet 6, Piping Systems for Dry Chlorine, and chlorine injection equipment specifically designed for the process.\n\n\nPart 68.155 Section C\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nDecatur Utilities has used release scenarios for both worst case and alternative releases from, The Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, sponsored jointly by The American Water Works Association Research Foundation and The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development, and published by AWWA in 1998*. Additionally, the rate of release and endpoints corresponding to the above scenarios were derived from EPA CEPP, RMP Series, Risk Management for Wastewater Treatment Plants.** \n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a direct release over a 10 minute period, as required by the regulations. It involves catastrophic failure of a one ton container due to impact, corrosion, or construction defect. The entire contents of a full container, 2,000 pounds, is released over a ten minute period at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.* The toxic endpoint was modeled as 1.3 mile radius in all directions from the point of release.** The affected population was estimated at 910.***\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes release of chlorine gas through 20 feet of 1 inch schedule 80 pipe due to complete failure of the pipe. The scenario assumes that the pressure in the pipe is approximately 97.5 pounds per square inch, which is the vapor pressure of chlorine at 77 degrees F. It also assumes that the release is limited by the pipe dimensions and not by any valve or opening upstream of the release. The release duration is 60 minutes at an average release rate of 72 lb/min. The total release is 4,320 pounds with a toxic endpoint of 0.8 miles. The population is estimated at 560.\n\n\nPart 155.68 Section D"
