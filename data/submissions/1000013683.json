The facility is located in Mocane, KS.  The regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The equipment which handles anhydrous ammonia includes a pressure vessel and associated piping.  The pressure vessels and associated piping may contain over 278,226 lbs of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Mocane Ammonia Facility has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  These assets are owned and operated by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P.  Over the past five years, there have been no reports of a harmful ammonia release at this facility.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the companyA?s policy to notify the LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\n\nAs discussed in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the EPA has defined the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  At Mocane, the regulated substance is ammonia which is a toxic substance.  This WCS assumes the entire quantity contained in the largest vessel or section of piping within the ammonia system releases to the atmosphere, forms a vapor cloud, and is subsequently detonated.  One (1) pound per square inch overpressure is used as the endpoint as this is the threshold for potentially serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  \n\nAt Mocane the largest quantity of the covered toxic substance, ammonia, is the ammonia tank, VST-2150, containing 63,000 gallon vessels.  The WCS as"

      "SummaryText": "sumes this vessel in its entirety is released catastrophically to the atmosphere and the vapor cloud formed is ignited and then at some distance from the center of the explosion reaches an endpoint of one (1) PSI overpressure.  A total of 276,050 lbs is the maximum amount of ammonia that is stored in either vessel taking into account an administrative control limiting the maximum level of ammonia in the tank to 85%.  Using RMP*Comp to calculate the distance to endpoint, a 9.7 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if the worst case type of release occurred at Mocane.  \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO DESPRICTION\n\nFor the ammonia storage facility, the alternative case scenario is a release from a pump seal on the loading rack pump.  The seal fails and equates to approximately a 1A? hole.  This pump is downstream of the storage vessels and once the seal leak occurs, the pump is automatically shut down by the temperature transmitter located on the pump seal area within 30 seconds.  Once the pump is shut down, then the driving force is the liquid height of ammonia stored within the vessel at the time.  For this scenario, the assumption is that the season is summer when the tanks are typically full and the liquid has expanded due to warmer weather, so the full height of the tank is used to estimate the release rate.  The leak is detected by the toxic gas detectors at the location and then the nearest technician arrives within 25 minutes.  The technician evaluates the situation and puts on the proper PPE and isolates the pump by closing the suction and discharge valves after another 15 minutes have passed resulting in a total release time of 40 minutes.  \n\nIn this scenario, the release rate is 2420 lbs per min for 40 minutes for a total release volume of 96,800 lbs.  Using RMP*Comp to calculate the distance to endpoint, a 0.9 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if this alternative case release occurred at Mocane.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PR"

      "SummaryText": "OGRAM:\n\nThe regulated anhydrous ammonia storage/loading process in the facility is compliant with the thirteen (13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere has been no accidental release from the ammonia process at the Mocane Ammonia Facility that has required reporting under the RMP rule within the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years the ammonia process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the ammonia process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the ammonia process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the ammonia process arise at the Mocane Ammonia Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P.\n"
