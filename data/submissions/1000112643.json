The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency responders and local officials, recognition programs and participation in industry safet"
