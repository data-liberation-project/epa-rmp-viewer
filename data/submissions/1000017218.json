We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Propane Terminals and Storage Alma Terminal is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC and operated by Enterprise Propane Terminals and Storage, LLC.  The Alma Terminal is a LPG storage and loading terminal connected to the Dixie Pipeline interstate LPG pipeline system.    The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Alma Terminal that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Alma Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of propane tank trucks.

There are five tanks used to receive propane from the Dixie Pipeline system and to store the propane prior to loading into bulk tanker trucks for delivery.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, a truck loading dock, associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.    \n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which is received into five storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for distribution.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at Alma Terminal and is added to the propane as an odorant during the loading process.  The ethyl-mercaptan at Alma Terminal is present below the threshold quantity for this chemical specified in the RMP Rule. \n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of a propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion."

All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated release from a loading rack filter thermal relief valve on an adjacent, non-active loading rack.  The relief valve is assumed to open to vent pressure due to blocked-in thermal expansion of the propane, with the valve failing to reseat, venting the entire quantity of the filter into the loading rack area.  The filter has been calculated to contain 37 gallons (157 pounds) of propane that is released into the loading rack area and explodes in a vapor cloud explosion.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would ensure the isolation of the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
