There have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nThe emergency response program includes a facility-specific evacuation plan for which the personnel receive training, as well as the county-wide emergency response plan with the Kings County Fire Protection District as the designated responding unit, and the provision for notifying other agencies in the event of a release which threatens to go off-site.\n\nThe facility has an ongoing training program for all personnel, including initial (after hire) and periodic refresher training sessions.  Several changes in the physical plant will be made due to findings in the inspections performed in conjunction with the preparation of the RMP."

      "SummaryText": "The Britz Fertilizers, Inc. facility located near Hanford, California sells agricultural chemicals directly to farmers.\n\nThe facility has a training program for employees who handle chemicals and an inspection program by management to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  Employees are trained for emergency release to accidental releases.  The facility has a program for emergency notification of the Kings County Fire Protection District in the event of a accidental release which threatens to go off-site.  There are some residences and one school, but no prisons, hospitals, or other like public receptors within the range of the toxic end point of the worst case scenario.\n\nOne material (ammonia), in the form of anhydrous ammonia, which is listed in the RMP program, is handled at a volume in excess of the threshhold amount.\n\nThere are two separate processes at this facility which handle the ammonia:\n\n        1.  Anhydrous Ammonia Storage/Load-out (12,055 gallon gross water capacity) @ 52,771 pounds.\n        2.  Anhydrous Ammonia Storage/Load-out (12,000 gallon gross water capacity) @ 52,530 pounds.\n\nProgram 2 is the default program level for all facilities.  This faciliy does not manufacture fertilizers.  It purchases the agricultural chemicals wholesale and sells them retail directly to the farmers, who then use the products.  As such, it is not an OSHA PSM facility, nor is it under an NAICS code which requires a Program 3.  The facility has few public receptors within the worst-case zone and therefore does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 is therefore selected for this facility.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the total release of the 52,771 pounds from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, which has an off-site impact with a toxic endpoint at 1.03 miles.  The alternative scenario is a leak from a 2-inch pipe at the bulkhead during the small trailer filling operation, which has an off-site impact with a toxic endpoint of 0.6 miles off-site.
