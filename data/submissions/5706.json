      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1    Midland Resources, Inc. (Midland) manufactures ferric chloride, ferrous chloride and other chemicals for the water treatment industry using chlorine gas as one of the raw materials.  Chlorine has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act, which required the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Midland is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard and is submitting a program level 3 Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facility is located at 10 Bremen Ave., St. Louis, MO in what is primarily an industrial district near downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River.  \n\n2    It is Midland's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nThe owners and management of this facility regard employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working and public environment.  Some of these steps include:\n\n7 Installing chlorine sensors and alarms;\n7 Installing an automatic shutoff valve on the railcar unloading system;\n7 Instituting safe operating procedures;\n7 Training employees in safety programs and procedures;\n7 Writing a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan;\n7 Coordinating with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n3    Process Description\n\nChlorine gas is received in 90-ton rail tank cars   Normally, only one rail tank car is present on-site at a time.  However, when the quantity in one car is low (approximately 10 tons), a second car is ordered.  They are stored under ambient temperatures which can exceed 100 degrees F in the summer.  Normal internal pressure is 60 to70 psi, but on a hot day pressures may reach 180 psi in the process. \n\nThere are three reaction vessels which involve the use of chlorine.  The reaction vessels are designated R-7, R-19 and F-22.  Each reaction vessel is fitted with two, independent, pressure safety devices.  In case of reaction vessel "

In the unlikely case of continued overpressurization, a rupture disk is utilized as an additional safety feature.  \n\nChlorine gas is piped from the railcars to the reaction vessels, where it reacts with ferrous chloride to form ferric chloride.  \n 4    Worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe Clean Air Act risk management planning regulations require Midland to prepare a worst-case scenario consisting of the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel containing a regulated chemical in 10 minutes.  The largest chlorine-containing vessel is a rail car, whose content totals 90 tons (or 180,000 pounds).  Hence, the rate of release would be 90 tons/minute (18,000 pounds/minute.)  The USEPA provided software designated RMP*Comp (version 1.06) to assist in estimating the distance to a toxic endpoint, in the event of a release as describe herein.  The USEPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provides tables for obtaining toxic endpoints and exhibit B-1 of this guidance document provides 0.0087 mg/L as the toxic endpoint for Chlorine.  \n\nWorst-case scenario assumptions:\n\nThe contents of the rail car are released over a 10-minute period.\nAmbient temperature = 77 degrees F.\nLiquid chlorine is at 77 degrees F and 100 psig before the release.\nDense gas\n10 minute release\n18,000 pounds/minute\nUrban Conditions\nNo passive mitigation.\nAtmospheric Stability Class F \nWind Speed of 1.5 meters per second.\nThe toxic endpoint for Chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L\n\nThe estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 14 miles using RMP*Comp (version 1.06).\n\n5    Alternative Release scenario\n\nOn a hot day, a one inch diameter flexible line connecting the railcar to the rest of the process has a slow leak (not a complete break) from a 0.125 \" diameter hole.  The line pressure is assumed to be 180 psig.  The chlorine sensor is located about 5 feet horizontally from the rail "

An operator goes to the control room and puts a respirator on within 9 minutes and has the leak isolated in another 10 minutes.  Total time for the chlorine leak is 20 minutes\n\nEquation 11, from the OCA Guidance, yields a release rate of 3.92 pounds/minute for a  0.125 \" diameter hole.  The amount of chlorine released is 78.4 pounds\n\nAlternative release scenario assumptions:\n\nThe release situation is noted in approximately:     one minute\nOperator summoned and puts on respirator:     nine minutes\nOperator closes valve and isolates leak:    ten minutes\nTotal time of release:    20 minutes\n\nAmbient temperature = 104 degrees F\nLiquid chlorine is at 104 degrees F and 180 psig before the release.\nDense gas\n20 minute release\n3.92 pounds/minute\nUrban Conditions\nNo passive mitigation.\nAtmospheric Stability Class D\nWind speed of 3.0 meters/second\nThe toxic endpoint for Chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L\n\nRMP*Comp yields a distance of less than 0.1 mile.  In order to obtain a more conservative value, the tables from the OCA Guidance were utilized.  \nTable 16 of the OCA Guidance, using a release rate of 5 lb./min and toxic endpoint of 0.01 yields an estimated distance to toxic endpoint for this scenario of 0.19 miles. \n\n5    General accidental release prevention program\n\nThis facility has a strong commitment to the safe handling of chlorine and to minimizing the probability of an accidental release.  This is achieved through a combination of personnel training, process safety equipment and operating procedures.\n\n6    Five-year accident history\n\nThis facility had an accidental chlorine release on October 21, 1995 and another on June 28, 1998.  Each release involved less than 10 pounds.  On each occasion, one employee was injured and there were no off-site injuries.  After the first occurrence, new equipment was purchased to replace that which failed and resulted in the release.  After the second occurren"

The Emergency Response Plan contains specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine, procedures to inform the public and health care information.  All employees working with chlorine are given 40 hour Hazwoper training with annual 8 hour refreshers.  This plan has been coordinated with the St. Louis City LEPC.  The telephone number for the LEPC is (314) 289-1900.\n\n 8    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe planned changes (both procedural and equipment changes) were documented during and after the Process Hazard Analyses which were conducted on April 15 and 29, 1999.  A checklist is being utilized to track the progress of these changes and improvements."
