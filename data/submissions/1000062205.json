The Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Boise City Farmers Coop are committed to the prevention of\n\nany accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared\n\nto work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the\n\nimpact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop\n\nproduction nutrients.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a\n\ngas\n\nover 10 minutes.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential\n\nincident) is a\n\nrelease from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is\n\n1.3 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia,\n\nKk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S.\n\nOccupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History:\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nTo our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage,\n\nor environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess\n\nthe\n\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\n\nrecommendations\n\nfor implementation at this time."
