These procedures are subject to a management of change procedure, which allow the facility management to review and update procedures and programs when necessary.  Newark Tank Depot will continue to review the procedures and implement protective solutions to health and safety concerns.  There are no additional planned changes to improve safety associated with the handling of extraordinary hazardous substances at this time.
