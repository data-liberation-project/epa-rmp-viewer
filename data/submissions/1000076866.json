The Facility Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Premier Ag, LLC are committed to the prevention of any\r\naccidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to\r\nwork with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\r\nthe release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substance(s) Handled\r\nThis facility is a retail farm supply center and handles a variety of farm supplies, including dry and liquid\r\nfertilizers, crop protection products, seed, and other related agricultural inputs. This facility is a retailer of\r\nanhydrous ammonia, a product regulated by U. S. EPA. We receive anhydrous ammonia by truck, store that\r\nproduct on-site in one 26,000 gallon storage tank and then distribute the product to our customers in 1,000\r\ngallon and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The only processes related to anhydrous ammonia at this location are\r\nusing a liquid pump to move the product from the delivery truck into the storage tank, and then using a liquid\r\npump to move the product from the storage tank into the 1,000 gallon and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific\r\nPrevention Steps\r\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. This facility also\r\ncomplies with the standards of the U. S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR\r\n1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Additional information is contained in our \"Safety\r\nand Environmental Manual\". Other steps used to prevent the accidental release of ammonia include routine\r\nsafety and maintenance inspections, employ"

The Five Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any\r\ndeaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility or, to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site\r\ninjuries, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5. The Emergency Response Program\r\nThis facility has a written Emergency Response Plan, in accordance with OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and\r\n29 CFR 1910.120. We also have provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and\r\ncommunity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). All employees receive ongoing training related to safe handling procedures for ammonia, equipment maintenance, and personal\r\nprotective equipment requirements. All employees are also prepared to implement the Emergency Response\r\nPlan as outlined for the facility.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility. Periodic inspections and checklists are performed\r\nto assess the maintenance and safety conditions of all components in the ammonia handling process. There\r\nare no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
