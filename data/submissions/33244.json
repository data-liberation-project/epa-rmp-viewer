The Los Angeles Department \nof Water and Power (LADWP) also uses ammonia for reducing the emissions of oxides of \nnitrogen from its Haynes Generating Station (HNGS). Storing and handling large quantities \nof ammonia can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing \nand using ammonia as seriously as it takes in power generation. The LADWP Haynes \nGenerating Station ammonia handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California \nAccidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and \nCalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  \nThe RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the \nactions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency. LADWP prepared \nand submitted the RMP for the Haynes Generating Station in June 1999.  This RMP is five \nyear update of June 1999 RMP.

Instead, the facility has \ncoordinated with local response agencies (City of Long Beach Fire Department) to respond to \nany ammonia release that may occur at the HNGS facility.\n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n      Haynes Generating Station is located at 6801 East 2nd Street, Long Beach, California \n90803.  The HNGS is a gas-fired electricity generating facility that supplies electrical power \nto the LADWP system.  The facility has six power generating units that burn natural gas or \nfuel oil as back-up emergency fuel to produce steam to drive electric generator turbines.  The \ntotal capacity of the plant is 1580 megawatts of electric power.  The facility is managed and \noperated around the clock.  There is a minimum crew of ten operators and one shift \nsupervisor.  On a normal day shift, there are approximately 161 on-site personnel including \nOperations, Technical, Maintenance, Clerical, and Warehouse staff.\n\n      Units 1, 2, 5, and 6 are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to \ncontrol emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a combustion byproduct that is a precursor to \nozone.  In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR, ammonia (NH3) gas, a reducing \nagent, is injected into the flue gas to react with NOx to form nitrogen gas (N2) and water \nvapor (H2O) according to the following chemical reactions:\n      \n   4 NH3   +   6 NO --> 5  N2   +   6 H2O\n   8 NH3   +   6 NO2 -->  7  N2   +   12 H2O\n   \nAmmonia Process Description\n\n      The ammonia solution storage and supply system (ammonia process) has the function \nof storing and delivering ammonia for injection for NOx emissions control in Units 1, 2, and \n5.

Aqueous ammonia solution is used \ninstead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards \nrequiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing.  The risks and \nsafety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for \ntransportation and storage of ammonia solution.\n\n      Ammonia solution at 29% concentration (29% ammonia and 71% water) is stored in \nsix 37,500 gallon, aboveground tanks.  The maximum inventory is 30,000 gallons per tank.  \nThe tanks are each 37-foot long cylinders with 14-foot diameters and are surrounded by a \ncontainment system consisting of 6 inch thick, 142.5 feet long, 62.5 feet wide, and 3 feet \nhigh concrete walls.  A 6.0-gallon-per-minute (gpm) pump dispenses ammonia solution to \nthe emission control equipment.  Other safety equipment associated with these tanks are: \npressure/vacuum relief valves, liquid level alarms, two ammonia vapor scrubbers, quick fill \nconnections, vapor recovery and associated piping, eight strategically-located ammonia vapor \ndetectors, three emergency eyewash/shower stations, and three containment sumps equipped \nwith normally closed drain valves.\n\n      Ammonia solution is delivered by truck that parks within a sloped containment area, \nwhich drains to a 3?x3?x1? sump (unloading area sump).  The solution unloading to the \nstorage tanks is done through a quick fill connection.  A truck-mounted vapor recovery \nsystem is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading.  The storage \ntanks are equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tanks are maintained at \nambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\n      A redundant dispensing pump is placed into service when either the main p"

A second alarm at 50 ppm will initiate a system shutdown and the lock-out of \nthe ammonia feed pumps.\n\nEmission Control\n\n      Ammonia solution is pumped from storage tanks to two evaporator and air mixing \nchamber systems for Units 1, 2, 5, and 6.  Heated air is provided to the air-mixing chamber for units 1 and 2 by \ndilution air fans and heaters.  Units 5 and 6 use boiler flue gases for heating the ammonia vapor. The air/water vapor/ammonia mixture is then piped to the Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG), which is located in the flue gas duct up stream of the SCR.  \nThe injection is done through an arrangement of nozzles to assure an even ammonia gas \ndistribution throughout the flue gas.

For each internal \naudit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance \nAudit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, \nthe dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader and the Plant \nManager.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element \nand contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each \nelement consists of the following three sections:\n\n* Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n* On-Site Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on \nobservation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n* Interviews:  The program elements are evaluated by interviewing personnel from \nappropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\n\n      Team members record RMP program deficie"

The \nincident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The \nLADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the \nrecommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.  All incident \ninvestigation reports are retained on LADWP file for at least a period of five years from the \ndate the reports are completed.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\n      No accidental releases of ammonia gas or solution that meet the reporting \nrequirement of the EPA?s RMP have occurred at this facility for the past five years (i.e. after \nJune 1999).\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\n      The HNGS facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility \nemployees will not respond to aqueous ammonia accidental release.  Instead, the facility has \ncoordinated with local response agencies to respond to any aqueous ammonia release than \nmay occur at the HNGS facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n      As part of the preparation of a Risk Management Program, a hazard review was \nperformed in June 1999 for the ammonia handling system.  The hazard review was \nperformed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both \nequipment and procedures used for the ammonia handling system.  A number of equipment \nand procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended \nactions.  All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the \nLADWP. Additional 16 changes to further improve ammonia safety were identified in April \n2004, when the hazard review was completed for the facility. It is expected that these \nrecommendations will be evaluated by December 2004.  The implementation of these \nrecommendatio"
