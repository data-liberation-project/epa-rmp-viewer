      "SummaryText": "The City of Muskogee, Oklahoma operates a water treatment plant located within the city limits in the northeast part of town. This plant stores chlorine in one-ton cyliders at the plant. The maximum inventory is 18-tons and the plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at anyone time to four. The maximum population within the area of potential affect under a worst case release scenario is less than one thousand. There are no federal natural habitat facilities or preserves located within the maximum toxic endoint radius. In the event of a significant release, the emergency will be handled through the Muskogee Fire Department. However there have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe City of Muskogee, Oklahoma operates a water treatment plant located within the city limits in the northern portion of the city. The plant uses chlorine to treat the citys drinking water for the city.\nThe water treatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The maximum inventory is 12 tons and the water treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to four.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Muskogee Water Plant is a 1 ton cylinder resulting in an estimated Level of Concern [LOC] of 1.2 miles using the National Safety Councils ALOHA mapping program. The first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] from the cylinder to the header pipe. This has an estimated LOC of 0.99 miles and a release of approximately 1000 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. The second alternate scenario is a release representative of a culmination of both of the previous scenarios. This could occur if a tank ruptured and other tanks were able, due to failure of controls, to flow back along the header pipe and out the broken transfer hose [whip]. This would result in the release of approximately 1.5 tons of chlorine and result in a LOC footprint o"

Because of the strict implementation of the above-mentioned programs, this facility has not had a release within the last five years.\n\n\nThe Muskogee Water Plant holds training and refresher courses for the personnel at the facility regarding the chlorine system and its concerns.  If an accident occurred, the Local Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC] and the Muskogee Fire Department would be notified and would respond immediately.\n\nThe Muskogee Water Plant has no current plans to change the chlorine process in the foreseeable future."
