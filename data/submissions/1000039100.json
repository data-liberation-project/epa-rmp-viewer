It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Grafton Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Hancock Emergency Management Agency will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowleded that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primany emergency coordinator for Viafield, Grafton, Iowa is Curt Schaub, Agronomy Team Leader.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1-1989 with amendments and State law.\r\n\r\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valve. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.  Finally, Viafield has extended to the Grafton Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participte in mock emergency simulation training and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nViafield, Grafton, IA  has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Viafield, Grafton, Iowa to immediately notify the Grafton Volunteer Fire Department and the Hancock Emergency Management Agency to request that they respond to the emergency.

      "SummaryText": "that the Grafton Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our location, the volunteer fire department with whom Grafton has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have  discussed this policy with the fire department and Hancock Emergency Management Agency.  Members of the fire department and the Hancock Emergency Management Agency have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant.  In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human heaalth and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
