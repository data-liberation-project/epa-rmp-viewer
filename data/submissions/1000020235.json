      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\nThe Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located in Garland, Texas, at 2500 E. Centerville Road.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Garland.  This wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 32,000 pounds of chlorine and 12,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68, are stored or utilized at the facility.\n\nSafety Policies:\nThe City of Garland is fully committed to safety at the wastewater treatment plant.  The City recognizes the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements to further refine its program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the plant and the Garland Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, should a release occur.  Finally, the City is committed to continuing to improve its risk management program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Rowlett Creek WRC.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe City's commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide is demonstrated by its excellent track record with these substances.  The Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has not experienced an accident related to chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years or at any time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nAir dispersion modeling for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide was updated in June 2004 and reviewed in May 2009.  This modeling produced the same radius of impact for both substances for the worst-case scenario.  Public receptors including residences, educational facilities, park recreational facilities, hospitals/medical facilities, prisons, and major commercial/business/industrial buildings are located within the worst-case radius.

      "SummaryText": "required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysis also developed alternative-release scenarios for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  A recently installed emergency gas scrubber discharging as designed resulted in no offsite impact.  An alternative scenario involving a scrubber malfunction resulted in a 0.68 mile radius of impact.  These radii of impact are useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description:\nThe City's prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air are minimized.  This component is used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program has become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel.\n\nThe Prevention Program includes seven  primary components:\n\n*Safety Information:  Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n*Hazard Review:  Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard review have been resolved in a timely manner.\n\n*Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures have been updated to account for a revent major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances.\n\n*Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in thr processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n*Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the"

      "SummaryText": " process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Process equipment for regulated substance processes is inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n\n*Compliance Audits:  The prevention program must be audited at least once every three years to evaluate compliance with risk management rules.  The initial audit was conducted in June 2002 and deficiencies have been addressed. Most recent audits were in July 2007 and May 2009.\n\n*Incident Investigation:  Should an accident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety process.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe City of Garland has determined that the Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant  will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The Garland Fire Department will instead be the appropriate local emergency response agency in such cases.  The Garland Fire Department has the necessary training to respond to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks.  Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel have coordinated with the Fire Department to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan regarding response to a potential release.\n\nThe facility's employees have a significant role in the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Should a release occur or be suspected, employees responsible for working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop the release using normal shutdown procedures.  Facility personnel receive ongoing training in identification of potential releases, and in how to determine when emergency response personnel should be involved.\n\nRowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant will continue to work closely with the Fire Department to ensure that emer"

Coordination may include:\n\n*periodic meetings between operators and Fire Department emergency responders to discuss emergency response measures.\n\n*periodic inspections of the facility by Fire Department emergency responders to ensure their familiarity with routes to the facility, ingress and egress routes at the facility, and layout of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process areas."
