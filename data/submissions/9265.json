This facility is known as the Niagara Falls Plant and is located in the city of Niagara Falls on Buffalo Avenue.  The Chlor-Alkali facility consists of a plant which manufactures chlorine, caustic, hydrogen and also has facilities to store,  load and ship chlorine.  The Specialty Chemical areas main emphasis is the chlorination and fluorination of toluene.  Other operations include production of nitrile compounds, flame retardants, and muriatic acid. The Niagara Plant facility was originally constructed in 1906 and currently employs 650 full-time employees.\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a)):\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Niagara Falls plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility  which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Niagara Falls Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA's PSM regulation 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Niagara Falls Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Niagara Falls Plant consists of the following three elements:"

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 9265,
      "SummaryText": "\n\n* A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n\n* A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\n\n* An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Niagara Falls Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program at the Niagara Falls Plant.  In fact, the Niagara Falls Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nFacility's policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the Niagara Falls Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Niagara Falls Plant, it is reviewed to understand the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and then steps are taken to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications to existing processes.\n\nThe Facility strives to prevent accidental releases of  hazardous substances used:  The Niagara Falls Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Niagara F"

      "SummaryText": "alls Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  The facility also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or making significant modifications to existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, The facility requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Facility's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nThe Facility's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release, the Niagara Falls Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment. The Niagara Falls Plant utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulations and maintains an active Emergency Response Team which is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental chemical release.  OxyChem also has established a Special Situations Center at the corporate headquarters in Dallas, Texas to assist in all emergency situations. In addition, The Niagara Falls Plant works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  \n\nNiagara Falls Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations.

If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Niagara Falls Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CAER) Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\nThe Facility is an active participant in the community:  The Niagara Plant is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in June, 1996 as an OSHA Star facility under  OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs. \n\nThe Niagara Falls Plant is an industry leader in the implementation of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association sponsored Responsible Care(r) Initiative. As part of OxyChem's Responsible Care(r) efforts, the Niagara Falls plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since 1991. The purpose of this group is to share information about  plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, OxyChem established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n\n2.
