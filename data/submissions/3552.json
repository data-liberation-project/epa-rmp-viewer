The City of Nederland is committed to safety of its employees and the health and welfare of the surrounding community that ti serves. It is the policy of the City of Nederland to comply with all applicable Federal and state regulations.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat municipal wastewater to protect public health and the environment and state waterways  exceeding state and federal permit standards and regulations. The wastewater is brought to the facility via a complex collection system including several sewage lift stations. The sewage is then passed through a variety of biological processes for purification and then disinfected with chlorine for a specified amount of time as prescribed by the TNRCC and then dechlorinated with Ammonium Bisulphite and discharged into the state approved outfall. The plant is surrounded by a six foot high chain link fence topped with three strands of barbed wire and access is restricted to authorized employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. Chlorine is the only substance regulated under the Clean Air Act at this site. The chlorine is brought in by truck and delivered in ton containers. The ton containers are then hooked up to a vacuum assisted chlorination system where it is put into a solution with water in a sealed piping system where it is delivered into the disinfection process. Only two containers can be connected at one time. The total inventory of chlorine at this facility is 8000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the failure of a one ton container. If full, it would release 2000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents would be released as vapor, which is two and half times heavier than air. The dist"

A release of this kind would have an offsite impact. \n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes a failure of the transfer connection hose. The chlorine would have to release through a 0.25 inch opening. The release rate would be 41.7 pounds per minute. The distance to the toxic enpoint would be 0.1 miles. A release of this kind would have an offsite impact. This scenario was selected because it was the most plausible.\n\nThe modeling program used to calculate the endpoint distances is the RMP* Comp provided by the EPA. This was used for the worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nBecause the City of Nederland is a municipality it does not fall directly under any OSHA rules. However, it is the City of Nederland's policy to adhere as closely as possible to OSHA regulations. The City of Nederland has an aggressive safety program. This program includes regular safety inspections of all facilities and equipment by the safety department. There is also a safety review board that reviews all accidents that occur in the workplace and make reccomendations on preventing future accidents.\n\nAll treatment plant operators on duty are required to make a visual inspection of the plant every two hours. All operators are trained in the use of SCBA's (self contined breathing apparatus) that can be used in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe City of Nederland's Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had a reportable accidental release of chlorine in the last five years. The Treatment plant has been in continuious operation for that period.\n\nThe City of Nederland's emergency response plan is designed to ensure the safety of employees and the surrounding communities. The plant operators will not try to repair or stop a major leak. The operator on duty will notify the Nederland  Fire Department and other emergency departments by calling 911. The Nederland Fire Department will be the supervising agency and will determine what"
