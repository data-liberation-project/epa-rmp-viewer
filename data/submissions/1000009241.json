The primary activity at the Facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and unloaded at the Goshen Yard Facility.\n\nThe Buttonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP Program requirements (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \u00c2\u00bfRisk Management Plan (RMP)\u00c2\u00bf 40 CFR \u00c2\u00a768).  The facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility\u00c2\u00bfs staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and distributing anhydrous ammonia. This is a EPA RMP Program 3 facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia storage and distribution system.  It is the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated toxic substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Time Room facility receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  There is a lone 20,000 gallon storage tank at the facility with a maximum capacity of 16,000 gallons. The storage level on the storage tank is administratively controlled not to exceed 80% of the tank's maximum capacity. The Time Room Facility currently uses 82,400 lbs of toxic materials, which consists of the contents of the lone 20,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe system is composed of the following key equipment:\n- Anhydrous Ammonia 20,000 gallon storage tank\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFF SITE"

The worst-case scenario is presented in the Hazard Assessment section of the RMP folder. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: A realistic toxic alternative release scenario was modeled utilizing a pressure relief valve (PRV) failure. The alternative release scenario is presented in the Hazard Assessment section of the RMP folder.\n\nOff-site Receptors\nRMP requirements state that sensitive populations such as schools, hospitals, day-care centers, long-term health care facilities, prisons, residential areas, public use parks/recreational areas, and major commercial facilities, located within the \u00c2\u00bfat risk\u00c2\u00bf area must be identified.  These sensitive populations include individuals who could not remove themselves from the exposure area without assistance.  The sensitive populations also include industrial installations which may have a hazardous process that can not be immediately left unattended. \n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and the worst-case release scenarios will likely reach a community; the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc., has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the pote"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe toxic material Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractors\n- Emergency Planning and Response\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of toxic materials at the facility in at least the past five (5) years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.
