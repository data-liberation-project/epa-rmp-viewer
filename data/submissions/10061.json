This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release or initiate our emergency action plan if deemed necessary. \n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n The Upham Chico gas plant, located near Chico Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas.  The Upham Chico gas plant has regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. Additionally, the Upham Chico gas plant uses ammonia,  which is also a regulated substance.\n \n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a catastrophic pipe failure in the ammonia refrigeration system, resulting in a release of 3000 pounds over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of .14 milligrams per liter for this WCS is .51 miles.  No Program Level 1 processes containing regulated toxic substances were identified at the gas plant.\n \n The alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia is a pump seal failure in the ammonia pump, resulting in a release of 15 lb of ammonia over a 25-minute period.  The 25-minu"

No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of .14 milligrams per liter for this ARS is 0.06 mile.\n \n The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 102,000 lb (80% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  Only 38 percent of the propane would flash into vapor and a like amount is included as aerosol and spray. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS (77,520 pounds) is 0.34 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n  The ARS for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a ruptured loading hose (2410 lb released in 5 minutes).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 5 minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.1 mile. The propane transport trailers are protected by self closing valves. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n \n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses e"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Employees are encouraged to offer suggested changes to the accident prevention plan that is maintained at the gas plant. Employee participation is not limited to plant operators. Representatives from plant operations, maintenance, safety and management, collectively search for methods and materials which will encourage safe operations.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Upham Chico gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the company are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations section of the PSM/RMP manual. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n  The gas plant also maintains  technical documen"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n The Upham Chico gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n The Upham Chico gas plant primarily uses the \"What If\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations. \"What If\" analysis is recognized as a valuable hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n \n The PHA team findings are forwarded to  management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Upham Chico gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n  Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Upham Chico gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, company policy concerning hot work, confined space entry, lockout/tagout and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Upham Chico gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \n The Upham Chico gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n \n Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n \n Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Upham Chico gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that "

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation's. \n \n Compliance Audits\n \n To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Upham Chico gas plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n \n CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \n The processes at the Upham Chico gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n \n Universal Prevention Activities\n \n The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Upham Chico gas plant.
