We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Chemours site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown\".  We operate one process using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The process produces HCFC-22 with HFC-23 and hydrogen chloride as by-products.  The process uses fluorine based technology.  We share the site with a DuPont Vinyl Fluoride manufacturing facility.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemicals on our site is the rupture of an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride railcar, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed.  According to EPA's RMPComp program for worst case scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Rupture of a railcar is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields.   \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nChlorine -- A 1/8\" hole develops in a liquid chlorine pipeline.  The leak is assumed to continue for 60 minutes with no mitigation.  Using EPA's RMPComp program for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would potentially have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.   \n\n\n\nChloroform -- A 1/2\" hole develops at the base of a storage tank releasing chloroform into a concrete dike.  The leak is assumed to continue for 15 hours until the remaining contents "

In addition to regular patrols and process monitoring by trained operating personnel, we employ remote sensors for chlorine and hydrogen fluoride and closed-circuit television monitoring of the manufacturing area.  We have on-site alarm and public address systems to alert and inform personnel of an emergency situation.  All of our operating personnel are trained as HAZMAT technicians according to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120.  Emergency response team members receive additional training in capping, patching, plugging, and other techniques for stopping leaks.\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
