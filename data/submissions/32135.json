IF AN ACIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE THE RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHIS FACILITY RETAILS ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TO FARMERS FOR NITROGEN FERTILIZATION.  THE MAXIMUM QUANITY STORED IS 140,196 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORED IN ONE 30,000 GALLON TANK.\n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,196, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.16MILES.\n\nB.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKLEY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .41 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\" OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.  WE ARE ALSO GUIDED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\"\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT THAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPETY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY, NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, AND EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6.
