      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of City of Naples to operate a safe water treatment facility, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees and the environment. It is our policy to promote a spirit of cooperation and team work among the employees at the Water Treatment Plant; it is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at the facility. During the most recent Compliance Audit 11/20/2006 several issues with the RMP plan were discovered requiring a resubmit of the plan.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is municipal water treatment. Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility. Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant. The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility was  increased to 24 tons on 02/14/2007 to allow for additional supply in preperation for disasters.  The average amount of chlorine at the facility will remain at 20 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\" The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container damaged during moving inside the storage building. The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\nThe chlorine toxic enpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts per million by volume (ppm). According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guidline (ERPG)-2, this toxic end point is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could"

      "FacilityID": 47721,
      "SummaryText": " be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe EPA's RMP*COMP? computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario. The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 1.03 miles. This distance considered the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of active mitigation measures such as the emergency scrubber.\n\nA worst-case release is unlikely due to the materials of construction of the chlorine container. In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a leak at the tank valve during change out of a cylinder with the emergency scrubber in operation. It is assumed that a one-ton container releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building. When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario; all the chlorine gas was neutralized through the emergency scrubber. According to the instructions in the EPA's RMP*Comp? any distiance to endpoint less than 0.1 mile be reported as 0.1 miles.  This alternative release scenario is not likley to occur; however, it demonstrates that off-site impacts do not occur even for a complete release of a one-ton container when the active mitigation system is used.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCity of Naples is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The City has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\nThe City has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.

A brief discription of each follows: \n\n09/23/2006 while changing a one-ton container the employee had a minor leak at the packing gland which was stopped immediately.  Investigation determined a revision was required to the SOP; completed and discussed with employees.\n\n01/31/2006 while calibrating chlorine sensor a regulator was bumped causing a minor leak that was stopped immediately.  No recommendations to change policy. \n\n09/08/2006 regulator developed minor leak; stopped immediately and repaired.\n\n06/02/2005 during delivery a pin broke on lifting boom causing container to drop three feet to bed of truck. Put vendor on notice for safety concerns.\n\n03/15/2005 during delivery a hydraulic hose on the truck burst. Notified vendor of safety concerns.\n\n05/02/2004 employee failed to follow SOP placing fellow employees and public at risk; started chlorine change out alone and left site; employee was disciplined for actions.\n\n03/21/2004 while changing container employee had minor leak at connection that was stopped immediately. It was repositioned and tested.\n\n02/21/2002 the chlorine supplier, Allied Universal, dropped a one-ton container off the back of the delivery truck. The container landed on a track causing two large dents. No chlorine was released. Allied was called to pick up the full continer. Allied was notified to use an acceptable delivery vehicle. Bid specs were modified to require vendor to use an articulating trailer for off-loading and loading one-ton containers.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that ha"
