These programs provide for the implementation of detailed\r\nprevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP\r\nprograms. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat\r\ntemperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing RMP comp and the population data is\r\nbased upon information pulled from Marplot on 06/18/2015. How to determine the WCS & ARS was\r\nderived from the EPA document, Risk Management Program guidance for offsite consequences of\r\nanalysis (1999).\r\n\r\nThe WCS is based upon the loss of the single largest vessel filled to 80%. The site location utilizes administrative controls during the ammonia charging process to prevent the filling of this vessel beyond 80% full.Prior to this filing the capacity of this vessel had been calculated incorrectly. Fortunately, the true impact on the environment and the community (albeit highly unlikely to occur) is less than previously reported.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the\r\nsystem, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and"

Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\r\n\r\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents\r\nAssociated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department / Hazmat Team will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an\r\nAmmonia release, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police department will notify residents and business locations.\r\n\r\nSection 1.17c previously reported the onsite quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia as being 35028 pounds. This figure is the Maximum intended inventory for the facility, not the actual quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia. The actual quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia on site is 25,261 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had a reportable release in the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews,\r\nMechanical Integrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure mitigation and control of potential incidents.\r\n\r\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during\r\nthe Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity\r\ninspections to improve the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and\r\nimplemented in a timely manner."
