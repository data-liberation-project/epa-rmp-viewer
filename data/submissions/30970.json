In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrencem and minimize the consequences, of significant release of toxic substances as well as fire, explosions, and other types of castostrophic accidents.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities and pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by our employees at this facility.  Failure of our high temperature recirculator vessel containing 4,176 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the worst case senario.  The capacity of this vessel, with a ten minute release could affect a .9 mile radius of the facility that would affect the local community.  The vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and aid to contain such a release. Industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels were employed.  There are pressure safety relief valves limiting the operating pressure.  The facility includes a regular maintenance program, including inspection, testing and replacement of equipment when necessary. There is an emergency response plan that coordinates with the local response personnel. Failure of a HGD line located on the roof resulting in 117 pounds per minute of ammonia vapor.  Over a period of 10 minutes as the alternate case senario, the ammonia could travel .19 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. There is a mechanicl integrity program for regular maintenance, inpsection and testing, and replacement of equipment if necessary: and there is a facility ammonia awareness program and emergency response plan in place at the facility.
