FPC-TX is a vertically integrated organization. It consists of eleven \"covered process\" operations, and four support organizations. The facility is located in the city of Point Comfort, Calhoun County, Texas. The facility currently employs approximately 1600 employees.\n\n\n\nThe \"Covered Processes\" are:\n\n\n\n    Olefins 1\n\n    Olefins 2\n\n    Polypropylene 1\n\n    Polypropylene 2\n\n    High Density Polypropylene 1\n\n    High Density Polypropylene 2\n\n    Linear Low Density Polyethylene\n\n    Polyvinyl Chloride\n\n    Vinyl Chloride Monomer\n\n    Marine Traffic\n\n    Inland Traffic\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared by the Corporate Director of Security & Risk Management Each operating unit has appointed one individual as the person responsible for implementation of the RMP in that Unit. The Environmental, Health and Safety Department, through the Emergency Response Coordinator, oversees, provides guidance, and audits the RMP activities of the operating units.\n\n\n\nCompliance with 29 CFR 1910.119: On May 26, 1992, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule went into effect. FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVERED PROCESS - BRIEF DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nOlefins 1 & 2\n\n\n\nThe Olefins 1 and Olefins 2 are comprised of pyrolysis furnaces used to crack a range of feedstock consisting of propane (3), natural gas liquids (NGL) (2), naphtha (4), and an ethane/propane mixture (1).  The resulting products are ethylene (7), propylene (8), a mixed C4 product (9), pyrolysis gasoline (10), and pyrolysis fuel oil (11).  The furnaces are fired with fuel gas (5).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene 1\n\n\n\nThe Polypropylene I Unit utilizes BASF gas-phase reactor technology to produce polypropylene resin using propylene supplied from the Olefins Plant.

From the blending silos, the pellets are sent to the Pellet Product Silos for temporary storage.  The PP pellets (L) are then loaded into railcars and sent to customers.\n\n\n\nPolypropylene 2\n\n\n\nThe Polypropylene II Unit utilizes Chisso/Amoco technology to produce polypropylene resin using propylene supplied from the Olefins Plant.

The HDPE II Plant has the capability of producing different grades of products for various applications by customers.   The HDPE II Plant is broken down into the following sections: Catalyst Preparation and Activation, Feed Preparation, Polymerization, Gas Recovery, Extrusion / Blending & Storage / Rail Car Loading.\n\n\n\nThe polymerization process reaction is continuous and occurs in a slurry phase with isobutane as the carrier solvent.  The slurry is directed to the High Pressure Flash Chamber where gases and light hydrocarbons are volatilized and exit through the top of the chamber.

      "SummaryText": "ride\n\n\n\nThe PVC process is suspension polymerization.  The general overall process involves the suspension of liquid vinyl chloride monomer in a continuous water phase.  The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction.  The reaction is initiated most commonly with an organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags. \n\n\n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\n\n\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene.  Four oxychlorination trains are used to combine ethylene, hydrogen chloride, and oxygen to form ethylene dichloride.  Purified EDC (10) is thermally cracked into VCM and HCl in the EDC Crackers. The VCM produced in the furnaces is purified, washed, dried, and sent to the Polyvinyl Chloride department for conversion to PVC.  HCl (6) is also purified to meet the quality required as the raw material for the oxychlorination section.  EDC is recycled back to the process. \n\n\n\n\n\nMarine Traffic\n\n\n\nMarine Traffic is charged with loading liquid products and unloading liquid feedstock to and from ships and barges.  Products are sent from the process units and Inland Traffic by pipeline and tank truck to the Marine Traffic Tank Farm for temporary storage until waterborne transportation can be arranged for FPC customers.  Upon receiving shipping orders and the vessel to be loaded, Marine Traffic pumps the products from the Tank Farm to the Marine Terminal by pipeline into loading arms, and finally into the vessel.  Transfer hoses may also be used.\n\n\n\nAt the Marine Terminal Tank Farm, raw materials off-loaded from barges and ships are stored prior to utilization by the plant and products from the plant are stored prior to loading into ships and barges. At the Marine Facility Dock Area, products are loaded onto barges and ships.  The loading emissions are collected and burned in the Marine Fa"

Ethylene Dichloride (EDC) is stored in tanks prior to being transferred to Marine Traffic or being sent to the Ethylene Glycol Plant. Ethylene glycol's -- monoethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and triethylene glycol -- from the Ethylene Glycol Plant are stored in EG storage tanks prior to loading into railcars and trucks.  Inland Traffic also receives propylene via railcars.

The equipment installed in the units was designed based on either ASTM, ANSI, or ASME standards. Before starting the each unit, a process hazard analysis (PHA) as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 was completed. The methodology used was the Hazards and Operability Study.  Since the last PHA study, process parameters have been changed, and additional process controls, process detection systems and mitigation systems have been installed.\n\n\n\nDuring the study, the PHA Team evaluated major hazards like, toxic gas release; fire; explosion; runaway reaction; polymerization; ov"
