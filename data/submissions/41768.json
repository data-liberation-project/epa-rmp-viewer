In response to the County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Management Division, this Risk Management Program document (RMP) has been developed for the South Bay Power Plant (SBPP) located in Chula Vista, California.  This document has been prepared to satisfy the following regulations: \n-California Office of Emergency Services, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, October 10, 2002.\n-Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\n2. The purpose of this document is to facilitate the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by providing to the public and regulatory agencies information on regulated substances, a 5-year history of no accidents, potential offsite consequences of a hypothetical worst-case release, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\n3. The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent by weight).  The facility uses aqueous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of boiler flue gas nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and water and is operated by Duke Energy South Bay LLC. \n\n4. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Data Elements are contained in Chapter 2.0 of this RMP.  The format of Chapter 2.0 differs from the rest of this document because that chapter is generated by software issued by the EPA.\n\n5. Information required in the RMP by the EPA Risk Management Program and the CalARP Program is summarized in Sections 1.2 through 1.5.\n\n\n1.2  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n1. The SBPP has a Facility Emergency Plan (revised July 2002) that provides guidance for emergency response including emergency coordination, notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations"

      "SummaryText": ", ammonia health hazards, and management procedures for responding to emergencies.  The objective of the Facility Emergency Plan guidance is to avoid, or at least minimize, injuries to onsite and offsite persons, environmental damage, and property damage.\n\n2. Changes in operation or physical equipment, designed to decrease risk from hazardous materials and agreed to during an inspection, are implemented as soon as practical thereafter.\n\n3. The Facility Emergency Plan is reviewed and updated periodically, and when changes occur that affect response procedures. \n\n\n1.3  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n1. The SBPP uses aqueous ammonia to reduce boiler NOx emissions to elemental nitrogen and water.  The NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia in the SCR catalyst.  The elemental nitrogen and water remain in the flue gas as it passes through the stack to the atmosphere.  The SCR reactor is designed to reduce NOx by approximately 90 percent when firing natural gas in the boiler, and by approximately 85 percent if No. 6 fuel oil is used in the boiler.  \n\n2. Aqueous ammonia containing 29.4 percent by weight ammonia is a regulated substance under both CalARP and the federal program because the maximum quantity in a process or storage container (21,122 gallons of solution or 158,350 pounds of solution or 46,555 pounds of ammonia) exceeds the state and federal threshold quantities of 500 and 20,000 pounds, respectively. \n\n3. The current maximum quantity of stored aqueous ammonia is 316,700 pounds (21,122 gallons x 2 tanks, set by high level controls).  Room is available for a third identical tank, which can be added when SCR systems are installed on other units.\n\n\n\n1.4  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n1. The SCR and aqueous ammonia systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code and the Uniform Fire Code."

      "SummaryText": "  These codes serve to reduce the risk within the facility by specifying acceptable design criteria for the aqueous ammonia systems and onsite buildings.  In addition, the facility was designed in accordance with industry standards and with generally accepted engineering practices.  Aqueous ammonia is used instead of anhydrous liquid ammonia to reduce the consequences of a potential release.\n\n2. The facility has a monthly audit checklist for maintaining and operating the SCR equipment, and uses the \"Operation, Maintenance and Safety Manual of the Babcock and Wilcox Selective Catalytic Reduction DeNOx System and Aqueous Ammonia Storage and Delivery System\" as a basis.\n\n\n1.4.1  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n1. The accident history researched back to the SCR installation in 1996 shows that the facility has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of aqueous ammonia.  Should any reportable chemical incidents occur, the incidents would be noted in the RMP within 6 months of the date of the accident.\n\n\n1.4.2  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n1. A Process Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) have been conducted at the SBPP.  These activities produced the measures outlined below to improve safety at the facility.  The following recommendations were made and completed by December 31, 1999, except as noted:\n-The tank truck operator will be informed to shut down the tank truck pumps if the unloading overfills the storage tank and lifts the relief valves.\n-The in-service aqueous ammonia pumps will be shut down if the tank truck ammonia recirculation line is valved to return to the wrong tank causing the tank relief valves to lift.\n-Preventative maintenance will periodically exercise the threeway valves on the dual pressure relief valve assemblies.\n-Manufacturer's maintenance recommendations will be followed for the pressure relief valves.  This documentation will be kept in the Environmental Department files at the SBPP.\n-"

An Operator Guideline is available that addresses the emergency response procedure.\n-Options are continuing to be investigated since December 31, 1999 to allow visual detection of ammonia leaks in the secondary transfer piping between the storage facility and the vaporizers.\n-A plug or valve will be installed in the floor drain near the vaporizers.  The plug or valve will be opened only during rain, after it is confirmed that the ammonia system is not leaking.\n\n\nRev. 0.2, May 2004"
