There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.  CFPUA will continue to examine inherently safer technologies for this covered process.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific for the Plant. The Manual was issued to the plant and in 1999 the Manual was expanded to address the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP). The Manual continues to serve the Plant as the implementation and compliance tool for PSM and RMP.  Procedures have been updated to reflect current requirements.\n\n\n\nKey items included in the manual are:\n\n\n\n+ A written Management Program defining the positions and individuals responsible for implementing the RMP and PSM regulations\n\n\n\n+ Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits\n\n\n\n+ Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n\n\n+ Standard Operating Procedures for safe Chlorine Management\n\n\n\n+ A Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine equipment\n\n\n\n+ An Emergency Response Plan to address chlorine emergencies and offsite response and communication\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following steps have been continually implemented to maintain compliance with the RMP/PSM program.\n\n\n\n+ Training on RMP/PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and\n\nIncident Investigation;\n\n\n\n+ Conducting periodically Process Hazards Analyses for the two chlorine processes;\n\n\n\n+ Implementing the Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine regulators, controls and material handling equipment such as"

This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\n\n\n+ Chlorine leak detection alarm system allows for early detection and response to any chlorine leak.\n\n\n\nIn , the site Emergency Response Plan was revised to include offsite response and communication. Chlorine Response Drills have been routinely conducted since 1998. The hurricane/severe weather response plan has been in place for many years.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, an active safety program exists at the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, Wastewater Treatment Division (WWTD), and Section levels. The Wastewater Treatment Division Safety Committee incorporates two components a committee comprised of its supervisors and a committee composed of selected supervisors and subordinate staff members. The division conducts a monthly safety meeting on a regulatory subject or other specific wastewater safety issues. The Wastewater Treatment Division's three sections (Northside Operations, Southside Operations, and Wastewater Maintenance) meet several times each month to discuss safety topics of relevance and particular interest to their respective activities.\n\n\n\nThe WWTD safety program involves the following activities:\n\n\n\n+ Conducting accident reviews for responsibility/prevention/minimization;\n\n\n\n+ Conducting safety inspectio"
