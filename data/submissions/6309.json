Few residents were aware of the Lucas County LEPC and they were not familiar with the concept  shelter-in-place.  The communications group developed an LEPC brochure and folder, shelter-in-place refrigerator magnets, and individual facility brochures.   The media was briefed prior to a dinner given for briefing elected officials and emergency responders.   On May 15, 1999 the nine facilities set up informational booths at Franklin Park Mall"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nSince 1963, the City of Oregon Water Treatment Plant has used chlorine as part of its treatment process in providing safe drinking water to its consumers.  During those 36 years, we have never had an off site release.  We recognize that chlorine can be a hazardous chemical if safety precautions are not followed and we work very hard to protect our employees and our neighbors.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Water Plant is designed to treat 8 million gallons per day of water drawn in from Lake Erie.  The treatment plant is a lime-soda ash softening plant with rapid sand filters.  The chlorine is fed for disinfection  purposes from one ton containers.  The chlorine in the containers is in the liquid form under pressure and it is drawn off by vacuum as a gas.\n\nChlorine ton containers are transported to the plant by flat bed truck.  An overhead monorail lifts the containers off the truck and moves them to the storage building.  We receive three containers per shipment  approximately once per month.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nUsing the parameters specified by the EPA, and using the EPA\u0012s RMP Comp, it is determined that we would have an off site consequence should a chlorine leak occur outside our storage building.  We feel that the worst case scenario is very  unlikely since we get about one shipment per month and the chlorine containers  our outside our storage building only briefly during unloading.  The worst case scenario is assuming the if an accident occurs, no one intervenes, no safety systems operate, the weather conditions are the worst possible, and the steel container practically disintegrates.\n\nOur alternate scenario parameters would be a leaking container within our storage building.  A chlorine detector shuts down automatic exhaust systems as soon as a leak is detected.  Once the leak is contained  using a Class B repair kit, the room can be exhausted manually and any gas leaving the room can be spr"

It is the committee\u0012s responsibility to conduct the Process Hazard Analysis and implement, and review Operating Procedures and recommend modifications.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Diagrams and schematics are available and  employees have been trained and are familiar with the chlorination process.  Any new employee will be fully trained before they are expected to work with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The  Process Hazard Analysis is carried out by the Employee Participation Committee.  The overall process is evaluated,  and possible recommendations are discussed.  A schedule is set up with completion date assigned for each task.  Follow-up meetings are conducted to check on the progress of the items  to be implemented.  The checklist method was utilized.\n\nOperating Procedures - Operating procedures are documented using a standardized format.  Copies of procedures are given to all employees during classroom training and hands-on training.  Annually these procedures are reviewed by the Employee Participation Committee.  Any changes in procedures must follow the Management of Change requirements and  documentation  of the changes made on the Controlled  Documents.\n\nTraining - All new employees are given initial training  prior to working independently with the chlorine process.  Refresher training will be given at a minimum of every 3 years.  Maintenance/Operators will receive additional hands-on training relating to equipment repair and maintenance.  Records are kept of all training including the"
