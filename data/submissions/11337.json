This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.  This facility is inspected regularly by the Fire Marshall.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Waynesboro Fire Department and the Burke County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) for emergency response assistance.  Prior arrangements have been made with these agencies for emergency response assistance.\n\nThis facility is a bulk storage and retail propane facility.  There is a 12,000 gallon aboveground storage tank for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst Case Scenario (Toxics):  Tank failure of the 12,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank, resulting in the liquid spill and vaporization of approximately 61,651 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  According to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is calculated as 3.80 miles.  Depending on wind direction, this endpoint may include most of the city of Waynesboro.  Waynesboro has an estimated total population of 5,825.\n\nThere has never been an accident at this facility involving anhydrous ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  There are no planned changes to the safety procedures for this facility at this time."
