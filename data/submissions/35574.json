In 1998, Lyondell acquired the assets of ARCO Chemical Company (ACC), including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia (known as Kanawha Valley).  These facilities are located within the existing DOW Corporation?s South Charleston plant, and within the Bayer Crop Science plant in Institute. Also included in this acquisition were urethanes research and development facilities located within the DOW South Charleston Technical Center.  In 2000 Lyondell sold the Kanawha Valley manufacturing and research/development facilities to Bayer.\n\nWorldwide, the Lyondell enterprise operates in 15 countries, has approximately 11,000 employees, and consists of businesses with more than $17 billion in assets. \n\nPRODUCTS\n\nThe Lyondell enterprise produces quality chemicals, polymers, and refined petroleum products that form the basis for plastics and synthetics of all kinds.  Products made from these materials fill the supermarket shelves and go into automobiles, housing, clothing and other necessities that improve the quality of life by making products safer, healthier and more convenient.\n\nThe products made at our South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia facilities belong to a family of chemicals called polyether polyols, and are derived from a chemical called propylene oxide, which is supplied by other Lyondell plants on the Gulf Coast. Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat cushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels.

Other polyols products we make here are used by our customers for applications as diverse as roof coatings, varnishes, roller blade wheels, and bowling balls.  All of the products are shipped to customers in other states or are exported to Europe, Asia, and South America.\n\nAnother product from our West Virginia facilities is technology. The scientists and technicians at our South Charleston Technical Center work closely together with our manufacturing organization here to develop new or improved polyols products and process technologies. These new technologies can then be used by other Bayer polyol manufacturing sites around the world.\n\n\nRESPONSIBLE CARE?\n\nLyondell Chemical Company is fully committed to the principles of Responsible Care, which is an initiative of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) to improve industry performance in the areas of environment, health and safety, to improve the industry?s safe management of chemicals, and to respond to public concerns. Since acquiring these facilities in West Virginia, Since 1990, emissions of hazardous chemicals to the air from the Lyondell West Virginia facilities have been reduced by over 90% through improving processes and eliminating inefficient operations.  We have also made continuous improvements in our safety performance every year and rank among the industry leaders in this important aspect.  It is a policy of Lyondell to establish goals for continuous improvement in the areas of health, safety, and the environment based on sound science, risk assessment and benefit analysis, against which we will measure, audit and communicate our performance.\n\nAnother initiative for continuous improvement is called Manufacturing Excellence.  Manufacturing Excellence, launched in 1991, is a program of corporate standards which incorporates all of the Responsible Care?  codes and Lyondell?s own rigorous management s"

Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires that covered stationary sources handling regulated substances conduct off-site consequence analyses (OCA) to evaluate the potential off-site impact of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic chemical on site.  RMP also requires covered sources to evaluate one worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario for a single chemical representing the class of flammables.  \n\nAll of these scenarios are developed using guidelines established in the RMP rule.  In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.

They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\n\nEPA?s Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance. The EPA-recommended LANDVIEW program was used to estimate the number of people potentially affected in each scenario.  The West Virginia Kanawha/Putnam County Emergency Services Maps and CD-ROM Program were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the scenario endpoint distance.\n\nAccording to the RMP rule, the release endpoint distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected for each scenario.  It is intended to ensure that potential risks to the public health are recognized.  For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.   For flammable releases, the endpoint distance is that distance beyond which the community would be subject to a pressure wave of less than 1 psi resulting from the formation of an exploding vapor cloud.  Below this value little or no impact to the community is expected.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case and alternative case scenarios in our facility Risk Management Plans.

It also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC).    \n\nThe South Charleston Plant, which provides emergency response services to the North Charleston Distribution Terminal, maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The South Charleston Plant emergency response program includes all of the details from the North Charleston Distribution Terminal, and provisions to handle the hazards at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\n? Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures \n? Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n? Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n? Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n? Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\nThe South Charleston Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.   The plant emergency squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.   Criti"

In addition to the plant emergency squad, DOW staffs a Hazardous Emergency Leak Prevention (HELP) team  in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases within the North Charleston Distribution Terminal and from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States.  \n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n? A new Corporate program designed to ensure that process safety information is maintained evergreen.\n? Continue use and implementation of the Apollo Root Cause Analysis problem solving technique to investigate incidents, to identify causes of process problems, and to develop  effective solutions to prevent their recurrence.\n? Continue to implement the storage tank and piping repainting program to protect against corrosion, weathering and rust. \n? Replacement of Propylene Oxide header piping sections.  This will eliminate older piping. \n? Add redundant relays, controls and switches to some existing unit instrumentation.\n? Additional piping supports in areas identified by process hazard analyses and by the piping vibration analysis program.\n? Upgrade and replace process safety valves and relief valves to improve process safety capability. \n? Upgrade to emergency response computer database to improve ability to calculate release quantities and to increase reference data to improve emergency response capability\n? Annual testing, inspection, and replacement of flexible transfer hoses at the Propylene Oxide Barge Unloading Station"
