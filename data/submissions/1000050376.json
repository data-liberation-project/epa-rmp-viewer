Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nThe Premier Foam plant believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, is the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to:\r\n\r\nComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.  Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental improvements.\r\n\r\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Our plant manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our plant manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the plant manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and intregration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of Premier Foam plant is to produce flexible polyurethane foam for bedding and furniture applications.  The foam is made by high-shear mixing of chemicals as they are poured on a conveyor.  The conveyor pulls the reacting mixture away from the mixhead.  The foam rises and reacts to make flexible polyurethane foam buns.\r\n\r\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program rule, is one of the reactants"

      "SummaryText": "required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by tanker truck, and is stored in a storage tank located within containment walls.  The TDI is transferred to the foam process by pump.\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount of TDI stored on-site is 390,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3.  Off-site consequence analysis scenarios\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenario's for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\r\n\r\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint as established by the RMP rule was ALOHA model.  Since this facility is considered Program 1, worst-case release scenario will only be discussed.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario\r\nCatastrophic failure of the storage tank full of TDI, discharging its entire contents of 385,101 pounds, to the secondary containment.  The free surface area within the diking is 1381 sq.ft.  The TDI temperature was assumed to be 90F, and the ambient temperature was 100F.  The ALOHA model was used to estimate the emissions and distance to endpoint for atmospheric class F and wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The distance to endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L is 0.025 miles, or 44 yards.  There are no pubic receptors within this boundary.\r\n\r\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  We have an established Isocyanate Control program that outlines the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls, which are in place to reduce the hazards of isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community and the environment.\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year accident history\r\n\r\nThe Premier Foam plant has not had any TDI releases that qualify for listing in the EPA's required five"

The emergency response program.\r\n\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provided essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  Since our LEPC and SERP are the same, we have coordinated our program with the local fire department.  A representative group from the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI."
