Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Clean Air Act. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland staff is highly trained and utilize equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is located at 1785 East Beamer St., Woodland, California in the county of Yolo. The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n\n\nThe facility does not carry anhydrous ammonia for distribution onsite, however, 1,000-gallon nurse tanks that are returned from the field are stored onsite.  The used nurse tanks that are stored at the facility typically contain a small amount of residual anhydrous ammonia in them, approximately 250-gallons at most.  At one time the facility may have as many as 6 nurse tanks onsite, each containing a maximum of 250-gallons (1,166 lb) of anhydrous ammonia for a total maximum quantity onsite of 7,000 lb.\n\n\n\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 25,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The total quantity "

Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \n\n\n\n-Risk Considerations\n\n\n\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\n\n   -The history of the Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is no more than 7,000 lb.  Therefore, the process does not exceed the 10,000 lb threshold quantity for EPA RMP.  The 500 lb state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program is exceeded.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 but not a covere"

Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lb threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 24% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantity of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%.
