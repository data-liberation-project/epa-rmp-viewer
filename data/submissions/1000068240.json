In the course of manufacturing these products, flammable and toxic materials as defined in the Risk Management Planning (RMP) list of chemicals are utilized and stored in greater than threshold quantities.  Although there have been no incidents associated with SI Group operations, the RMP regulations require these materials to conform to Program 3 requirements.  Thus a Hazard Analysis, a prevention program, and an Emergency Response Program are in place for all RMP materials on site.\n\n\n\nSI Group has established a strong, comprehensive safety program.  This includes process safety, employee health and safety, and emergency action plans that provide a strong and effective prevention and remediation program to minimize the risk of SI Group's operations.  The process safety program was developed based upon the requirements contained in the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, the EPA Risk Management regulations, and the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Code of Management Practices.  The program is reviewed and modified to continually improve its effectiveness and in turn SI Group's safety performance.  Process safety along with employee health and safety programs have been in place for many years and are a result of a corporate culture that continues to commit significant resources to ensure that its operations pose a minimum risk to workers, the community, and the environment.  SI Group's Orangeburg facility is RC14001 certified, Palmetto Star VPP certified, ISO9001 certified, and CTPAT certified.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenarios represent very low probability events and in some cases are scientifically infeasible.  The RMP regulations require the worst case scenarios principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for local emergency pla"

Although worst cases scenarios are required by the regulations to promote a creative dialog, the EPA does not expect industry to consider these events for the purpose of emergency response planning.\n\nThe worst case scenarios for all RMP materials at SI Group's facility would have endpoints off site.  This did, as expected by the EPA, prompt an evaluation of the tanks and transportation containers to assure that the worst case events conform to the EPA's assumption, i.e., that these events are improbable and actually represent events that would never be expected to occur.  The requirement for RMP materials was evaluated; however, the demands of the production units make storing some materials on site above the threshold quantity a necessity.  Based on this evaluation, it was concluded that storage quantities have been minimized and that SI Group's worst case scenarios are all highly improbable or infeasible.\n\nThe alternate release scenarios for toxic and flammable materials would have end points off site but well within the area covered by SI Group's emergency response plan.  SI Group has for many years maintained an effective emergency response system consisting of community sirens, trained response personnel, 24-hour a day command center and a fully equipped alternate command center which can respond to any of the alternate release scenarios and other emergency situations.\n\n\n\nAlthough SI Group has never experienced an event that had an effect off site, it has for many years coordinated its emergency response plans with community response agencies and personnel.  SI Group communicates with the public the significance of the siren system by annual mailings of calendars.  The community siren system is tested monthly and the plant alarm system is tested four times per week. The command center personnel perform a weekly test of the equipment to include contacting the local response agency and also receive annual refresher training."
