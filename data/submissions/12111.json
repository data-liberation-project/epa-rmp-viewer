The plan, included within Padre Dam Municipal Water District's Risk Management Plan, has been developed and designed with the following in consideration:\n\nThe WRF's plan is designed to provide the following:  \n\n1.  \tTo protect the lives of the Water Reclamation Facility staff, support activities related to release prevention and mitigation, and to protect ANY public receptors within the toxic endpoints of an accidental release.\n\n2.  \tFor the purpose of mitigating all potential releases from the Facility and to prevent  injuries.\n\n3.  \tTo minimize damage to property and to the surrounding environment\t\n\nPadre Dam Municipal Water District has taken on an aggressive hazardous materials emergency response training program to prevent any potential releases from the Water Reclamation Facility. This activity has included the purchase and outfitting of a 16' Hazmat emergency response trailer which contains all the tools and communication equipment necessary for an effective response a chemical release, a quarterly training program on emergency responses to hazardous material releases, and a quarterly hazardous materials emergency response drill coordinated with the Santee Fire Department, the City of San Diego Hazmat Unit and the County of San Diego Hazmat Unit.  \n\nAll  personnel actively participate with the safety training and planning for the facility.  The\nWater Reclamation's Hazardous Materials Business Plan as well as the  safety plan provides the personnel organization and notification needed to effectively attend to Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide chemical release issues.  The Emergency Response Plan identifies health hazards and\nmitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively should an emergency\nsituation ar"

The safety committee reviews documents related to the operation of the WRF facility including the Hazardous Materials Business Plan.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nPadre Dam Municipal Water District, Water Reclamation Facility began operation in 1967.  The address of the Facility is 12001 North Fanita Parkway, Santee, CA 92071.\n\nThe Facility used Chlorine injection until 1975, when it was discontinued due to a change in processes.    Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide were re-introduced to the facility in 1996/97 as a result of an upgrade and expansion of the Facility to a 2 MGD Wastewater treatment facility.  The Facility treats wastewater to Title 22 reclaimed water standards for distribution into a reclaimed water system within the Santee region.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are fed through a system consisting of one-ton containers which are the storage vessels for chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide gas are\ndrawn from a maximum of one tank at a time through a vacuum regulator to the Chlorinators and Sulfur Dioxide injectors.   Still under vacuum from the Chlorinators and the Sulfur Dioxide injectors, the gas is drawn to injection pumps and mixed with water for distribution through-out the wastewater treatment plant.  Maximum chlorine stored at facility is 5 one-ton\ncylinders for a total of 10,000 pounds.  Maximum Sulfur Dioxide stored at the Facility is 4 one-ton cylinders for a total of 8,000 pounds.\n\t\nHazardous Assessment Summary\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScena"

Because sulfur dioxide gas is nearly identical in physical properties to chlorine and is stored and feed in identical cylinders as Chlorine, same safety  practices are used for sulfur dioxide.  In addition to plant safety program for the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, there are chlorine gas detectors in the chlorine storage and feeding rooms that detect chlorine at the level of 1 ppm and will activate a visual/audible alarm and scrubber system.   In the sulfur dioxide storage room, there are sulfur dioxide gas detectors as well as in the feeding rooms that detect sulfur dioxide at the level of 1 ppm and will activate a visual/audible alarm, scrubber system and water mist sprinkler knockdown system.  \n\nThe entire chemical feed system at the facility is tied into a Factory Link - NT computer system(s) that monitors and operates the facility.  In the event of an accidental release, detected by either activation of a scrubber or a sensor within the storage buildings,   WRF personnel are notified by auto-dial pager systems.   The system operates 24hrs a day and is tested on a daily basis.
