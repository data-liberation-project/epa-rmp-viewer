      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n\nThe USEPA?s Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. The plan must also include mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact on the public in the unlikely event of a release. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake & Sandy (the District) supplies drinking water on a wholesale basis to Salt Lake City, Sandy City and other water supply agencies in the Salt Lake County area. The District operates and maintains facilities in Wasatch County, Utah County and Salt Lake County. The Little Cottonwood Water Treatment Plant is a 115 million gallon per day treatment facility which treats water from Little Cottonwood Creek and the Deer Creek Reservoir. The District?s Little Cottonwood Water Treatment Plant (LCWTP) stores chlorine in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP/PSM is required. Chlorine is used at the LCWTP to disinfect the drinking water prior to public consumption. The District has voluntarily installed a chlorine scrubber to operate in the event of a chlorine leak. If a leak occurs, the chlorine scrubber will treat the chlorine in a manner that should not pose a threat to the outside environment. \n\nThe District takes safety very seriously and has not had a reportable incident related to chlorine since June 21, 1994.\n\nThe RMP/PSM consists of three compliance programs, each with progressively stricter compliance standards. Since the District is a political subdivision of the State of Utah, State and federal OSHA regulations do not expressly apply.  However, the District is required by the Utah Labor Code to operate and maintain an occupation"

      "SummaryText": "al safety and health program equivalent to the program for other employers in the state.  The District generally does this by looking to OSHA regulations for guidance, subject to the District's ability to independently make decisions which best meet its safety needs.  Consistent with this approach the District has chosen to use the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards as a guide.  For this reason, and the fact that a worst-case release of chlorine could affect the public, the chlorination process at LCWTP will be treated as subject to Program 3, the most stringent of the three programs.\n\nThe RMP/PSM consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment, which evaluates the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public and is not included in this executive summary for security reasons. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the RMP and PSM regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program for the EPA RMP also serve as a substantively equivalent OSHA PSM plan.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, make up the RMP/PSM. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe participation of the District staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program?s successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff?s experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\n\nDistrict staff participated in the development of the Prevention "

The operations and maintenance staff also participated in the development of the RMP by reviewing and commenting on operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices; these personnel will continue to review and update these practices and procedures on a regular basis.  All District staff received RMP/PSM awareness training that instructed staff on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs. Staff who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM processes were trained in how to safely maintain and operate the processes.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information will be supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element. All the required process safety information was compiled as required by the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted to systematically evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information was used by District staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine process.\n\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of District staff familiar with the process operation and maintenance and plant management. The PHA was done using a combination of ?What-If? and ?Checklist? methods. Based on the results of the PHAs, numerous changes in operating, maintenance, and other"

The changes that most affect the severity and likelihood of a release have been adopted by the District and incorporated as part of the overall Process Safety Management Program. The other improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards will be reviewed and scheduled to be implemented or incorporated as appropriate.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOperating procedures for the chlorination process have been updated as part of the RPM/PSM. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\n\nThe detailed operating procedures include startup, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. The procedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\nTRAINING\n\nAn effective RMP/PSM training program can significantly reduce the number and severity of accidental release incidences. Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorination process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.\n\nDistrict staff have received initial training on the operations and maintenance of the regulated processes, an overview of each of the RMP/PSM plan elements, and the procedures that must be followed to comply with the requirements of the RMP/PSM plan. In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, select District staff have been trained to respond to an accidental release."

In addition, the District makes contractors aware of the applicable elements of its emergency response plan. The District considers the contractors? ability to perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine process without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility in the selection process. \n\nBefore allowing a contractor to work on or adjacent to the chlorine process, the District obtains and evaluates information regarding the contractor?s safety performance and programs. When a contract involving work on or adjacent to the chlorine process is to be bid, the bidding procedures ensure that contractor safety management requirements are met. If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any covered processes, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the District?s RMP/PSM plan requirements, is conducted before work begins. Upon arriving at the plant for the first time to perform work, the contractor will be presented a Contractor Safety Management Briefing Form that must be read and signed. All contractors should receive an Emergency Response Summary Sheet. \n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new covered process or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine process that necessitate a change in the process safety information. No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review.

This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed. The Pre-startup Safety Review Form must be authorized before startup.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release. The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\n\nThe District maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system, referred to as the Preventative Maintenance (PMC) to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance, provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. The PMC system is used to generate work orders for preventative maintenance. In addition to preventative maintenance, the District staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lockout/tagout or confined space entry provisions are applicable. The staff that carryout maintenance are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM.\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing ?hot work? in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before any hot work is perfor"

Following the standards outline in this section aid in complying with the OSHA Hot Works Regulations (1910.252(a)).\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nA system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions is required under the RMP/PSM. Modifications to the chlorine process will be reviewed before they are implemented to evaluate if the modification would compromise system safety. An effective change management system will help minimize the chance for an accidental release.\n\nIf a modification covered under RMP/PSM is made, its effects must be addressed, employees must be informed, and the written procedures must be updated. The intent is to require that all modifications to equipment, procedures, and processing conditions other than ?replacement in kind? be managed by identifying and reviewing them before implementation. A Management of Change Committee will evaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM. The Management of Change Committee will complete a Management of Change Form that the Operations and Maintenance Manager will review and authorize prior to initiation of a covered change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes.\n\n"

A determination will be made as to whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees to prevent the incident from occurring in the future. On the incident report form, the Operations and Maintenance Manager identifies which of the recommended system changes are approved for implementation. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system. \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\n\nThe District is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP/PSM program. The primary goals of conducting an internal compliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify compliance with RMP/PSM requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among District staff.\n\nThe compliance audit methodology is modeled after OSHA?s guidelines for conducting regulatory PSM compliance audits: Compliance Guidelines and Enforcement Procedures, OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A CH-1 (September 13, 1994). An internal compliance audit must be conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years for the chlorine process. A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered processes and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP/PSM requirements and audit techniques will conduct the audits. The Operations and Maintenance Manager and the audit team will promptly determine an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and document the corrective actions and the dates by which they must be taken.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program documents a plan for dealing with a release"

      "SummaryText": ". OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119(n) and EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR 68 Subpart E require that an Accidental Release Emergency Response Plan be prepared. The plan must be prepared in accordance with the provisions of another overlapping OSHA regulation?Employee Emergency Plans (29 CFR 1910.38(a)). In addition, provisions of the OSHA hazardous waste and emergency response standard, 29 CFR 1910.120 (q), must also be considered. The Emergency Planning and Response Plan described in this section complies with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, 29 CFR 1910.38(a), and 29 CFR 1910.120(q). \n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response plan , ?Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake & Sandy Facility Emergency Response Plan?, provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental release of chlorine. The emergency response procedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through either leak stoppage or HAZMAT assistance. As part of the emergency response procedures there are plans for victim rescue, leak investigation, and communication with additional support agencies. In addition, critical plant operations are identified to insure that, if possible, the critical District functions are kept operational. The Emergency Planning and Response plan also indicates the level of training needed to carryout the emergency response procedures. Only personnel trained at the Hazardous Materials Technician Level can attempt to stop a leak. The emergency response procedures also covers situations where plant evacuation is necessary.\n\nInformation regarding self contained breathing apparatus is also provided in the Emergency Planning and Response plan. It also addresses plant site communication, emergency response equipment, first aid and medical treatment, medical surveillance and consultation, and emergency response drills."
