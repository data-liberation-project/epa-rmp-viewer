      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\n\nThe Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of ammonia and chlorine.  The amounts stored for both chemicals are well above the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Elm Fork WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) Plan that contains the following required information: \n\n7 A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n\n7 A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n\n7 A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n\n7 An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the Elm Fork WTP.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Elm Fork WTP facility in Carrollton, Texas has an excellent record in preventing"

      "SummaryText": "and minimizing releases of ammonia and chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.  The plant staff will receive training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of the City of Dallas HAZMAT team\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Elm Fork WTP uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  The Elm Fork WTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 205 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in two DOT certified 90-ton rail cars and an emergency storage tank.  The storage tank has a capacity to store 30 tons of chlorine, but only 25 tons are stored in the tank based on administrative controls.  This total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  In addition to the chlorine stored onsite, the Elm Fork WTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 34 tons of ammonia stored in stationary tanks.  The ammonia is stored in two storage tanks, each with a capacity to store 20 tons.  However, only 17 tons are stored in each tank based on administrative controls.  This total amount of ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds set by the USEPA. \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Elm Fork WTP receives raw water from the Elm Fork of the Trinity River into the treatment plant located at 1440 Whitlock Lane, Carrollton, Texas.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  \nThe existing chlorine feed facilities at the Elm Fork WTP consist of (1) inside storage tanks (two 90-ton rail cars and one 30-ton emergency tank), (2) liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, (3) three evaporators, (4) gas piping and miscellaneous valves, (5) three chlorina"

A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area (items 1 and 2 above) and the chlorine process areas (items 3 through 6 above). \n\nThe majority of chlorine is delivered to the Elm Fork WTP by railroad on rail spurs and is stored in two 90-ton railroad cars, located at the Chlorine and Ammonia Building.  A chlorine tanker truck supplies the emergency tank, when necessary.  Chlorine is removed as a liquid under pressure from a rail car or from the emergency tank.  Chlorine is withdrawn from one tank car at a time through a flexible metal connection.  As the supply in one rail car empties, the supply is manually switched to the full tank car. The emergency tank is only used if no chlorine is available in either of the rail cars, which is a rare occurrence.\nThe liquid chlorine is pumped through a flexible reinforced hose to three chlorine evaporators located in the chlorine evaporator room. The chlorine gas generated by the evaporators is then transferred to the chlorinators that feed either to a vault leading to the rapid mix basins (pre chlorination) or to the filter outlet (post chlorination).   \n\nThe existing ammonia feed facilities at the Elm Fork WTP consist of (1) two 20-ton stationary tanks, (2) liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, (3) evaporators, (4) gas piping and miscellaneous valves, (5) ammoniators, and (6) an ammonia scrubber system.

The USEPA requires that a single worst-case release scenario for the facility and one alternate release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario that creates the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint offsite involves a chlorine release.  The largest potential release of chlorine would occur through an angle valve failure on the 90-ton rail car located on the north side of the plant.  This valve failure could potentially release all 90 tons of chlorine as a gas.  Under Section 68.25(c)(1), the release time for a chemical such as chlorine is 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls were not applicable to the worst-case release at this plant.\n \nThe EPA-approved modeling program DEGADIS+ was used to characterize the effects of the worst-case release scenario at the Elm Fork facility.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 5.69 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 140,000 people.  Commercial, industrial and residential areas would be affected in the worst-case release scenario.\n \nAlternate Scenarios\n\nOne alternate release scenario for chlorine was modeled for the Elm Fork WTP and did not involve any form of mitigation.  The scenario involved a release through a 1/8-inch hole created by a leak in the packing valve on the rail car that is occasionally stored outside.  It was assumed that the leak duration was 120 minutes, the time between operator rounds, thereby creating a release rate of 30 pounds per minute.  DEGADIS+ was used to characterize the effects"

The estimated affected residential population is 1,500 people.  \n\nAn alternate release scenario for ammonia was also modeled for the Elm Fork WTP and did not involve any form of mitigation.  The release could occur while the ammonia tanks were being filled.  The tank truck could drift, causing the fill line to break.  A release of ammonia through a 1-inch diameter hole would last for about 10 minutes, resulting in a release rate of 30 pounds per minute.  DEGADIS+ was also used to characterize the effects of this alternate release scenario.  The distance to the USEPA defined toxic endpoint of 200 ppm was determined to be 1.24 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 4,600 people.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Elm Fork WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine and ammonia equipment, utilizing only fully trained personnel in these areas.  Elm Fork WTP management ensures consistent operation by using disciplinary measures for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history for the Elm Fork WTP was reviewed for the period from June 1994 through June 1999.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia had occurred.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are five in-plant contacts for an emergency, the Operations Supervisor and the Shift Supervisors.  Back-up personnel are available in the event that the primary response personnel cannot be contacted.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of either an ammonia or chlorine emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, and"

The most notable planned changes include the following:\n\n7 While the Elm Fork WTP does have a chlorine scrubber, it is not designed to meet the current Uniform Fire Codes.  Therefore, the chlorine scrubber design is planned to be upgraded to meet the current standards.   Also, the establishment of a procedure to routinely test the concentration of the scrubbing solution should be considered.  These tests would ensure that the solution strength is adequate to scrub the contaminated air;\n\n7 Elm Fork WTP management is considering adding remote chlorine sensors and alarms below the rail car spotting site. The consideration of outside leak detection is tied to the periodic need for railcars containing chlorine to be situated outside of the building.  This situation occurs periodically because of the inefficient delivery from the railroad.  Given that extra cars may be spotted outside, the installation of a leak detection system should ensure the detection of any leaks;\n\n7 Ensure that the delivery drivers follow set procedures when delivering either ammonia or chlorine.  MW will coordinate with the staff to develop a procedure to govern the activities of the truck driver or vendor while on plant grounds.  It is anticipated that the vendor can then be subjected to this procedure at the time of the plant's next bid for chemical purchase.  The existing vendor will likely accept these requirements voluntarily to ensure customer satisfaction;\n\n7 Consider the need for automatic kill switches on the"

Remote switches also eliminate the danger of plant personnel having to manually shutdown the chlorine and ammonia systems;\n\n7 Consider acquiring emergency response equipment and training for on-site personnel to decrease response times; \n\n7 Consider exercising the expansion chamber valves in the chlorine and ammonia storage areas periodically.  If this is done, the valves would be exercised regularly and any malfunctions could be detected and repaired before an accident could occur;\n\n7 Evaluate the need to establish a procedure for inspecting and maintaining the rupture disks and tanks in the chlorine and ammonia storage areas.  The current procedure is to replace the equipment as needed.  While this procedure may be adequate, the implementation of a new procedure could help to prevent any major releases; and\n\n7 Consider the need to establish a procedure for routine inspection and maintenance of the ventilation systems.  Currently, only periodic visual inspections of the ductwork are performed at the Elm Fork WTP; however, no set procedure has been established for these inspections.  The implementation of a procedure could help prevent an ineffective use of the scrubber during an emergency."
