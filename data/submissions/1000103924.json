Emergency Drills at the facility are conducted quarterly, with different scenarios to include a possible unexpected hydrogen release.\n\nAirgas also has an Emergency Response Organization called AERO that consists of trained HazMat Technicians on call 24/7 that would respond to emergency situations at a facility. The nearest AERO team to this facility is located five miles away at our Laporte, TX - Miller Cut Off Road location and consists of 10 trained employees. There are two additional teams in the region that can also provide support as needed. If the situation cannot be handled by our AERO team, local first responders will be contacted to help handle the situation. \n\nThe Area Operations Manager that is assigned to the Fairmont Pkwy location and a local Region Safety & Compliance Specialist regularly attend and participate in the local LEPC meetings to represent Airgas, network with government officials, first responders, and industry members, and to provide information back to our company in terms of emergency planning and preparedness. First responders have been regularly invited to tour our facility to help them understand our processes and hazards.\n\nBased on the results of our most recent Process Risk Analysis (PRA), we will be adding additional safeguards to help improve the safety at the facility and a Region Safety & Compliance Specialist has been assigned to help the facility manage the EPA/RMP requirements and compliance."

      "SummaryText": "The Laporte, TX Fairmont Pkwy facility is managed by Airgas USA, LLC - Gulf Coast Region.\n\nThe hydrogen fill system at the facility involves both bulk trailer and cylinder filling of hydrogen.  Hydrogen is a flammable gas with an atmospheric pressure boiling point of -423 degrees F.  The hydrogen is stored as a liquid at a pressure of approximately 70 psi in a vacuum-insulated cryogenic storage vessel.  At ambient temperatures it is stored as a gas in cylinders and tubes at pressures up to 2750 psig.  \n\nLiquid hydrogen is delivered by tank truck and transferred to a 20,000 gallon cryogenic storage vessel that is maintained through administrative controls at a maximum volume of 18,000 gallons or 10,631 lbs.  This liquid hydrogen is ultra-high purity (UHP) grade and used for specialty applications in customers' processes.  The UHP hydrogen liquid is gravity fed through a set of vaporizers or heat exchangers that allows the liquid to expand into a gas.  The gas is then piped to two hydrogen compressors that pump the hydrogen through purification filters and up to three cylinder fill panels and five tube trailer stanchions.  \n\nThe maximum possible inventory of hydrogen on-hand at the facility is 17,415 lbs.  That amount is a combination of the full cryogenic storage vessel and the maximum number of receptacles onsite and in the full state at the same time.  This max includes seven jumbo tube trailers (140,000scf), four smaller tube trailers (48,000scf), in addition to five hundred size 300 cylinders (261scf).\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of hydrogen in the past five years at this facility. \n\nTo prevent accidental release, the entire hydrogen fill system (both compressed and liquefied gases) has been installed in accordance with the NFPA 55: Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code as well as ANSI/Compressed Gas Association (CGA) industry standards.  The facility also follows the OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nBoth the facility and the region also have policies in"
