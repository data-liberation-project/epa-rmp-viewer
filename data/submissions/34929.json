FACILITY POLICY\n\nThe owner, management, and employees of Golden Rod Broilers, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release did occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Cullman County LEPC or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impadct of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe primary activity of the facility is the processing of poultry.\n\nChlorine is received in 1 ton cylinders (from 1-5 on site at any one time) and is used to treat the inlet water to the process water treatment plant.   Approximately usage rate is 100-300 #/day.\n\nAmmonia is used as a refrigerant to cool the poultry parts after processing.  There are two separate but identical systems, each containing approximately 12,000 gallons of liquid anhydrous ammonia.  Make-up ammonia to the system is brought to the plant  1 to 2 times/ year.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the rupture and release of the total contents of a one ton cylinder of chlorine within a 10 minute time period (at either water treatment plant or wastewater plant).  The maximum quanity released would be 2000 pounds and the distance to the toxic end point is 3.0 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine is a break or major leak in the process piping (tubing) from the cylinder to the injector.  This would result in a potential release of approximately 600 #'s over a 60 minute period.  The distance to the end point is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for ammonia is a broken glass sight gauge on the outside surge vessel.  This would result in a potentail release of about 2,250 #'s over a 45 minute peroid.  The distance to the end point is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe backbone of the release prevention program is a co-ordinated operations and maintenance program that obse"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases involving chlorine at the facility that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evaculations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases involving ammonia at the facility tha caused deaths, injuries,  property or environmental damage, or off-site evaculations.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has has a written emergency response program and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  \n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility is upgrading it's PSM programs for both chlorine and ammonia.  Increased employee input and participation on operation and maintenance is being solicited.  Remote monitoring devices for chlorine and ammonia are being considered to reduce the estimated response time to the alternative release scenerios."
