The Wastewater Plant currently treats an average of\n3.5 MGD and uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant in the treatment process.  The City uses\napproximately 60 pounds per day of chlorine.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes ton chlorine\ncylinders manifolded in pairs with a backup pair to provide the supply chlorine. Additionally, the\nPlants stores up to two reserve non-connected cylinders to replace chlorine cylinders in service as\nthey are depleted.  Typically no more than 12,000 pounds of chlorine will be on the site at any time.\n\nThe City of Pulaski Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Program in\nan attempt to identify all possible chemical emergencies which may occur and the best way to\nprevent the accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere from the plant's chlorination facilities. \nThe City Personnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination\nequipment conduct their work with the upmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the\ndangers involved with chlorine.  The City places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters.  \n\nIn addition to the Risk Management Plan, the City of Pulaski is subject to OSHA Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) regulations.  The City is working with Tennessee OSHA to develop and\nimplement an approved PSM plan for chlorine.  This has been coordinated with the Giles County\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Pulaski Safety Board to assure that all entities\nare aware of the possible dangers involved in a chlorine leak from the Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n\nThe City has developed a written operations manual, emergency response plan and emergency action\nplan as a part of the OSHA PSM plan.

Additional safety measures are installed\nin the form of ventilators and chlorine leak detectors which assist in the notification and protection\nof emergency personnel in the event of a leak.  Since the Wastewater Treatment Plant is only\nmanned 8 hours a day, the City of Pulaski has incorporated an autodialer into the chlorine alarm\nsystem to notify personnel of leaks which occur after hours.\n\nThe emergency response plan outlines the proper procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine leak\ndetection.  Upon detection of the leak, the plant supervisor will notify the emergency service\ncoordinator as defined in the City of Pulaski's Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate assistance\nwith outside emergency units.  The cause of the leak will then be determined so that appropriate\nactions may be taken to insure public safety.  The City of Pulaski Fire Department will act as\nstandby rescue personnel for the plant operators while an attempt to stop the chlorine leak is made. \nThe fire department personnel will be familiarized with the chlorine system so as to assure that, if\nnecessary, they may be able to isolate the leak and stop it.  The Emergency Service Coordinator will\nwork with the Pulaski Police Department and other personnel to alert nearby residents to remove to\nsafety if the need arises.  Local radio stations may also be utilized to notify the public of the\nemergency condition and what to do.  To date, the City of Pulaski has had no major accidental\nreleases of chlorine which required action involving off-site receptors.  There have been no\naccidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the Risk Management Plan was evaluated as a rupture of a full ton\nchlorine cylinder and release of its contents to the atmosphere.
