No mitgation is assumed.  This release has off-site impact as determined by use of the EPA OCA Guidance.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SECNARIO\n\n     The worst-case release scenario for a flammable regulated substance is a failure of a storage tank containing dimethylamine.  No mitigation is assumed.  This release, if ignited, has off-site impact as determined by use of the EPA OCA Guidance and by computer modeling.\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     There are five toxic regulated substance in the RMP.  These are anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde solution, oleum, phosgene, and sulfur trioxide.  No mitigation is assumed in assessing off-site impact, except for the oleum release, which is contained in a dike.
