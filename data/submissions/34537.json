              "Description": "LBC Houston is a public bulk liquid storage & transfer facility for chemicals, oils, and petroleum products. Regulated toxics and flammable liquids are stored in atmospheric storage tanks. Some products such as Propylene Oxide is stored in atmospheric tanks and refrigerated for product quality and vapor pressure requirements. Storage tanks and associated transfer equipment are constructed to API, ASME, NFPA, and ANSI standards.Mechanical integrity and other inspections are performed periodically as per the standard. MSDS' are required for product storage and a review is performed upon receipt of the MSDS. This review includes equipment specifications, storage tank allowable inventory, compatibility, emission control requirements, and any special handling requirements.All storage tanks are calibrated and a \"safe fill\" is determined as the maximun inventory. All electrical equipment meets ANSI electrical codes for flammable service. A hazard review is performed for regulated toxics and flammables using the safety information and storage tank equipment. Basic operating procedures are maintained although some products have product specific procedures. The maintenance department has a preventative maintenance program to maintain equipment integrity and safe operating conditions. A comprehensive training program is maintained. This prgram includes but not limited to hazard communication, DOT, hazwoper, cpr/first-aid, employee emergency plans, personal protective equipment,confined space requirements, etc.",

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors, and protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities at LBC Houston including:\nA description of our facility and the storage and transfer of chemicals.\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention program.\nA five year accidental release history for regulated chemicals.\nAn overview of our emergency response program.\nAn overview of planned and implemented improvements to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE \n\nLBC Houston is a public bulk liquid storage and transfer facility. We are not a manufacturing or processing plant. Chemicals, oils, and petroleum products are stored and transferred via tank trucks, rail cars, barges, and ships. There is a number of regulated toxic and flammable chemicals which we are permitted (facility air permit based on health effects) to store but do not presently have on site. Therefore we are using predictive filing to include some regulated chemicals that are not on site but could be in the future. A majority of the regulated flammable chemicals are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nOur accidental release prevention program ia a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\nProcess safety information\nProcess hazard analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nPre-startup review\nCompliance audits\nIncident investigation\nEmplo"
