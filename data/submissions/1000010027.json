These systems are designed to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  Commonwealth Agri-Energy also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its system components to ensure they are in good operating condition.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving ammonia at this facility since production began. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy has implemented an Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.

The facility began production in the spring of 2004.  \n\nThe facility\u00c2\u00bfs full production capacity is approximately 10 million bushels of corn & wheat grown within the Hopkinsville area.  Annually the plant will produce 33 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol plus another 100,000 tons of distiller\u00c2\u00bfs dry grains (DDG\u00c2\u00bfS).\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy is subject to RMP regulations due to the storage of ammonia in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\nChemical Management Program\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Commonwealth Agri-Energy is located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  The facility is operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  The plant\u00c2\u00bfs safety program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Commonwealth Agri-Energy\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Environmental and Safety Coordinators.  Additionally, regular safety meetings are conducted to discuss a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training issues.\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy currently has one (1) process that contains a regulated substance covered by EPA\u00c2\u00bfs 40 CFR Part 68 (anhydrous ammonia).\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances - Anhydrous Ammonia\nAmmonia is used to control pH in initial stages of the ethanol production process.  Ammonia is added"
