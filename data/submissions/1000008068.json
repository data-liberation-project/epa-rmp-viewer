Each year, the company reports the amount of hazardous chemicals used and/or released to the environment to state and/or federal regulatory agencies. \n\nOur Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJohn Morrell & Co. is a pork processing (meatpacking) plant located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The facility employs about 3,000 people to kill and process about 16,000 pigs per day.  The facility cuts and packages fresh pork as well as manufactures sausage, bologna, bacon, ham and other processed meats.  The facility utilizes various conveyor systems and state-of-the-art processing, cooking and packaging equipment.  Various sanitation chemicals are stored and used for cleaning the facility in strict accordance with USDA food safety regulations.\n\nThe facility has a total of two regulated substances under the PSM and RMP programs.  They are ammonia,and chlorine.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the processing plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas.  This type of ammonia is also used as a crop nutrient and is commonly sprayed on fields by farmers.  Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.  Over 390,000 pounds of ammonia is in the refrigeration system throughout the plant. There are two ammonia systems for the facility, one for the main processing plant and the other for the distribution warehouse.\n\nThe facility also has it's own wastewater treatment plant.  The wastewater facility utilizes screens to recover course material, dissolved air flotation tanks to recover grease, anaerobic lagoons and aeration basins to b"

Chlorine is then added to disinfect the water followed by the addition of sodium bisulfite to remove any residual chlorine prior to discharging the treated water to the Big Sioux River in accordance with a permit.\n\nThe facility receives compressed liquid chlorine in 1-ton (2,000 lb) cylinders.  Like anhydrous ammonia, chlorine quickly turns to a gas under atmospheric conditions.  The facility does not store more than a total of 8,000 pounds of chlorine at any given time. \n\nThe company also implements a Computer Maintenance Management System (SAP).  This computer system is used to track and schedule work orders for preventive, predictive and corrective maintenance as well as track parts inventory.
