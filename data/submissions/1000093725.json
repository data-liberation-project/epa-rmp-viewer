              "Description": "The prevention program for the various units or the single RMP process at CF Industries Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is the OSHA PSM Program implemented at the site. Ammonia is located in all manufacturing unit areas.  Natural gas (containing methane and ethane) is used as feedstock for the ammonia process and as a fuel throughout the facility.  Hydrogen is primarily present in ammonia manufacturing units, but trace amounts are a concern in urea manufacturing units also.  Dikes are generally employed to address potential spills from various chemical tanks throughout the process, but only the ammonia storage tank dikes address potential spills of a substance regulated by RMP.",
