Our safety strategy revolves around our \"Do It Right\" value and permeates our business in three key ways:\n\n?    Robust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\n\n?    Superior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\n\n?    Engaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\n\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\n\n\n\nDonaldsonville Nitrogen Complex and the regulated substances handled\n\nDonaldsonville Nitrogen Complex manufactures ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and diesel exhaust fluid. Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include non-isolated ammonium nitrate. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia and flammable gas mixtures - synthesis gas and natural gas.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68 and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality LAC 33:III.Chapter 59. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:\n\n?    Process safety information that is accurate and up to date;\n\n?    Well-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\n\n?    Written opera"
