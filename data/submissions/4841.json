      "SummaryText": "The Sugar Land South Wastewater Treatment Plant is currently a 5.0 MDG plant which is undergoing an expansion to 7.5 MGD.  The expansion should be completed in August of 1999.  This facility is committed to accident prevention and protection of employees and the public.  The plant is an activated sludge treatment plant utilizing chlorine gas as the disinfectant and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  The Sugar Land South Plant was constructed in 1986 and has never had an accidental release of a toxic chemical.\n\nThe worst case and alternate scenarios utililized the EPA Risk Management  Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants to model the distance to the toxic end point.  The worst case scenario for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is an  urban setting, 1.3 miles to the toxic end point and affecting 5,860 people.  The alternate scenario for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 0.2 miles to the toxic end point affecting 128 people.\n\nThe process safety hazard analysis was conducted using the what-if methodology.  Sixteen possible release scenarios were analysed using this method.  The consquences of the scenario and ways to prevent or minimize the release of toxic gases are presented.  The safety management plan also contains operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  These procedures deal with handling and storage, controlling leaks, loading and unloading, procedures for changing cylinders, use of SCBA's, first aid and health considerations.  These procedures also include the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for the operator to handle leak detection, alarms and leak notification.\n\nTo maintain compliance with the Process Safety Management Standard, the plant operator will certify that training has been provided to personnel operating the chlorine system and the sulfur dioxide system.  Also, refresher training will be conducted yearly.  This training will cover the areas of process safety information, operating procedures and emergency pro"

      "SummaryText": "cedures.  Training records will be maintained.   \n\nOutside contractors will be given a Contract Information Packet prior to starting work.  This packet will inform the contractors of the use of toxic compounds on site and the potential for hazardous release.  This packet will also inform the contractors of their responsibility while on site.\n\nThe mechanical integrity section itemizes the preventive maintenance on chlorine and sulfur dioxide related equipment.  This section also covers training of maintenance personnel.  Inspection and testing procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment is presented here along with the maintenance training documentation.\n\nThe emergency response plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR 68 pertaining to notification, medical treatment, response procedures, planning, use and maintenance of emergency equipment, employee safety training and emergency response evaluation dealing with chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.  After discovery of a leak, the chief operator and one other person will make an assessment of the situation.  If the assessment indicates that repair is possible, the facility repair team will be activated.  If the assessment indictes that a major leak has occurred, the local emergency response agency will be notified with a recommendation from the plant operator.  The emergency response plan has been reviewed by the City of Sugar Land and the plant operating company."
