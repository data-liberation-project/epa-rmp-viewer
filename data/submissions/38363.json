The first scenario is defined by EPA,  and assumes the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release caused by a transfer hose failure.  Anticipated results of both scenarios are included in our Risk Management Program and have also been supplied to our Local Emergency Planning Committee thru the Sarpy County Emergency Manager.\n\nMann Agricultural Supply, Inc has several key elements in our accident preventation plan:\n\n1.
