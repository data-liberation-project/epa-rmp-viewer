EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe MAP LLC Minnesota Refining Division is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Minnesota Refining Division workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Minnesota Refining Division has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Minnesota Refining Division and that complies with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Minnesota Refining Division.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Minnesota Refining Division.\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMinnesota Refining Division is committed to the safety of Minnesota Refining Division workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Minnesota Refining Division implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The overall emergency response program for the Minnesota Refining Division is coordinated with the facility Emergency Response Team (ERT), WAKOTA CAER, a local response cooperative, and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required.

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager?s staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM/RMP Coordinator.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division PSM/RMP Coordinator.  The division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Fire Chief.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone?s job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n1.2  The MAP LLC Minnesota Refining Division Regulated Substances\n\nMinnesota Refining Division is a refinery and petroleum products facility located in St. Paul Park, Minnesota.  Crude petroleum is the feed material to make a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances that USEPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the USEPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.

Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used as a catalyst in our HF Alkylation unit to make high quality gasoline components.  \n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMinnesota Refining Division performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios as defined by the USEPA.  Minnesota Refining Division does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like Minnesota Refining Division.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the local emergency responders, such as the fire departments improve the community emergency response plan.  We have submitted release scenario analyses to USEPA and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency response activities.  Please recognize that none of these events have occurred at the facility.  Also, for some of these events, emergency mitigation systems should reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred.  In all cases, if such events occurred, we would actuate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect both our employees and people in the community.\n\nAs stated previously, we have included details regarding these scenarios in the additional information submitted to USEPA with this executive summary, and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency planning, and me"

Because processes at the Minnesota Refining Division that are regulated by the USEPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the USEPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary also addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Minnesota Refining Division, where necessary, to satisfy USEPA?s Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member on the process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Minnesota Refining Division accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Minnesota Refining Division and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues, such as meetings of the Health and Safety Committee.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Minnesota Refining Division has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Critical Process Variable Documents.  The Minnesota Refining Division oerates equipment within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards as"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The PHA Team has considered off-site effects of potential releases in all PHA?s completed after August 1996. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures, exce"

In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Minnesota Refining Division has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Minnesota Refining Division operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operating employees periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with access to (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) work permit processes (i.e. for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Minnesota Refining Division personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional means to verify that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating c"
