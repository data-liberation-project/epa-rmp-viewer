All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The Welch emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans detailed specifically to the Welch facility located in North East, Pennsylvania and to the emergency response services available in the community as detailed in the Welch Off-Site plan submitted and approved by the Erie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Welch facility, located at South Lake Street, North East, Pennsylvania is a manufacturing facility that receives grapes and packages juices, jams and jellies.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes bulk tanks, process piping, various safety and monitoring systems and various chillers.  This system is manned by an operator on one shift and on other shifts, trained maintenance mechanics.  Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any alarms and to maintain the system.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is as follows:\n? Safety training for employees who maintain and inspect the system.\n? Effective, detailed procedures for maintenance, operation and troubleshooting of the systems.\n? Preventative maintenance programs to maintain a good mechanical integrity of the system.\n? The Management of Change program identifies potential concerns before system changes are implemented.\n? Detailed inspection program to identify potential concerns before they become a problem."

Chemical specific prevention steps for anhydrous ammonia include Level A, Level B and Level C personal protection equipment to be used for emergency response and certain other activities; training of emergency responders and maintenance employees on the toxic and physical properties of ammonia; the chemical sensing system and other safety systems; and the training of daily monitoring employees to the OSHA First Responder (8-hour) level.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWelch's has a comprehensive emergency response plan, including an Offsite plan that has been approved by the Erie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Welch has emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level (OSHA HAZWOPER standard), as well as the Incident Commander level. These responders are trained to handle potential releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Specific on-site response plans for handling releases of anhydrous ammonia exist.  The emergency response team is well equipped with chemical sensing equipment, personal protective equipment, offensive and defensive strategy tools and equipment, radio communication, pre-determined response check lists for Incidental Command, first aid responders, EMT's and medical supplies.  All Welch emergency response teams (fire, chemical and other emergency situations) use the Incident Command System.  This system includes provisions for interaction and support of offsite professional emergency responders.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) meeting the criteria of OSHA's PSM standard 29 CFR 1910.119 was initially conducted for the anhydrous ammonia system.  Since the initial PHA, the PHA has been updated.\n\nThe HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) method was used to a"

In regards to the mechanical integrity portion of PSM, the standard ANSI K-61.l was used to evaluate the safety and integrity of the system.  The PHA was then reviewed with all operators and mechanics trained to handle ammonia at the facility to inform them of the process, the results and as a training tool.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous procedures were created and many engineering improvements have been made to improve the safety and reliability of the system.  The most significant of these is as follows:\n-Installation of NH3 detectors and alarms in process areas, and\n-Replacement of all NH3 operation pressure relief valves, and\n-Implementation of new or upgraded maintenance procedures"
