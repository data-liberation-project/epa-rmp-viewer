During the manufacturing process the use of cooling is required which is primarily driven by three (3) separate closed loop, anhydrous ammonia mechanical refrigeration systems. These three (3) separate closed loop systems are at different locations in throughout the facility and are we are currently undergoing a facility project that will move one of these systems (2 Ammonia Compressors) from our \"Boiler Room\" and congregate all three systems in close proximity to one another (within the same engine room) as well as various other new ammonia equipment and process piping to this one system. Note - that the two (2) other systems will not be changed or modified directly.\n\nDue to consolidating all three (3) systems it is reasonable to assume that a process upset or catastrophic release could potentially impact all three (3) separate ammonia refrigeration systems and the submittal of this RMP Report.\n\n"
