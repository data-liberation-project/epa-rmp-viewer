We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community. As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history. 3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975. Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 92 percent, and releases to water 84 percent.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees. If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the local Fire Department and other emergency responders arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response.\n\n3. The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis location is a distribution center and warehouse for finished goods, primarily in small containers intended for consumer use. Containers are not opened on-site as part of any process.  We have five substances at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program. 3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality shipping and handling processes, equipment and maintenance.\n\nThe following five regulated substances are used at Midwest Distribution Center (MDC)- 3M Company:\n-Isobutane, pentane, propane, butane, and methyl ether are flammable gases that are used as propellants in aerosol cans. \n\n4 The Mid"

      "SummaryText": "west Distribution Center (MDC)- 3M Company Program to Prevent Accidental Releases\nAt the Midwest Distribution Center (MDC)- 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program. Programs are in place to address accidental release prevention measures consistent with appropriate federal, state, and local requirements. Beyond government requirements, we have 3M internal standards for continuously improving safety at our facility.\n\nReflecting the low risk and the five year history showing no accidental releases at this facility, EPA criteria for Program 1 designation are met and specific prevention program elements are not addressed in this plan.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere is no accident history for this facility. This is a new facility that will begin operation on 8/1/2007. Althought there is no accident history, for the Midwest Distribution Center (MDC)- 3M Company, no level of accident will be acceptable. We will work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations. \n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\n3M's first line of defense against accidents is prevention. At the Midwest Distribution Center - 3M Company we also work to ensure that we are prepared for any accident that might happen. We maintain a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas. We conduct regular drills and work with the local Fire Department to ensure the proper execution of our plan. Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n#7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Midwest Distribution Center (MDC)- 3M Company has developed an annual Environmental, Health, and Safety Plan (EHS Plan) utilizing sources of d"

Action items are then developed, including target completion dates and assignments to individuals and teams. The resulting EHS Plan is approved by Distribution Center and Corporate management teams. Once approved, the annual plan is reviewed with the entire Distribution Center staff. Action item progress is reviewed by the management teams each quarter."
