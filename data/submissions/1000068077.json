Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nFXI, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\n\n\n\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in two (2) 18,516-gallon, (1) 12,473-gallon, (1) 7,768-gallon TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage areas. The four (4) TDI Storage tanks have a combined storage capacity of 57,273-gallons. The 57,273-gallons of TDI equates to 582,466 pounds of TDI.  In addition, there may be up to a maximum of five (5) railcars waiting to be offloaded.  The five railcars equate to a maximum of 945,810 lbs of TDI.  Therefore, the total maximum amount of TDI that could be onsite (storage tanks and railcars) is 1,470,030 pounds of TDI.  The maximum on-site is rounded up to 1,471,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient"

Based on the Off Site Consequence Analysis, facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nFXI, Inc.'s specific prevention steps include:\n\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nD. Hazard Assessment:\n\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc.to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in wh"

      "SummaryText": "ich the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\nA release from a 20,000 gallon railcar has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  The catastrophic release would release approximately 203,400 lbs. of TDI onto the ground. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are no residential population within this distance to the endpoint but the impact distance touches the edge of a parking area at the 911 Center                \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  FXI, Inc. has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is the leak from an on-site 18,516 gallon TDI storage tank. The leak would release approximately 188,308 lbs. of TDI into a secondary containment area. The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.01 miles for the alternative release scenario. The impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property line.           \n\n          \n\nE. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\n1.

A system was established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operation, maintenance and other employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nOperating Procedures: FXI, Inc. has developed written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where TDI is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice.
