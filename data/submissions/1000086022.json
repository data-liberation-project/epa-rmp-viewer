These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nLineage-Woodland believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Our belief in environmental stewardship is revealed in our policies and demonstrated through our actions. Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Although such releases may not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response personnel at Clark County Fire & Rescue to control and mitigate the effects of any release should they occur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\r\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is used as a\r\nrefrigerant to support our process. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA, PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA, Section 302 notification requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\r\nstationary source:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLineage- Woodland maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes."
