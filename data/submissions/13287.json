The Facility Policy\n\n     The owner, management and employees of Hoxie Grain, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 50,000 pounds in our one 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 50,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia:.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History (either a. or b.).\n\n     a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n          -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n          - to our knowledge, have res"

The emergency response program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information \n          as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
