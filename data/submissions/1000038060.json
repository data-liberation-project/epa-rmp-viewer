Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nTaylor Farms Retail, Inc. conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Taylor Farms Retail facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for storage cooling, vacuum cooling and chilled water generation. Figures III.1 and III.2 show the facility location map and site plan, respectively. The facility was built in 2004 and operated by a different company. Taylor Fresh Foods purchased the facility in 2008 and replaced/modified some pressure vessels and added process chillers. River Ranch Fresh Foods leased and operated the facility from November 2012 to summer of 2014. Taylor Farms Retail, Inc. has since become the new operator and initiated facility start-up for the winter seaso"

      "SummaryText": "n of 2014.\r\nThe refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. The fixed system includes cold room evaporative cooling coils, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, a plate frame heat exchanger, and diffusion tank. Portable systems are two high side skids, one high side trailer and water chillers that are connected to the fixed system, and two separate high side trailer vacuum tube pairs. All of the refrigeration equipment except the cold room coils are located outdoors. Refrigeration Trailers R10, R26, and R67 are leased from Western Precooling Systems (WPS). The remaining systems are owned by Taylor Farms Retail, Inc.. The system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 27,500 lb.\r\nThe facility operates on a seasonal basis approximately from November 15 through April 15. During the offseason period, all the refrigeration trailers and the vacuum tubes are removed from the site, and the ammonia is stored in the fixed-system vessels and nurse tanks.\r\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single stage vapor compressor cycle. In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in Section V.A.2.\r\nA list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in the schedules located in Appendix B. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix A, describe equipment details. Figure III.3 shows the refrigeration system layout.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or"

See Appendix C for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTaylor Farms Retail, Inc. maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see the Incident Investigation procedures in Appendix N.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. System compressors have safety cut out switches that shuts down the compressors if system pressure reaches unsafe levels. Pressure vessels have float switches that controls the liquid levels in the vessels, and in low pressure receiver case, shuts down the ammonia pumps to prevent cavitation if the liquid level drops below certain level. All cold rooms are monitored by an alarm and detection system for unsafe ammonia concentration levels. Monitoring is done 24-hours per day. All relief valves except the surge drums and oil pots of the water chiller skids and the refrigeration trailer-vacuum tube pairs are tied into a diffusion tank to prevent a release to atmosphere in a high pressure situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to Taylor Farms Retail and previous operator, River Ranch Fresh Foods, personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coor"

The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix R.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are listed in Appendix T as Correction Items. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
