Two of those processes, the chlorination process and the dechlorination process, utilize chemicals regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program Rule: chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The chlorinination process adds chlorine gas to wastewater to reduce bacteria. The dechlorination process adds sulfur dioxide to remove excess chlorine prior to discharge to the St. Joseph River, protecting aquatic life in the river. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes each have their own storage and process areas. These processes have been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes. Each process has a gas detection / warning system, providing an alarm should concentration of chlorine or sulfur dioxide exceed 1 part per million. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Indiana as Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility maintains a compliance program to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps prevent the release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from these processes. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the event that they do occur, and to outli"
