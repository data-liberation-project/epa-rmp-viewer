      "SummaryText": "Hydrol Chemical Co. takes very seriosly its committment to maintaining the safetyof the residents of Yeadon Borough.  Our business supplies both the funereal industry and the diagnostic medical industry with the chemicals necessary for them to perform their functions within our immediate community, as well as communities nation-wide.  The products we produce are primarily made from formaldehyde solution,  which is an EPA regulated hazardous substance.\n     Working with any EPA regulated substances entails that a company regard its responsibility toward the safety of its workers, as well as the community it resides in, very seriously.  Therefore, Hydrol has developed and implemented multiple types of spill prevention process controls, and an emergency response plan, to limit the possibility of an accident affecting the Yeadon community.  We pride ourselves on the fact that there have been no accidental spills of formaldehyde at Hydrol within the last five years, and even longer.  This tells us that the controls we have in place are well planned and reliable.  For example, our storage tanks are diked.  This limits the amount of formaldehyde that would be able to evaporate into the air if an accidental spill would occur by containing it within a small area.  Our tanks are also located within a separate room in the building, allowing us to seal this area off if a spill occurred.  These measures insure that an accidental spill would have no effect on the residents of Yeadon.\n     Hydrol knows this by performing calculations from EPA generated guidelines for accidental spills of hazardous substances.  In an EPA defined \"worst case scenario\" for an accidental spill, Hydrol could theoretically spill 2,000 gallons of formaldehyde from its largest storage tank.  Since Hydrol has in place a containment dike around this vessel, and it is enclosed in a sealable room, a spill of this nature would have little or no effect on the community, and any effect felt would anly be wi"

      "SummaryText": "thin a distance of 200 feet from the Hydrol property line.\n     Even though a worst case scenario shows that a spill would have only a nominal effect, Hydrol has in place other measures to decrease the likelihood of a spill.  Our storage tanks are frequently inspected for suspect or worn controls like valves and pipes, and are appropriately maintained to be in optimum performance condition.  Extensive records are kept to insure thaat preventative maintenance is timely.  Our employees are also well trained on spill prevention procedures and response.\n     Our record and our committment to safety, though, is not enough.  Being complacent about accidental spills, even with the record we have, is not the Hydrol way.  We constantly strive to improve our controls and procedures.  We are currently upgrading our storage system to include redundant valving, and increased dike heights to limit vapor release in the event of a spill.  Every company must be ready for an accidental spill, no matter how unlikely.  Therefore, Hydrol does have an emergency response plan in place if such an event should occur.  Specifically, both the Yeadon Fire Co. and the Chester County Emergency Response Team would be notified immediately if a spill occurred.  Both of these responding teams have in their possession the appropriate information supplied by Hydrol, to insure that the responders as well as the community can be well protected.  Hydrol also contracts an excellent emergency response company, H.M.H.T.T.C. of Parsippany, NJ, to respond to an accidental spill with their expert staff.  Hydrol Chemical Co. believes that it has done its very best to prevent an accidental release of formaldehyde from occurring."
