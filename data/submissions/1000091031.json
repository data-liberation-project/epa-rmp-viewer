The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\r\n\r\n- Adding Mixed Pentane Blend Intermodal Transfers from Rail Cars into ISO Tank Containers at an existing RMP Covered Process, which previously applied only to Isopentane Intermodal Transfers.  n-Pentane represents a new regulated flammable substance present in the Mixed Pentane Blend to be handled at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \r\n\r\n- Removing Vinyl Acetate Monomer (\"VAM\") storage in Stolthaven Houston Tank P40-1 from the RMP. VAM is no longer stored and transferred from this tank.  \r\n\r\n- Removing Mixed Pentanes Direct Transfers performed between Rail Cars and Marine Vessels from the RMP. This operation is no longer conducted at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal. \r\n\r\n- Updating the Offsite Consequence Analysis worst-case release scenario and the alternate-case release scenarios for regulated toxic and flammable substances handled at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal based on a refined modeling and process analysis completed in November of 2020. Previous Offsite Consequence Analyses were conducted using the less detailed RMP*Comp platform. \r\n\r\n- Updating the facility's Emergency Contact name and information. \r\n\r\n- Updating the maximum on-site inventories for all 4 RMP regulated chemicals, and  \r\n\r\n- Various RMP data element updates based on revisions to Stolthaven Houston's Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOP\") found in the terminal's Local Training Manual (\"LTM\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a7 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nStolthaven Houston, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining our processes r"

Tank P50-4 has a working capacity of approximately 48,651-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of approximately 15.9-million pounds (2,043,337-gallons).  As a result of the 2017 VAM storage project for Tank P50-4, piping modifications were completed in P-Manifold to connect the marine transfer system for Tank P50-4 into the existing Dock Line 78 already in place for Tank P50-5 and dedicated to VAM service.  A new VAM filter-pot was also installed adjacent to Storage Tank P50-4.  \r\n\r\nNote that the Tank P50-4 VAM storage project did not change the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's worst-case release scenario for VAM, as the maximum quantity of this material held in any one tank did not increase; existing IFR Storage Tank P50-5 continues to have the largest inventory of VAM in storage.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water if-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks in close proximity.
