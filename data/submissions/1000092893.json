Our RMP program includes\r\nelements addressing:\r\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\r\npoints in our program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\r\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\r\nthat our employees are fully informed.\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\r\nrefrigeration system to identify the\r\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\r\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\r\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\r\nrefrigeration equipment.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\r\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\r\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\r\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\r\nof the refrigeration system.\r\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are\r\nscreened to verify that they are within the original safe design\r\nlimits.\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we\r\nconduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new\r\nequipment has been designed a"
