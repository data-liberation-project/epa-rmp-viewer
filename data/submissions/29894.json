Training is verified by a combination of documented experience, observational methods and verbal testing.  Training is documented in writing, and reinforced by refresher training at least every three years.\n\nContractors.   The facility uses various contractors for major plant modifications as well as for certain scheduled preventative and unscheduled maintenance.  Contractors are provided a site safety briefing at the start of any new work, and contractors performing continuing services are required to provide documentation of training to facility personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits.  Compliance audits of the general facility including reporting and recordkeeping, operator, maintenance, and contractor compliance will be scheduled as the facility comes on-line.  To-date, no audits have been performed other than those associated with construction quality assurance.\n\nIncident Investigation.  Incidents (involving a catastrophic release) will be documented and investigated.  The investigation will begin within 48 hours of the release, and a written analysis of the cause and recommendations for future prevention will be prepared, discussed with affected personnel, and retained for a minimum of 5 years.  To-date, there have been no catastrophic incidents.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility is newly constructed and to-date there have been no accidents involving regulated substances that have resulted in any onsite injuries or significant property damage or any offsite response.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nA general Emergency Response (ER) Plan has been prepared for several EnCana facilities, including the Mamm Creek Conditioning Facility.

Operators of the facility have an on-going commitment to safety and accident prevention.  This commitment is demonstrated by upper management\u00bfs support of an active EH&S program. An employee training program is implemented as part of this comprehensive EH&S management system, as well as the use of established design and construction standards (API, ASME, NEC), and the installation of a state-of-the art process control and monitoring systems.  The facility was constructed by skilled tradesmen who, in many cases, were required to demonstrate their skills and pass certification requirements prior to working on the project.  On-going construction inspection and quality assurance procedures included X-ray examination of welds for additional quality control.  Shop-fabricated equipment skids were used where possible to minimize field construction.\n\nCritical process parameters are monitored remotely on a 24-hour basis using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technologies.  This approach enables facility operation using no full-time onsite personnel.  The SCADA systems permit both automated as well as operator-directed responses to process conditions as well as provide immediate annunciation and identification of numerous potential and actual alarm conditions.  Plant personnel are trained to respond to remote alarm conditions with both remote and on-scene responses.  Various automatic process safeguards and interlocks are intended to preclude a release.  If a release should occur, these systems allow an immediate remote response from trained operators as well as alerting"

Included with the regulated flammables are additional non-regulated flammables in the C-6 through C-8 range.  These materials are all stored in pressure vessels at ambient temperatures and at approximately 60 psig to control vapor release.  There are no regulated toxic materials.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Mamm Creek Conditioning Facility is located in a remote area with no identified residential occupancies within more than one-half mile of the locations of regulated flammable storage.  There are no full-time employees assigned to the facility, and following construction, the estimated presence of onsite personnel is 3-4 hours per day.  As such, this facility is considered to be a normally unoccupied remote facility (NURF) and is not covered by the OSHA process safety management (PSM) standard.\n\nEmployee Participation.  All employees are trained on accident prevention and emergency response as part of their formal training.  An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared that identifies specific employee responsibilities and responses, and lists the reporting requirements, names, and telephone numbers for key company personnel.  Employees are expected to participate in the Company\u00bfs Hazard Identification Program.    \n\nDesign Codes and Standards.  The facility is newly designed and constructed.  The design standards follow the most recent code requirements including, where appropriate, ASTM, ASME, API, and NEC. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis.

      "SummaryText": "identify major hazards that might be encountered.  This hazard identification includes the following potential items: fire, explosion, overpressurization, corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, and loss of plant utilities.  Following the initial hazard review, periodic updates at least every 5 years and after any major process change, unplanned event, or release will be conducted.\n\nVarious process controls are in place to regulate the process and prevent any unplanned events.  The process equipment includes various vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, equipment interlocks, level monitors, and flow meters to maintain normal control.  Normal excess vapor is collected and routed to a flare.  Unexpected excess vapor can be relieved through safety relief valves.  Alarm systems continuously monitor the process.  The monitoring information can be accessed on-site, and is also transmitted to the offsite central Gas Control Center where it is monitored by operating personnel 24-hours per day. \n\nThere are no dikes or containment structures for the pressurized flammable substance storage tanks.  This provision is intentional and designed to allow volatile liquid spills to dissipate and spread over the greatest possible area and evaporate.  Use of dikes around the pressure tanks would contain a liquid pool, and a resulting pool fire could overheat the pressure tanks causing a greater hazard than the original evaporating spill.  With respect to the pressurized storage tanks, there are no direct mitigation systems in general use.  There are also no area release monitoring or detection systems other than the unit and tank process alarms from equipment failure, high level, high temperature, or high pressure. \n\nOperator Training. Operators have written instructions for normal operations and emergency responses.  These instructions include normal and emergency startup and shutdown, as well as a variety of special procedures for restarting and a"
