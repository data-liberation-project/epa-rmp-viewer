They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut off switches for shutting down the system. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point. Monitoring is 24 hours a day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. Relief valves at the 1140 Meeks St. facility are tied to an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an offsite release. \n\nNo emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel and for releases above an ammonia concentration of 300 ppm.\n\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency Action training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2.

A Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals Safety Data Sheet (GHS-SDS) (previously MSDS sheets) for\nAmmonia is included in Appendix C. Written in English, the GHS-SDS details the chemical properties, health hazards and exposure limits of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAcutely Hazardous Material Uses\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooling systems. The cooling system consists of a single-stage ammonia refrigeration system with a central plant and a piping loop distributing refrigerant throughout the site.\n\nThe system contains approximately 140,000 lb. of ammonia. This is an engineering estimate based on calculations of the system volume. The exact ammonia volume is not known due to the system's age and the fact that the ammonia was not measured into the system. The TPQ for ammonia is 500 lbs.\n\nThe main engine room is located at 1040 Growers Street. The main condensers and receivers and the main liquid shutoff valve (King Valve) are located at 1140 Meeks Street. The emergency ammonia high pressure diffusion system consists of a high to low pressure manual relief valve system; a low pressure to high pressure relief valve system, and a water diffuser system located at 1140 Meeks Street. Each system is only to be used in an absolute catastrophic emergency to relieve excess pressure.\n\nThere are windsocks located around the main property as an aid for evacuation. A facility-wide computer system manufactured by Andover Corporation controls the temperature of the cold rooms, and operation of evaporators, compressors, and condensers. Safeties are monitored on a real time basis and the computer will test the appropriate responder in the event of an ammonia leak, and related safety hazards.

On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response (Growers Ice Company personnel are trained in response). First response may include emergency shut down of equipment, system isolation, controlled operations, such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release.\n\nLocal fire and police departments will provide emergency response for a major release event with mutual aid from Growers Ice Company response employees.\nEmergency Response notification phone numbers are found in detail in the RMP, reporting Procedures. Detailed phone numbers are updated yearly. Phone Numbers are located in all the\nRMP binders and on the face of the Business Response Plan (which contains GIC Emergency response information), Evacuation maps are provided, and windsocks are strategically located on the property to aid in determining prevailing wind and escape routes.\n\nAmmonia detection systems consist of detectors located throughout the property. These detectors are monitored by a computerized monitoring system. An automatic dialing system notifies Growers Ice Company personnel and supervisors depending on the severity of the leak.\nA complete location of leak detectors is found in the RMP with appropriate maps and location detail. Ammonia Detector and maps are located in Section II.A - Executive Summary in the map Section.\n\n9. Emergency Response Program\nThe Growers Ice Company facility has implemented the state and county mandated \"Emergency\nResponse Plan\" (a.k.a. \"Business Response Plan\"). This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response. Local community and business notification phone numbers are also found in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n10.
