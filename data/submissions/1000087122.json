Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nAt our power plants, we handle isobutane, isopentane and pentane which are considered hazardous flammables by the US EPA. The same properties that make these regulated substances valuable as a working fluid for the power plants also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure,  to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our facility staff personnel, and to reduce the threat to our community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these regulated substances combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of these facilities and with the safe operating procedures, mechanical integrity program and the training of our personnel. \n\n\n\nSince our operators do not respond to large chemical releases, we have implemented an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for handling small releases of hazardous chemicals as required by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe purpose of our operation is to generate electricity by utilizing the geothermal resource as a source of energy.  The property in which the Steamboat power plants are located is approximately nine miles south of Reno, Nevada and includes seven power plants designated as SB2, SB3, Galena 1, Galena 2, Galena 3, SBHR and Steamboat Hills. The SB2 and SB3 power plants (SB2/3) are located in the northeast corner of the property and both use the regulated substance isobutane as the working fluid. Galena 1 is located 0.2 miles south of where the SB1/SB1A system was previously located.  Galena 3 is located a half mile southwest of SB2/3. Galena 1 and Galena 3 are virtually identical to each other, they both utilize Pentane as their motive fluid.  Galena 2 and Steamboat Hills are located 1.5 miles south"

SBHR (OEC-51 and 52) are located 1 mile southwest of Galena 3, and utilizes isopentane as its working fluid. \n\n\n\n- Geothermal Energy and Power Plants\n\nGeothermal energy is renewable heat energy from the earth's core. Geothermal reservoirs of hot water and steam are tapped with production wells and the heat from the geothermal resource is converted to electricity. \n\nAt the Steamboat Power Plants:  SB2/3, SBHR, Galena 1 and Galena 3, hot geothermal brine at temperatures of 300?-315? F is pumped from production wells drilled into the geothermal reservoir. The brine is kept under pressure to keep it from flashing to steam as it is piped through the plant to the heat exchangers where the heat is transferred from the brine to a working fluid (isobutane or pentane). The spent geothermal brine is then injected back into the geothermal reservoir keeping the cycle closed. The heat that was transferred to the working fluid causes the fluid to turn into a vapor.  The vapor is piped through the blades of a turbine, spinning the turbine which is connected to a generator and produces electricity. The hot vapor is then piped through air-cooled condenser tubes, transforming it back to a fluid. The fluid is cycled back to the heat exchangers in a closed-loop system and the process starts again.\n\nGalena 2 runs much the same as the lower steamboat plants, but rather than keeping the brine under intense pressure to keep it a liquid, the geothermal fluid coming out of the ground is separated into steam and brine lines.  Galena has a preheater that is heated by hot brine, and a vaporizer that is heated by steam.  After the steam runs through the vaporizer, it condenses into water and then runs through a recuperator where it heats the water going into the preheater.  The spent steam then mixed into the brine, and then pumped back into the ground at one of our injection wells.\n\nThe Steamboat Hills facility or SBH has two tur"

Rather than using steam in the vaporizer and brine in the preheater, the Steamboat hills plant sends all the brine through OEC 41, and the steam through the STG.  The steam coming out of the STG is condensed buy use of a cooling tower. Any water that isn't lost to the atmosphere during condensation is used to condense the working fluid in a water cooled condenser then mixed with the spent brine on OEC 41 and sent back to injection. \n\n\n\n-  SB1 & SB1A Overview\n\nBoth facilities have been fully decommissioned and demolished.\n\n\n\n-  SB2 & SB3 Overview\n\nThe SB2/3 power plants were developed by Steamboat Development Corporation in 1992. In February 2004 Ormat Nevada, Inc assumed the operation of these two plants, while retaining the entire operations, maintenance and management staff.

SBHR uses 578,181 pounds of isopentane as the working fluid in a closed loop system.\n\n\n\n-Steamboat Hills Overview\n\nThe Steamboat Hills facility was developed in 1987 by Caithness Power L.L.C. originally the plan consisted of a single steam powered turbine.  The facility was purchased by Steamboat Hills, LLC in 2004 and in 2006 an Ormat bottoming unit was installed that utilizes the hot brine that is unable to run through the steam turbine.  Together the STG and OEC 41 can put out approximately 15 MW of power. Steamboat Hills uses 50,706 pounds of pentane as the working fluid in a closed loop\n\n\n\n3.  General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses primarily upon the proper training and actions of our operators as outlined by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP), and NDEP's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP). The Training Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Incident Investigation Program, and Management of Change Program ensure that the operator is aware of all potential hazards as well as the measures to mitigate them. \n\n\n\nThe Preventive Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity Program are essential in maintaining the integrity of the equipment. Monthly emission inspections are performed to detect leaks at all valve packing and piping flanges, and the proper operation of equipment also play a critical role in our prevention program.\n\nIn addition the Accidental Release Prevention Program relies upon safeguards inherent to the design of the power plant. Such safeguards include gas sensors and alarms, relief valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, vents, and check valves. \n\nIn the event of a fire, the plants are equipped with a sprinkler system, deluge system, fire monitors and hydrants. The operating staff are also trained in the Emergency Action Plan and evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\n4.  Five Year Incident History:\n\nWe have ha"

Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur plants have been operating safely for many years, we will continue to ensure extensive training is provided to are operators as they are essential to plant safety.  A process Hazard analysis is performed on each plant a minimum of every five years or as needed due to a process change. In addition, we will evaluate any new mitigation or control technology that may improve safety at the Steamboat Complex.\n\n"
