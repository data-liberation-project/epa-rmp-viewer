      "SummaryText": "FACILITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe John Flannagan Water Authority is located on Virginia Route 614 in Dickenson County Virginia.  Its facilities are involved in the treatment of water for distribution to Buchanan and Dickenson Counties.  It has been in operation since 1980 without any hazardous materials incidents.  The only chemical that the Authority uses that comes under this regulation is Chlorine.  We have anywhere from 2-4 ton cylinders on hand at any particular time during the calender year.  The Chlorine is stored in its own room with an outside entrance.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nThe Authority has the chlorine stored in a locked separate room with its own ventilation system.  There is a constant monitor for chlorine feed rates and also for leak detection.  Each is attached to an audible alarm system that sounds in the event of an alarm.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Authority's plan states that all releases will be reported.  Agencies include the Virginia Department of Health, Virginia Department of Enviromental Quality, Local Emergency Service Office, and Local Fire and Rescue Agencies.  The Authority owns and maintains a Chlorine repair kit for ton cylinders and had SCBA for entry to hazardous atomspheres.  The Authority's policy in the event of a major leak is to contact the local emergency response agencies by telephone, these include law enforcement, fire, rescue and hazardous materials response team.  There are only 4 residences within the worse case release scenerio and the plan calls for their evacuation in the event of a major leak.  There is also a recreation area at the very outer limits of the release zone.  There could be anywhere from 0-50 people at this site at any given time, but normal occupancy would be in the range of 0-10.  These people would be evacuated but face to face communications.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe Authority used the program RMP Comp to determine our worst case and alternative"

      "SummaryText": " scenarios.  With the worst case scenario, the Authority would lose the entire contents of one (1) ton cylinder.  This release would travel a distance of approximately 0.9 miles (1.4 km).  Within this area are only 4 residences and a picnic area.  As Chlorine is heavier than air and our area is mountainous, the most likely movement of any release would be downhill toward the Flannagan Reservior.  With the alternative release scenario, the Authority would lose approximately 1500 pounds.  The release would travel a distance of approximately 0.1 miles (0.2 km).  This release would stay within the confines of the Authority's property and affect no outside population.\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Authority trains all personnel in safe Chlorine handling and maintenance of the Chlorine feed and handling systems.  All cylinders are stored indoors in a locked room.  Cylinders are stored on individual stands to prevent accidental movement.  Cylinders are moved from one place to another by means of a hoist system.  The Authority has constant monitor systems for feed rates and accidental release that are attached to an audible alarm system. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Authority has not had any reportable quantity releases of chlorine since operations started in 1980.  All personnel have been trained in the safe handling and use of chlorine.  This includes proper handling and placement of cylinders, proper methods of attaching and detaching the chemical feed lines, use of SCBA and the use of the various repair items included in the ton cylinder repair kit.  Training is obtained by means of on-the-job training as well as seminars through the AWWA and Virginia Rural Water Association.  Five of the nine total personnel are Virginia certified as either Class 1and Class 2  Water Works Operators.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Authority developed an emergency response program to meet the requirements of the SARA Title III requirements.  This involves coordinated resp"
