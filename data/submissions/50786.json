      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNuGen Energy, LLC\n\nNuGen Energy, LLC is a facility which has only been in operation for 4 years.  Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that NuGen Energy, LLC is a relatively new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management, despite several ownership changes. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nNuGen Energy, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nNuGen Energy, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nNuGen Energy, LLC's ethanol plant is located in Marion, Turner County, South Dakota.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  NuGen Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on-site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud, or releasing 380,800 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on-site.  The worst case t"

Residence homes, schools and other public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on-site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\n\nAlthough NuGen Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nNuGen Energy, LLC was constructed as a new ethanol facility and started operations in 2008, and was subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on-site.  There have been 4 state-reported accidents since the establishment of NuGen Energy, LLC.\n1. 2/28-2008 - Sodium Hydroxide onto soil - NON-RMP\n2. 4/13/2008 - Sodium Hydroxide onto plant soil - NON-RMP\n3. 5/17/2008 - Denatured Ethanol out of load-out containment into soil - RMP - Denaturant\n4. 9/10/2008 - Denatured Ethanol out of load-out containment into soil - RMP - Denaturant\n5. 12/13/2010 - Distiller's Syrup out of truck to plant soil. - NON-RMP\n6. 1/13/11 - Diesel Fuel out of fuel tank onto plant soil. - NON-RMP\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nNuGen Energy, LLC's ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan, ICP, SPCCC, as well as other similar programs.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  NuGen Energy, LLC 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safet"
