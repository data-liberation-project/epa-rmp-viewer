      "SummaryText": "I. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHercules Incorporated's Missouri Chemical Works (MCW) Plant is committed to being an asset to its community.  MCW has formed a community advisory panel (CAP) to encourage the exchange of ideas and information between MCW officials, business leaders and concerned citizens.  CAP meetings are held on a regular basis to keep the public informed of MCW activities and to gather and address any concerns raised by the community.   \n\nManagement makes every effort to ensure both employee safety and community safety through the plant management structure.  The plant manager has overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an effective preventive program as required by the Program 3 Prevention Program.   Most of the responsibility for this program is shared between the Safety Department and the Technical Department. The Safety Department is responsible for process safety, including the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The Safety Manager is responsible for the Emergency Control Plan and serves as the plant emergency contact and alternate member of the LEPC.  The Safety Engineer is responsible for the overall operation of the PSM program.  The Technical Manager serves on the LEPC and the Environmental Engineer is responsible for the operation of the environmental program including the off site consequences analysis and the environmental Best Management Practices for prevention of releases.\n\nGeneral responsibilities for the Prevention Program 3 follow:\n\nProcess Safety Information (Part 68.65) - Safety Dept., Safety Engineer\nProcess Hazard Analysis (Part 68.67) - Safety Dept., Safety Engineer\nOperating Procedures (Part 68.69) - Area Leaders with review by plant management staff\nTraining (Part 68.71) - Safety Dept., Safety Engineer; Area Leaders\nMechanical Integrity (68.73) - Safety Dept., Safety Engineer\nManagement of Change (68.75) - Corporate Program, Safety Department w/Technical Dept as"

Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Hercules MCW Plant is a chemical manufacturing plant located in Louisiana, Missouri that manufactures formaldehyde, pentaerythritol (PE), nitroform, synthetic lubricant and provides its own utilities.  Besides formaldehyde, the plant handles two other substances regulated by the risk management plan provisions (RMP) of 40 CFR 68: acetaldehyde and chlorine. \n\nAcetaldehyde, a flammable, is used as a reactant in the PE process.  Acetaldehyde is pumped from a railcar or tanker truck into one of six storage tanks.  From the tanks, acetaldehyde is pumped to the weigh tank, which is used to ensure a set amount of acetaldehyde is charged to the PE reactor. The maximum amount of acetaldehyde in the RMP covered process is approximately 160,000 gallons with the largest vessel in the process being a 30,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nChlorine is used in water treatment activities at the plant including process water, soft water and cooling tower water disinfection.  It is received in either 150-pound cylinders or 1 ton cylinders and is stored at various locations throughout the plant.  The areas storing the 150 pound cylinders are not considered RMP regulated processes because each area stores at a maximum 10 cylinders or 1500 pounds of chlorine.  The areas are also isolated from one another so that an accident in one area will not trigger a release in another area.\n\nHowever, the one ton cylinders stored and used at the water filtration plant do trigger RMP requirements as the maximum amount of chlorine in the"

      "SummaryText": "response procedures for all personnel and more specific requirements for MCW response personnel are depicted in the plans. \n\nEmployees are trained on notification procedures as well as on other actions to take in response to an incident.  The emergency response plans are reviewed annually with employees as part of the monthly safety meetings held by the Safety Department.  In addition, hazards associated with processes are discussed in the Right-to-Know training provided to all MCW employees.  Contractors receive a Safety Orientation course prior to being allowed to work on MCW property.   Training drills are required to be conducted at least annually and typically far more frequently to help keep employees aware of their rolls during an emergency incident.  MCW personnel participate in planned exercises held by the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Several drills have been hosted by the MCW plant and either simulated release of a chemical or were related to preventing release of a chemical. \n\nIn addition to emergency response procedures, the plans address procedures to help prevent accidents such as equipment and area inspection schedules and discussions at monthly safety meetings on ways to keep work areas clean and therefore accident free.\n\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSignificant security upgrades are to be initiated over the next 18 months to provide improved security for the employees and RMP chemicals."

      "SummaryText": "RMP covered process is about 12,000 pounds.  This chlorine is used to disinfect process water used for operations throughout the plant and soft water used as boiler feed by the powerhouse.  The plant keeps at most six 1 ton cylinders in the chlorine storage and supply building.  Of these six cylinders, one is actively being used and another is connected to the same chlorination station as backup.\n\nFormaldehyde is manufactured by burning methanol over a silver catalyst in three converters.  The exiting vapor stream is condensed, routed through an absorption column and distilled to remove the majority of unreacted methanol.  The formaldehyde solution is stored in one of seven tanks.  The largest tank has a capacity of 200,000 gallons and is typically used to supply raw material for PE production and Nitroform production.  Formaldehyde is stored at the plant in various concentrations.  The maximum amount of formaldehyde solution stored in the formaldehyde RMP covered process is typically less than 310,000 gallons.\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMCW has a policy of compliance and where economically possible to exceed the requirements of applicable federal, state and local regulations.  Accidental release and emergency response specific regulations are discussed below.\n\nMCW has three chemicals subject to the accidental release regulations of 40 CFR 68.  Based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these process chemicals and the fact that the modeled impact distances extend to off-site receptors, all three RMP regulated process chemicals at MCW are classified as Program Level 3.\n\nThese RMP regulated process chemicals are also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) provisions.  These provisions were developed to ensure the safety of workers by requiring, among other things, the development of and training on standard oper"

By complying with OSHA's PSM standards, MCW is complying with the Prevention Program elements of the RMP regulations.\n\nOSHA as well as the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) require the development of emergency response procedures in case of an accident.  MCW's Best Management Practices Plan (BMP) address actions to take to prevent a discharge of a hazardous substance and actions to take in case a discharge occurs.  The Emergency Control Plan provides procedures for employees to follow in response to various types of emergencies that may occur at the plant.  These emergency response plans were developed to meet the regulations listed above.  \n\n\nIV. Five-Year Accident History\n\nHercules Incorporated has had no accidental releases of acetaldehyde, chlorine or formaldehyde from covered processes that have resulted in offsite injury, death or environmental damage resulting in response or restoration activities to date.\n\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nAs discussed in Section III, MCW uses two emergency response plans to combat potential accidents: the BMP Plan and the Emergency Control Plan.  The plans address plant security, notification procedures, response procedures, employee training including drills, a list of available response equipment, preventative maintenance procedures and good housekeeping practices.\n\nAccess to MCW is controlled 24 hours a day through one main entrance gate.  The rest of the plant is surrounded by a barbed wire topped chain link fence. \n\nMCW coordinates emergency response efforts with the Pike County Local Emergency Planning Committee. Notification of the local emergency response agencies is outlined in the emergency response plans.  General"
