Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Crop Production Services, 3348 Claus Road, Modesto California are committed to the prevention of a release of Anhydrous Ammonia and pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agronomic services to growers and ranchers.  To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\n\n\na. Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.  No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\n\n\nB. Five  agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are regulated substances.  The maximum process quantities (in pounds of active ingredient) of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Azinphos-Methyl (540 pounds); Dimethoate (4860 pounds); Fenamiphos (350 pounds); Paraquat Dichloride (3432 pounds) and Parathion-Methyl (1134 pounds).\n\n\n\nC. Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in a 30,000-gallon capacity aboveground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at the facility is 131,325 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resultin"

      "SummaryText": "g in potential failures of the chemical handling system covered by the RMP.  Program 2 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario.  The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"The greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over ten minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nCPS Modesto has comprehensive written programs and procedures to comply with the CalARP RMP program regulations.  Key to getting all programs and procedures in place was (1) having the facility management understand what the CalARP RMP regulations required and (2) developing and implementing specific written programs, written procedures and practices to meet those regulations.\n\n\n\nFacility management and employees involved in any of the covered processes have been trained and made aware of the provisions and requirements in the programs and practices.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases of Anhydrous Ammonia or any of the five regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse that have caused any deaths, injuries or property damage at the facility nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage."
