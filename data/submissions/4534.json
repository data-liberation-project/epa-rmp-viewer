      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview:  The Northeast Distribution Center in Agawam, Massachusetts is a distribution center for laboratory equipment, apparatuses, and laboratory-grade chemicals.  The facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act Amendments due to onsite storage capacities of chloroform, hydrochloric acid, and ethyl ether.  At the time of the submittal, the facility had approximately 50,400 pounds of chloroform; 4,600 pounds of hydrochloric acid; and 8,700 pounds of ethyl ether in storage.  The amounts of hydrochloric acid and ethyl ether differ from the quantities reported in Section 1.17 of this document; the amounts in Section 1.17 are the threshold quantities of these substances.  The facility predictively filed for hydrochloric acid and ethyl ether in the event that the quantity of these materials stored on site exceeds the threshold quantities.  Chemical storage is the only regulated process at the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  The facility's overall approach and committment to proper chemical management is demonstrated by training, procedures, and maintenance systems currently in place at the facility.  The facility is committed to ensuring safe operations in accordance with Part 68 requirements and has established a senior manager responsible for Part 68 implementation and compliance.  \n\nRelease Scenarios:  Worst-case scenarios were conducted for chloroform, hydrochloric acid, and ethyl ether for each chemical's single largest vessel based on US EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance and EPA-approved modeling.  The worst-case release scenarios for chloroform and hydrochloric acid consisted of a liquid spill and vaporization.  The largest container size of chloroform was 200 liters; the largest container size of hydrochloric acid was 6.5 gallons.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chloroform was 0.01 miles, and the distance to the endpoint for hydrochloric acid was 0.03 miles.  The worst-cas"

      "SummaryText": "e release scenario for ethyl ether involved a vapor cloud explosion of a 20 liter container.  The distance to the endpoint was 0.02 miles.  None of the worst-case scenarios resulted in an impact to the public or environmental receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:  Employees are trained on the proper procedures for chemical handling and release notification.  Training is provided to new employees during orientation and to existing employees annually during hazard communication training.  Members of the facility's emergency response team also receive annual refresher training per the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nFive-year Accident History:  The facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of ethyl ether, hydrochloric acid, or chloroform within the five years preceding RMP submittal.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  Twelve facility employees are trained per the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 for first responders.  In the event that the facility's first responders are not able to contain a spill or release, the facility has coordinated response efforts with the Agawam Fire Department to ensure that the Department will respond as necessary.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure that the Agawam Fire Department will be properly notified when response is required for a release.  The facility has submitted copies of its SARA 302, 311, and 312 reports to the Agawam Fire Department.  The Northeast Distribution Center is subject to emergency response plan requirements including 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.  In addition, the facility is subject to the preparedness and prevention requirements of 40 CFR 265 Subpart C since the facility is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Periodic reviews of the program, training, and maintenance procedures are conducted to ensure that any necessary and appropriate changes are made to maintain an"
