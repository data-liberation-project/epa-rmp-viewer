The facility seeks to implement a butane blending process and plans to install a single 90,000-gallon pressurized horizontal bullet butane storage vessel.   The facility already has existing pipeline, truck transfer and storage areas. \r\n\r\nThe butane blending process at the terminal will consist of injecting butane into its gasoline immediately prior to truck loading of various gasoline products.  The terminal will receive butane via tanker trucks and will store the butane in the 90,000-gallon pressurized horizontal butane storage vessel.  The butane blending operation and associated butane storage render the terminal subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, this operation renders the terminal subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) -  Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR  \u00a71910.119.  The facility also stores additional flammable substances in pressurized vessels which are covered under the OSHA PSM standard.   Furthermore, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3 requirements. \r\n\r\nBoth Chevron and the terminal have a long-standing commitment to both worker and public safety, which is demonstrated by efforts set forth in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nChevro"

On a global scale, Chevron has implemented its Operational Excellence (OE) process that establishes the standards by which all Chevron business units must operate.  Guided by the Chevron OE process, the terminal has implemented a robust OSHA PSM program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment. Refer to Section 7 of this RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the\r\nterminal's OSHA PSM program.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe butane blending process is a new covered process at the facility and there have been no RMP related accidents at the facility that meet the five-year accident history criteria.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nThe terminal maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and\r\ndecontamination requirements. In addition, the terminal has developed procedures that address\r\nmaintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to terminal processes or operations.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which inclu"

The overall emergency response program for the terminal is coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the\r\ncommittee, which are attended by local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the terminal provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances at the terminal."
