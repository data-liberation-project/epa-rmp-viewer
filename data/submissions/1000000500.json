Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous materials unit so that the appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental release.\n\n                                                                                                                                                      There have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no planned changes to improve the safety of the process. If Airgas identifies technologies or procedures that might improve safety, they will evaluate the feasibility of such a change and implement if appropriate.\n\n                                                                                                     "
