The inherent properties of anhydrous ammonia make it necessary to observe strict safety precautions in its handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our personnel?s health and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community.  Its is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and Commonwealth regulations as they pertain to matters of environment, health and safety.  Safety is dependant on the proper handling of ammonia, well maintained and properly operating equipment and thorough training of our personnel.\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Compressed Gas Association, Inc. /The Fertilizer Institute?s ?American National Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,? training programs developed by large ammonia manufacturers and good engineering practice.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local FD and state and local emergency planning/response committees.\n\n2.THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThis facility imports, stores and handles anhydrous ammonia for the production of ammonium sulfoxides and ammonium hydroxide.  The anhydrous ammonia is shipped and received in IMO-V isotainers transported by ship and then hauled by truck to our facility where it is stored in four steel pressure gas tanks.  Both the IMO-V containers and the storage tanks are equipped with safety relief valves and excess flow valves.  It is transferred to the process via 1.5? schedule 80 steel pipe.  The facility has the proper safety equipment to ensure safe unloading of the containers and to affect any required maintenance and /or repairs.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees and authorized management personnel.  The regulated substance "

(INCLUDED THOUGH NOT REQUIRED)\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum amount allowed would release 146,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Company policy limits the filling capacity of this tank to 85% at 85 degrees F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 6.9 miles.\nAlternative Scenario: Failure of 20 foot length of 2 inch hose used to unload the IMO-V containers to the storage tanks.  Excess flow and check valves function to stop the flow.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the hose (30 pounds) are released as vapor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is less than 1000 feet.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule, OSHA?s PSM/PHA Regulations and all applicable environment, safety and health regulations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Good engineering practice includes redundant excess flow valves on the liquid phase and excess flow valves on the gas draw off points.  Third party inspection and certification of IMO-V containers and storage tanks is effected as required by regulations.\n\n5.FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility.\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based upon the ?American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?
