ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY\nPOLICIES\n\n     National Cold Storage recognizes management's responsibility in\nprotecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment.\nThe safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control\nof accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of\nall personnel in the facility.\n\n     The National Cold Storage PSM/RMP program assigns and documents\nthe specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and \nintegrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety\nprogram.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the\nway we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a\nproject we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing\ndate has passed.\n\n     National Cold Sorage believes that Employee participation is the\nkey to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly\nthe Mericle Mechanical Service Manager and the Refrigeration System Operators,\nhave been deeplly involved in implementing the PSM/RMP Program and they\nassume the major responsibility for operating the Los Angeles facility\nsafely.\n\n     The National Cold Storage Emergency Response Program is being\ndeveloped with the cooperation and support of the Los Angeles Fire\nDepartment.  All National cold storage employees have received\ndocumented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     National Cold Storage processes ducks  for the Los Angeles\nMarkets.\n      Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in\nquantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     Please refer to the Off-Site Consequence (OCA) data located onsite at National Cold Storage.\n\nIV.

Facility tours and\nrisk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written\nrequest.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia at National Cold Storage\nLos Angeles facility that resulted in an injury, or that had an\noff-site impact (evacuation or shelter-in-place), or that resulted in\nsignificant property damage either on-site or off-site.   An ammonia\nrelease considered by National Cold Storage to be very serious occurred\nin October of 1998 and was the immediate cause for upgrading and\nimproving the National Cold Storage Safety Program.\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental\nammonia release.  The site emergency response plan is being coordinated\nwith the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local\nFire Department.\n\nVII.
