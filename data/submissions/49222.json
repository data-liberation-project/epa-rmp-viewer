Further Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry further processing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for our refrigeration process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is approximately 35,000.00 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our Further Processing Plant.  In this scenario 35,000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as enclosure(s) and emergency manual power shut off are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of isolating and limiting the flow of ammonia through the system.  At Class F atmospheric stabilit"

The scenario involves the release of 3000 lb. of ammonia and is assumed to be released a relief valve.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 120 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the flow of ammonia through the system.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles or 176 yards.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from our Poultry Further Processing Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 200 lb. of ammonia and is assumed to be released from a transfer hose failure.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 2 minutes.
