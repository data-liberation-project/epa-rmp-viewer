Under 112(r), there are categories of facilities: Program 1, Program 2, and Program 3. These categories of facilities are based on the potential for offsite public exposure from a worst-case accidental release, accident history, and the facility compliance status under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards. The major components of this RMP include a Hazard Assessment, a Management Program, a Prevention Plan, and an Emergency Response Program. The Hazard Assessment includes a Worst Case Analysis, several Alternative Release Scenarios, and a 5-year Accident History. The Prevention Program consists of safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance procedures, incident investigations, and compliance audits. \n\nThe Pelron Plant is located at 7847 West 47th Street in Chicago Illinois. The facility's operation involves the manufacturing of feed stock products for the urethane plastics industry. This includes the manufacturing and packaging of various custom feed stocks leaving the plant in 5 to 55-gallon containers. The manufacturing process utilizes raw chemicals primarily consisting of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, formaldehyde, allyl alcohol and dimethylamine.  Raw materials for the process are received via tank truck and tank car.  Packaging materials are received by dray truck. Liquid raw materials are stored in tanks on the plant property both inside and outside. Packaged raw materials are stored on pallets in pallet racks until they are required in the manufacturing process. The products are manufactured in a batch process in reaction vessels of various sizes.  Finished products are stored in the tanks within the warehouse or in the vessels until they are packaged. The finished products are packages a variety of styles and they are stored "

Finished products are also loaded into bulk trucks and delivered to customers.\n\nThe Pelron plant currently operates in compliance with Illinois State Air Permit.  The Pelron Plant is also subject to Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Tier II filing for toxic chemicals. \n\nThe five chemicals stored at the Pelron Plant in quantities over the threshold values are Ethylene Oxide, Propylene Oxide, Formaldehyde, Allyl Alcohol and Dimethylamine.  They are brought in as raw materials and are essential in the production of various products. These materials are received in bulk either via rail car or tanker truck. Each is added at various times during the process at various temperatures and pressures. \n\nHazard Analysis\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nToxic Gas\nThe worst case scenario for the Pelron Plant has been determined to be an unloading or storage accident. Ethylene Oxide (EO) is delivered to the plant via rail car. The EO is stored in a 10,000- gallon storage tank on site.  The plant takes delivery of a 20,000-gallon rail car when the onsite storage tank has approximately 1500 gallons remaining.  For modeling purposes, it is assumed that the railcar tank is somehow emptied such that that the entire quantity of EO is released. For worst case, it is assumed that the EO is released into the atmosphere in a ten minute time period. EPA's Degadis computer model was used to model the toxic endpoint. Assumptions in the model are:\n\n     1) Wind Speed = 1.5 m/s\n     2) Stability Class = F\n     3) Air Temperature = 77 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nUsing the model, the toxic endpoint was estimated to occur at a distance of 4500 meters (2.80 miles)  from the center of the facility.  Estimated population in that radius is 124,345 people. The population was estimated using Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR)'s Offsite Receptor Report. This report also helped locate environmental and public receptors in the "

In this situation, it is assumed that the contents of the rail car is spilled resulting in a release of 180,000 pounds of dimethylamine in 10 minutes.  The conditions are assumed to be:\n1) Wind Speed = 1.5 m/s\n2) Stability Class = F\n3) Air Temperature = 77 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nThe resulting 1 PSI overpressure is estimated to be a 0.40 mile from the plant.  The estimated population within this area is 1445.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nEthylene Oxide \nAn unloading accident was assumed for this scenario.  In this situation, it is assumed that there is a break in a line from the rail car to the onsite storage tank.  The EO is pumped at a rate of 50-60 gallons per minute and it was assumed that it would take 2 minutes for the transfer pumps to be turned off and the valves shut.  No mitigation measures were used. Other assumptions in the release scenario are:\n     1) Wind Speed = 3.0 m/s\n     2) Stability Class = D\n     3) Air Temperature = 77 degrees Fahrenheit\nThe toxic endpoint was estimated to occur at a distance of 0.3 miles from the center of the facility. Estimated population in that radius is 820.\n\nPropylene Oxide\nIt was assumed that a valve or transfer hose malfunctions during unloading and 120 gallons of propylene oxide were released onto the ground. The release rate of the chemical is 60 gallons per minute. No mitigation measures were used.

Estimated population in that radius is 360.\n\nD9imethylamine (Flammable gas)\nAs with the formaldehyde, this alternate scenario is based on an actual release scenario.  7500 pounds of 37% formaldehyde had been placed in a reaction vessel for reacting.  Another 7500 pounds of dimethylamine is placed in the reaction vessel.  This reaction must be cooled and in this accidental release situation, cooling did not accord due to a frozen water value on the tank.  As a result, the pressure inside the reaction vessel is exceeded resulting in the pressure release value releasing.  The release rate of the chemical is 750 pounds per minute. No mitigation measures were used. Other assumptions in the release scenario are:\n1) Wind Speed = 3.0 m/s\n     2) Stability Cla"
