              "Description": "       WEATHERFORD EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR CHLORINE RELEASE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  City of  Weatherford/Weatherford Public works Authority  is in the Custer County  Emergency  Response Program which details all necessary programs to move people, maintain law enforcement, handle medical emergencies, notify the public, of danger and  precautions to take. Public notification can be handled through local television, radio, and mobile public address systems. In the event of an actual chlorine release (worst case scenario, 4000 pounds in ten minutes)  at the Weatherford Wastewater treatment  facility the operator in charge will call 911 and  inform the dispatcher of the chemical release.  Noting  the severity of the release  and the anticipated amount, the wind direction and request notification of all emergency responders listed in the Custer County  Emergency Plan. \n\n\n\nIn the typical release scenario  prescribed by the USEPA the affected area would be 4.2 miles down wind  from the  release.  If the wind were from the South the entire City of Weatherford  may have to be evacuated for a short time.  The major high occupancy  facilities to be notified would include:\n\n\n\nCovenient Care Clinic at 580-774-4681 \n\nWeatherford Regional Hospital at 580-772-5551\n\n(Both hospitals can shut off all air intakes to minimize chemicals entering this facility.)\n\n\n\nAce Hardware at 580-7727781\n\n\n\nTractor Supply at 580-772-2168\n\n\n\nCorn Heritage Village at 580-772-3993\n\n\n\nKodak 580-774-3526            \n\n\n\nWal Mart at 580-772-1408\n\n\n\nUnited Supermarkets at 580-772-3982\n\n\n\nWeatherford Public Schools at 580-772-3327\n\n\n\nSouthwestern Oklahoma State University at 580-772-6611\n\n\n\nWeatherford Living Center at 580-774-1239\n\n\n\nWeatherford Assisted Living Center at 580-774-2955\n\n\n\nWeatherford Shopping Center  at 580-772-5661\n\n\n\nIf the wind were from any other direction a house by house  notification would be necessary because of the sparse population. \n\n\n\nThe operator in charge would, upon completion of notification of the release, proceed to perform or oversee the installation of the emergency kit on the chlorine tank to contain as much chemical as possible. All persons in the immediate area of the release shall use all the personal protective gear available while installing the emergency kit\n\n\n\nWhen the release is contained notification of authorities is to be performed. \n\n\n\nThe National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802\n\nThe Oklahoma Emergency Response Commission at 405-521-2481\n\nThe local response center will have already been notified by the 911 operator.\n\n\n\nThe verbal information that should be included in this report is as follows:\n\n\n\nCompany name;\n\n\n\nName of caller;\n\n\n\nChemical released ( mention that  it is chlorine and that it is on the Extremely Hazardous List);   \n\n\n\nDate and time,  and duration  of release;\n\n\n\nEstimate of the amount of chlorine released;\n\n\n\nInformation as to weather the release has stopped or continues;\n\n\n\nThe medium into which the release occurred, (air, land or water);\n\n\n\nAny known or anticipated  acute or chronic health risk associated  with the emergency and, where appropriate advice regarding medical attention for exposed individuals. ( Health Hazard Data and First Aid information from the Current chlorine Material Safety Data Sheet may be utilized;\n\n\n\nProper precautions to take as a result of the release, including evacuation; \n\n\n\nWind speed, direction; and\n\n\n\nName and telephone of person to contact for further information. \n\n\n\nIf any agency notified has emergency response capabilities and/or responsibilities, it should be informed of any assistance needed.\n\n\n\nA written follow-up emergency notice is required as soon as practical after a reportable release. This document should:\n\n \n\nSet forth  and update the verbal information given previously;\n\n\n\nDiscuss action taken to respond to and contain the release;\n\n\n\nDiscuss any known or anticipated  acute or chronic health risk associated with the release; and\n\n\n\nWhere appropriate, give advice regarding medical attention for exposed individuals.\n\n\n\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Custer County  Sheriffs Department, Lifeguard Ambulance Services, Weatherford Police Department and The Weatherford Fire Department will all be coordinated by Weatherford Police Chief Louis Flowers who is the  County  Emergency Response Director. Traffic detour plans and evacuation plans  and other emergency plans are in place under the direction of Chief Brown as written in the Custer County Emergency Operations Plan.\n\n\n\nIn an alternate release scenario a small amount of chlorine, (more than 10 pounds at a rate of  one pound  per minute) is released and  the controlled  without major incident a report of the release is required to:\n\n\n\nNational Response Center at 1-800-424-8802;\n\nOklahoma Emergency Response Center at 1- 405-521-2481\n\nCuster County Emergency Response Coordinator.1-580-772-7791\n\n\n\nIn a small slow release as described , all chemical would be retained on the plant site and only plant personnel and plant visitors would have the possibility of exposure and 911 could be call for emergency help or treatment if necessary.  All of the appropriate information listed  in the Worst Case Scenario  report should be reported for the Alternate  Release Scenario.\n\n\n\nFirst aid for chlorine inhalation victims would include removing the victim to a chlorine free area and elevating the head and trunk 45 to 60 degrees. If breathing has stopped CPR should be administered.  If available humidified oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel. If liquid chlorine has contaminated the skin  or clothing  the clothing should be removed under an emergency shower. The skin  should be flushed with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Thermal burns from exposure to liquid  chlorine can be more damaging to the skin than chemical reactions. A physician  may need to check irritated skin areas. If eyes are exposed to strong concentrations of chlorine they should be flushed with tepid water for at least 15 minutes and if irritation persist check with  physician.",

The chlorine is stored in a restricted, fenced area to prevent vandalism or accidental/incidental contact with the chlorine containers or feed equipment. There are two, one-ton cylinders and normally only 14, 150-pound cylinders on site with a possibility of 20, 150-pound cylinders maximum at any given time; for a total of 7,000 pounds of chlorine on site.  Both one-ton cylinders have the protective hoods removed at the same time, this is to allow for the application of the feeding mechanism to insure automatic and continuous chlorine feeding during crossover from the empty cylinder to the full cylinder. However, only one of the cylinders will have the valve open at one time except during the crossover period, which should not exceed more than a few hours.  The 150-pound cylinders are only stored in the Chlorine building and are not part of the chlorination process. All of the 150-pound cyclinders will have the vales closed and protective hoods on and chained in place. This in effect helps protect the environment from the probability of a release of the worst-case scenario magnitude.\n\n\n\nThere are procedures and equipment in place to contain a chlorine release and to warn the public if necessary for health and safety purposes. All emergency procedures are coordinated through Weatherford Police Chief, Louis Flowers who is also the Custer County Emergency Management Coordinator. All Custer County emergency services are available to Weatherford upon need. The operator in charge has written policy to follow in the event of a chemical release. The first of which is to call 911 for notification and assistance and then to contain the leak.\n\n\n\nWeatherford has a two million gallon per day wastewater treatment facility and is required by "

Chlorine injected into the wastewater at the introduction of the effluent basin disinfects the effluent water prior to reintroduction to the environment. Sulfur dioxide, injected into the chlorinated water at the exit point of the effluent basin, neutralizes the chlorine, leaving chemical free water returning to the environment. \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention is an on going daily practice as all operators observe good operations procedures, such as using fresh lead gaskets when making chlorine connections and protecting the pressurized containers from traffic and direct sun. The chlorine containers are inside a chain link fenced area to minimize access by vandals and traffic. Operators also go through bi-annual training and do hands-on exercises to demonstrate use of the emergency kit and associated safety equipment.  \n\n\n\nWeatherford has not had a reportable chemical release in the last five years.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a chemical release, the operator in charge would call 911 to notify the local emergency responders and to activate the Custer County Emergency Responders. The operators would attempt to stop the release with the emergency kit. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, the Custer County Sheriffs Department, The Weatherford Police Department, the Southwestern Oklahoma State University Police Department and the auxiliaries of these departments would go into action to block and reroute traffic away from the affected area as well as assist with evacuation if needed and public notification.
