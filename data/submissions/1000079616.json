      "SummaryText": " Executive Summary Lufkin Plant\n\n\n\n1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  (40 CFR 68.145 Subpart G):  \n\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals, LLC. (GPC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific LLC, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas. The manufacturing facility is located on East Lufkin Avenue. The manufacturing facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1962 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins. The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1977. Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm.   Overall, the facility employs 58 full-time employees.\n\n\n\nGPC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n\n\nA prevention program to "

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nGPC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nGPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nGPC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPC trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPC works with the local fire department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule."

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPC is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPC implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPC provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the local voluntary fire department.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GPC established a management system headed by the facility safety coordinator, to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Plant handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule (Formaldehyde)\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis:  \n\nThe OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1962, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1993, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:  \n\n\n\nThe"
