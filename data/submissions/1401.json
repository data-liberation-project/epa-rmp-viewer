We handle a variety of farm chemicals and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia that is considered an EHS material and regulated by EPA.  We distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.\nWehave one 30,000 gallon stationary storage tank for anhydrous ammonia at our facility.  This tank would contain 130,050 pounds of anhydrous ammonia if filled to its maximum allowable quanitiy.\n\nWorse Case Scenario\n\nOur worse case scenario would be the loss of the entire contents of our 30,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over aten minute period resulting in total vaporization of the material.  The maximum quanitiy released would be 130,050 pounds of material  resulting in an off-site impact.  Fayette County Co-op has never experienced this type of a release.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario would be a transfer hose failure resulting in a two minute release until manual shut down could be completed.  This would result in a release of 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Fayette County Co-op has never experienced this type of release.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accident in the last fiv"
