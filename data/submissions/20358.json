ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n    The Hamakua PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The Hamakua PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia storage and use system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Facility Manager and the Ammonia Storage and Use System Operators, have been deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Honokaa, Hawaii facility safely.\n\n     The Hamakua Emergency Response Program has been developed with the cooperation and support of the Hilo Fire Department.  All Hamakua employees have received documented ammonia awareness training.  \n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n      Hamakua Energy Partners Manages an SCR Process for NOx Removal.  The ammonia storage and use system is a necessity for the processing, storage and distribution of electric energy.  The ammonia storage and use system contains no more than 45,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenar"

Under worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to 0.1 mile before dispersing. This release is very, very unlikely to occur during the life of the Hamakua Energy Partners facility.\n\n     An alternative case release that we call MOST LIKELY, MOST SEVERE was slightly more likely still. A 100 pound ammonia loss from a failing ammonia transfer hose during the unloading operation.\n     Under worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .1 mile before dispersing\n     This release is very unlikely to occur during the life of the Hamakua Energy Partners facility.\n\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE HAMAKUA ENERGY PARTNERS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n      Hamakua Energy Partners will conduct an annual training and response exercise with the Hilo Fire Department to practice, train and update the Hamakua Emergency Response Program.\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners will conduct an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit of the entire PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.   Hamakua Energy Partners considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n      Hamakua Energy Partners empha"

Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Hamakua Ammonia System Operators have been trained to respond defensively to an accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Hilo Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n       Hamakua Energy Partners recognizes that their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of living documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before Safety becomes second nature.\n\n       Hamakua Energy Partners expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program\n\n          (1)     Employee Participation is the Key to a successful program.  Both Management and the Ammonia Storage and Use System Operators will be deeply involved in Verifying the P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections."
