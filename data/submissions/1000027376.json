If a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Green Bay Fire Department, (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.4 miles by road) as well as the Brown County Local Emergency Planning Committee, as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual hazardous materials refresher training.  \n\n\n\nThe U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal is a bulk petroleum terminal that stores refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel oil, and denatured ethanol.  Two pressurized, 30-gallon, above ground storage tanks, as well as butane blending equipment have been installed and will begin operating at the facility in April 2012.  The maximum quantity of butane that will be stored onsite is 51,000 gallons, which exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.  \n\n\n\nThe process covered under Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations consists of the butane blending system, which includes the two storage tanks and associated piping. The facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 77 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.4 miles and includes public receptors. The facility's alternate (most likely resulting in off-site impacts) release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.1 miles at 1PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but affects no residential areas. The U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal complies with the U. S. Environ"

To date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane that has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving the U.S. Venture, Inc. -  U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Green Bay Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility emergency response plans have been coordinated with the fire department and the Brown County LEPC. The Green Bay Fire Department is aware of the butane blending process.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Venture, Inc. is updating the facility alarm system so that in the event of a butane related emergency, a different alarm will sound than in the event of an emergency in other areas of the terminal.  (The alarm is tied into the emergency shut-down for the butane equipment.)  A camera will be installed to monitor any activities at the butane offload skid and all components of the butane storage and blending process will be enclosed in a locked, fenced area, restricting access to authorized individuals.\n\n"
