      "SummaryText": "Prepared By: Mandy Adamson\n\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nOur employees will do what is possible with their training to stop the release, but will not be emergency\n\nresponders. Both the Eads County Volunteer Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee will be implemented as emergency responders for major evacuations.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe NH3 facility is located directly east of the Eads, CO.  Eads Consumers Supply Co., Inc. receives, stores, and occasionally delivers anhydrous ammonia to farmers as an agricultural nutrient.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nWorst case scenario would release 52,530 pounds in a 10 minute period or 5,300 pounds per minute with\n\na .55 mile to end point. Alternate release could involve a transfer hose rupture this would result in a release\n\nof 7,127 pounds in a 2 minute period with a .46 mile to end point.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\n\nEads Consumers Supply Co., Inc. recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by both State and Federal agencies and have regular training for our employees. The most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers: An example would be a nurse trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Eads Consumers Supply Co., Inc.'s policy is never fill nurse tanks above 85%.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Eads Consumers Supply Co., Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan and an Overall Emergency Coordinator. All areas have worked with the County, City and Insurance Company Loss Control Department for the development of these plans.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Safety Changes\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Manager tours the anhydrous ammonia plant regularly. Changes are made on an as needed basis as new regulations or concerns arise.\n\n"
