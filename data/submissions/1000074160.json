The Adipic Acid unit was decommissioned during the 4th quarter 2015 and is now limited to storage facilities for anhydrous ammonia. In the production of HMD and ADN, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials, intermediates, or by-products:\n\n- Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\n- Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater)\n\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n\n- 1,3-Butadiene\n\nA barge dock was commissioned on August 28, 2015 for supplying 1,3-Butadiene to the ADN production unit or sending 1,3-Butadiene offsite. The barge dock is manned whenever a barge with 1,3-Butadiene is at the barge dock. The barge dock has controlled entry, is secured by a chain-link fence, and the area is under video camera surveillance from the ADN unit control room. The U.S. Coast Guard conducts periodic inspections of the facility. The most recent inspection was conducted on September 11, 2019 by the U.S. Coast Guard. \n\nIn September 2018, INV Nylon Chemicals Americas - Orange Site Nylon C eliminated chlorine 1-ton containers used for water treatment from the ADN process, which eliminated a significant risk to the community and demonstrated INV Nylon Chemicals Americas - Orange Site's commitment to Environmental Stewardship. \n\n\n\n1.2 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL- SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe regulated substances and corresponding processes at INV Nylon Chemicals Americas - Orange Site are also regulated under the OSHA PSM standard. The PSM and RMP programs share common accidental release prevention requirements and corresponding program elements. In complying with the PSM standard, INV Nylon Chemicals Americas - Orange Site has taken the necessary steps to comply with the applicable accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\nINV Nylon Chemicals Americas - Orange Site's Accidental Re"
