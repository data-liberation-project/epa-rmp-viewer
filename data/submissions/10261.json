PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe White River Dome Compressor Station processes approximately eight mmscf/day of coal bed methane gas.  The station provides compression, dehydration, carbon dioxide extraction, and recovery of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.  The facility uses a two-stage permeable memberane carbon dioxide extraction plant to remove both carbon dioxide and water from the inlet gas.  Hydrocarbons that diffuse through the first membrane with the carbon dioxide are recovered when this \"permeate\" stream is sent through a second permeable membrane at a higher pressure.\n\nThe station has two 30,000 gallon hydrocarbon product tanks, with a maximum intended inventory of 151,800 pounds in each.  There is also one 12,000 gallon condensate tank with a maximum intended inventory of 60,720 pounds.  Filling of the tanks is administratively limited to 80% of tank capacity by NFPA 58 requirements, as corrected for facility elevation.\n\nThe RMP-regulated portion of the facility includes carbon dioxide removal, the J-T skid, and liquid hydrocarbon storage.  The DOT-regulated p"

      "SummaryText": "ortion of the facility includes initial compression and separation.\n\nThis is a remote, unmanned facility exempt from OSHA PSM requirements.  However, PSC operators perform periodic system checks and maintenance at the plant.\n\nRelease Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario has been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one of the 30,000 gallon hydrocarbon product tanks or 151,8000 pounds) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion) was determined to be 0.431 miles using the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Table 9.  There are no residences, or public or environmental receptors within a 0.431 mile radius around the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Hydrocarbon Product and Natural Gas Condensate\nSince this facility qualifies for Program 1 compliance, there are no regulatory requirements for a prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the White River Dome Compressor Station RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general"

The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical and process safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
