              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 1 - U.S. Amines:\n\n\n\nThe plant is subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and the EPA-RMP program. The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA-RMP rule. Amines Plant No. 1 includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n1. Ammonia\n\n2. Dimethylamine\n\n3. Isopropylamine\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\nOperations of the storage locations for ammonia and the operations using ammonia fall under the site PSM program. Ammonia is stored as a liquefied gas. There are three storage tanks for pure ammonia which do not have storage containment dikes because dikes would not contain the ammonia from evaporation. Storage for ammonia within the process unit does include dikes as the ammonia stored in the process is not pure and dikes would contain some of the material that would not immediately evaporate. The storage areas are serviced by fire water spray nozzles that would be used in the event of a large spill. Ammonia is readily soluble in water and water would be effective in mitigating a large spill.\n\n\n\nDimethylamine\n\nOperations of the storage locations and the blending process of dimethylamine fall under the site PSM program. Dimethylamine is stored in railcars and iso-containers. The railcar area has a pan that drains to our wastewater treatment process. The storage areas are serviced by fire water spray nozzles that would be used in the event of a large spill. Dimethylamine is readily soluble in water and water would be effective in mitigating a large spill.\n\n\n\nIsopropylamine\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production of isopropylamine fall under the site PSM program. The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems. The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents. The storage areas are serviced by fire water spray nozzles that would be used in the event of a large spill. Isopropylamine is readily soluble in water and water would be effective in mitigating a large spill.\n\n\n\nThe site PSM program has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP rules.\n\nSome of those policies are listed below:\n\n1. Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service. In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n\n2. Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n\n3. Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk. This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n\n4. The plant belongs to and participates in the Mobile County EMA, the local county emergency planning committee. The plant also participates in the local Lemoyne Community\n\nAdvisory Panel (LCAP), a group of local chemical and industrial facilities that meet with the community several times per year to discuss safety and risk management issues within the local industrial park.\n\n5. All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, to maintain safe operation.\n\n6. The plant has numerous recorded video surveillance cameras for added security.\n\n7. Employee training programs covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues. This includes monthly safety meetings, monthly computer based training classes, annual and tri-annual training, and recertification programs.\n\n8. All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n\n9. The plant has an extensive firefighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n\n10. The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination\n\nmaterials.\n\n11. The plant alarm system and fire water systems are tested weekly.\n\n12. Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.\n\n13. Equipment is maintained with routine inspections and preventative maintenance. \n\n",

Cyclohexylamine\n\n2. Propionitrile\n\n\n\nCyclohexylamine\n\nOperations of these storage locations and production of cyclohexylamine fall under the site PSM program. The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems. The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all the tank contents.\n\n\n\nPropionitrile\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production operations using propionitrile fall under the site PSM program. The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems. The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all the tank contents. Special personal protective equipment is used with propionitrile to prevent absorption of liquid or vapors into the skin. The vapor space of the storage tank is purged with nitrogen to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere condition.\n\n\n\nThe site PSM program has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP rules.\n\nSome of those policies are listed below:\n\n1. Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service. In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n\n2. Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n\n3. Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process to provide more consistent evaluation of risk. This provides better guidance in reducing risk,\n\nover the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n\n4. The plant belongs to and participates in the Mobile County EMA, the local county emergency planning committee. The plant also participates in the local Lemoyne Community\n\nAdvisory Panel (LCAP), a group of local chemical and industrial facilities that meet with the community several times per year to discuss safety and risk management issues within the local industrial park.\n\n5. All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, to maintain safe operation.\n\n6. The plant has numerous recorded video surveillance cameras for added security.\n\n7. Employee training programs covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues. This includes monthly safety meetings, monthly computer based training classes, annual and tri-annual training, and recertification programs.\n\n8. All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n\n9. The plant has an extensive firefighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n\n10. The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination\n\nmaterials.\n\n11.

Like our local community and industrial neighbors, U.S. Amines' fifty site employees want a clean, safe environment with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play. That is why U.S. Amines has a \"zero-incidents\" goal. The zero-incidents goal is a commitment to reducing emissions and having zero injuries and zero environmental incidents. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. Amines Bucks' Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in operations. The Lemoyne Community Advisory Panel was one of the first community advisory panels established in the United States. The Lemoyne Industrial Park companies have been recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation. This continued partnership ensures the community is a safe place now and in the future. \n\n\n\nU.S. Amines manufactures several different chemicals called alkyl amines. These alkyl amines go into the production of agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and pharmaceutical compounds. For example, the product isopropylamine is a combination of isopropyl alcohol and ammonia, and isopropylamine gets sold to other chemical facilities that produce herbicides. Regulated substances held at the stationary source, U.S. Amines, are as follows: toxic substances, ammonia, propionitrile, and cyclohexylamine; flammable substances, dimethylamine and isopropylamine. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program actions include, but are not limited to, transfer operations being visually monitored; tanks, valves, hoses, pumps, piping, and safety devices being properly maintained and kept in good operating condition; commercial carriers following correct procedures when unloading or loading and remaining with their equipment at all times. \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevent"

These are policies outlined in a manual available plant-wide.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific accidental release prevention program actions for regulated substances include dikes and pans. The ammonia storage tanks do not use dikes due to evaporation. Dimethylamine transfer from rail car to iso-container makes use of a pan draining to wastewater to prevent the accidental release of dimethylamine during transfer. Isopropylamine, cyclohexylamine, and propionitrile storage tanks do make use of dikes. All storage tanks of the chemicals are routinely inspected to maintain the mechanical integrity. Ammonia, dimethylamine, and isopropylamine are all readily soluble in water, which would help with mitigating an accidental release.\n\n\n\nIf there is an accidental release, the priority is to evaluate the safety of plant personnel and to determine if outside assistance is needed. Then, the containment procedures and incident reporting procedures are followed. If the substance is flammable, foam or other suitable substances are to be applied to the released substance to prevent ignition and aid in vapor control. All storm and sanitary drains are covered to prevent the released material from flowing offsite. The containment area is barricaded and secured to prevent entry and possible injury. A site-specific incident report is completed, and if needed, an incident report"
