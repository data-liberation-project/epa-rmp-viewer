              "Description": "The P&O Cold Logistics hazardous material release prevention program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigerated systems. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed andinstalled in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, Pressure Vessel codes and all other applicable design safety standards. In order for this sytem to function safely and efectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional effciency. Maintenance monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up running and emergency shut-down. Also built in to the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, tempetatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.  Operator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis \"What if\" study helps operators and emergency responders undestand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safely and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lockout/Tagout procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctionaing equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system. Spill containment and clean-up training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures. Annual safety audits include evaluations and recommendatins for updating and improving the program.",

Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of all Versacold facilities located in California, to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Versacold implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nVersacold is located at 1415 N Raymond Ave in the city of Anaheim, California The area immediately surrounding the facility is commercial.\n\nThe primary business of Versacold is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 13500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage, and glycol underfloor heating.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Versacold to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Versacold employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic "

This prevents the quantity release from escalating.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Versacold Chief Engineer.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years (June 1999 - June 2004.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- Save lives;\n- Minimize and avoid injuries;\n- Protect the environment; and\n- Minimize property damage.\n\nFacility personnel will respond to an ammonia release at the facility which poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPrior to the system being filled with ammonia, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA of the refrigeration system consisted of a:\n\n- Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n- Series of safety checklists; and\n- Facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues including wind sock locations, posting of maps, and conducting drills with facility personnel following startup.\n\nThis technical assessment was conducted to fulfill the Hazard Assessmen"
