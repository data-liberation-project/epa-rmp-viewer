Philips has global policies related to the Health and Safety of employees, sustainable operations within the community both locally and globally, as well as Environmental Policies outlining the commitment to pollution prevention\nPhilips Lumileds is committed to maintaining a safe work environment. The EHS Department for the Philips Lumileds San Jose site ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has well-established emergency procedures and an active Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, including response to emergencies related to the regulated substances covered by this RMP. This team has participated with the gas supplier in joint drills to practice the use of the emergency response equipment that is specific to the bulk ammonia ISO modules. On a periodic basis as recent as May of 2010, Philips hosted the local engine companies, as well as the San Jose Hazardous Incidence Team to tour the facility and become familiar with the operations, emergency equipment and response capabilities from the on-site response team.  The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Philips Lumileds employees, the public, and the environment in the event of a hazardous material release.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:  \nThis facility is located at 370 West Trimble Road in San Jose, California.  With operations in two buildings and an additional support building, the overall facility consists of a little over half a million square feeton a campus of 84 acres.\nThis facility is a light emitting diode (LED) manufacturing and R&D operation with the production capacity for billions of lamps annually.

      "SummaryText": ", significant quantities of anhydrous ammonia are used in the process of growing Indium Gallium Nitride upon sapphire substrates.  The InGaN is the basis for the green to blue frequencies of light as well as the phosphor converted white, soft white and amber colors.  The ammonia is the nitrogen source for this process.\n\nAccidental release prevention steps: \nThe operations of this facility are regulated by agencies across the spectrum of jurisdiction: City, County, Special Districts, State, and Federal.  From local building & fire codes, to California hazardous waste treatment and storage requirements up to Federal transportation, OSHA, and EPA requirements.  The bulk of the engineering and effort have been in the upfront preventive measures to minimize the release of all hazardous materials \u00c2\u00bf but with particular attention paid to the bulk ammonia distribution system. Some of the engineering controls built into the system include fully welded lines, exhausted enclosures for all mechanical fittings, gas monitoring, excess flow shutoff, restrictive flow orifices, emergency abatement equipment, dedicated specialized emergency response equipment, as well as training, operational procedures and a preventive maintenance program.  By using complete trailer rigs, we avoid the offloading of bulk hazardous materials into onsite storage containers \u00c2\u00bf which is the most likely release scenario.\n\nFive year accident history:\n There have been no accidental releases related to the processes covered by this RMP.\n\nEmergency response program:\n In addition to engineering controls designed to avoid single component point of failure leading to a release, and the stand by emergency abatement solution, this facility maintains an on-site emergency response team (ERT) trained and equipped to deal with a failure of the containment.  The team has been trained by the manufacturer on how to install the emergency containment cap to contain any leaks from the valve assembly at the top of the tank."
