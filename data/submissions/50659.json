      "SummaryText": "Per Section 112\u00ae of the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the final Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program Rule on June 20, 1996.  This rule was published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996 and codifed in the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68, as amended).\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) document was prepared for the facility located at 900 Hensley Lane in Wylie, Texas.  Plant documents (plans, maps, etc.) and appropriate facility personnel were consulted in the preparation of this plan.\n\nBased on an analysis of the facility, the toluene diisocyanate (TDI) system used in the polyurethane coatings production process was determined to be the covered process chemical because the quantity of TDI stored at the facility exceeds 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe facility is subject to Program 1 requirements because the offsite consequence analysis that was performed indicated no offsite impact from the TDI system.  Additionally, there have been no accidents with offsite consequences in the 5 years prior to the original RMP submittal nor have there been any accidents with offsite consequences since the facility started operation in about March 2002.  The hypothetical worst-case accident for the TDI system is a liquid spill during shipping receipt or handling of a 55-gallon TDI drum and vaporization of from the resulting liquid pool that could result in impacts.  Results of the hazard assessment conducted using Complex Hazardous Air Release Model (CHARM), version 9.3, conservatively calculates that the furthest distance to the toxic endpoint of a worst-case spill for TDI remains within the plant boundaries.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone and thus a Program 1 Risk Management Program is required."
