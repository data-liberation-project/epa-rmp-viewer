As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the two (2) high pressure receivers.\n\n\n\nThe Process 1 refrigeration system was built more than twenty-five years ago, but since that time the following projects have occurred:\n\nMay 2011 - Ice Makers were moved and a vertical liquid recirc package was installed outside to feed them\n\nMay 2012 - NH3 Plus installed a new evaporative condenser\n\nJuly 2012 - APCCO installed Blast Cooler #4 and a new high pressure receiver\n\nOctober 2014 - NH3 Plus removed the boiler room recirculator and repiped Blast Tunnel 4 so that it is now served from the Turkey Room Recirculator\n\n1.2.2 Process 2\n\n\n\nProcess 2 provides refrigeration capacity to the following areas:\n\nCooler\n\n(2) Freezers\n\nStaging Area\n\nAir Chill Room\n\n43?F Processing Room\n\n70?F Processing Room\n\n\n\nThe Process 2 refrigeration system is equipped with air-cooling evaporators and pump recirculators as required for pumped overfeed operation.

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the main suction accumulator and then the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe refrigeration system was built in 2015-2016 by Cold Storage Technologies.

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 78,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equip"

Nevertheless, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.
