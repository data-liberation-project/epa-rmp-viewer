Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports field per IDNR requirements.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with RMP covered processes at the BRRWB facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nBRRWB ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan AND Facility Response Plan.  BRRWB has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facility Emergency Action Plan. The Plans listed as part of this Executive Summary have been prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nBRRWB provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.

A worst case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.7 mile radius. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiles (CAPS)which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. hospitals, schools, etc) was obtained using Google Earth. Spring Creek is located within the worst-case distance to endpoint for denaturant.  \n\nAlternative Scenario:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were 0.1 miles. Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth.  \n\nThe BRRWB facility qualifies as a Program 3 for flammable mixture for RMP/PSM purposes. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nPlease review the first se"

This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs. \n\nBRRWB has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\nBRRWB's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nBRRWB ethanol plant is located in West Burlington, Des Moines County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance stored at the facility is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant). \n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst Case Scenario:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. De"
