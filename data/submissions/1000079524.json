This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorination and dechlorination systems. The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Ventura Water Reclamation Facility employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination facility utilizing sulfur dioxide.  The Chemical Building is located on the southeast side of the property, which houses both the chlorination and dechlorination systems and includes a multi-media scrubber in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The chlorination system consists of a gaseous chlorine storage and feed system.  The storage room contains two scales, each configured with three one-ton chlorine cylinders, for a total of six one-ton cylinders.  Additionally, up to nine unconnected cylinders are stored on trunnions within the storage room.  Thus, a total of up to fifteen gaseous chlorine one-ton cylinders are located on site at any given time.  The dechlorination system consists of a gaseous sulfur dioxide storage and feed system.  Six one-ton cylinders of gaseous sulfur dioxide are connected to the process and the remaining six cylinders are available for storage.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nAs part of the implementation of RMP, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n- Process Safety Inf"

      "SummaryText": "ormation - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has compiled process safety information for the chlorination and dechlorination processes. This information includes details regarding process chemicals, technology, and equipment used in the handling, storage and processing of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Additionally, this compiled process safety information is used in the PSM program as a resource for the teams performing process hazard analyses.  The information is also helpful for developing training and emergency response programs.\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis - The Process Hazard Analysis is performed to identify hazards in a process. Through this process, information is obtained that will help improve process safety and system reliability, as well as reducing the potential consequences of accidental releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  The HAZOP and What-If?/Checklist methodology has been selected as the most appropriate PHA method in conducting the PHA for the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  The PHA team includes operations representatives, as well as a facilitator knowledgeable in the methodology employed.\r\n- Operating Procedures - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has developed written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, including startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  The operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be taken. The facility takes steps to update the procedures to reflect current operations and the procedures are certified annually by the operating staff. In addition, operating procedures are updated when there are any changes in the process as a result of the management of change procedures.\r\n- Training - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has implemented a training program for operations perso"

In addition to the safety practices of the facility and personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. The facility also has safety systems in place to protect personnel such as emergency scrubbers automatically activated by gas detection, safety showers, respiratory equipment, and chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  The facility will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders.  Additionally, in order to prepare for emergencies the facility has filed a Chemical Inventory Business Plan with the local Fire Department and this plan includes:\r\n-\tEmergency Alarm Procedures\r\n-\tEvacuation Procedures\r\n-\tSafety and Health Considerations\r\n-\tNotification Procedures\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Ventura Water Reclamation Facility is extremely diligent in the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.

The equipment used to process, transfer or store the chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.  Contractors play an integral role in servicing the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\r\n- Management of Change - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has implemented a Management of Change (MOC) procedure to manage changes to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. Changes are defined as modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, or processing conditions other than replacement in kind.\r\n- Pre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review is carried out in conjunction with an MOC or a new project or construction. The PSSR is conducted before implementing a modification to a process.\r\n- Compliance Audits - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility performs compliance audits every three years to verify the implementation of the prevention program elements, including a review of program documentation and records to verify implementation.\r\n- Incident Investigation - The Incident Investigation program at the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility is implemented to identify the cause of incidents and to prevent or minimize their recurrence. A multi-disciplinary team is assembled to gather the facts of the events and to identify, to the extent possible, the cause of the incident.  Team members are selected on the basis of their training, knowledge, and ability to contribute to a team.\r\n- Employee Participation - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has instituted an employee participation program to consult with the employees in the development and implementation of all the Process Safety Management (PSM) elements and employee participati"

The hazards identified for the work being performed are communicated to those personnel performing the work, and also to those personnel who may be affected by the work being performed, especially when the work being performed could affect the safety of the process. \r\n- Contractors - The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has established a contractor safety program as a screening process that helps identify and select contractors who will perform work in and around the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Such contractors must have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and certifications for the job tasks which they are being employed. The facility obtains information on injury and illness rates and references regarding the contractor as part of the selection process.
