The refinery has a thoroughly trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record. The refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nWilliams Refining has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and contain the release. \n\nTo comply with the RMP standard we have focused upon the following: \n\n* Maintaining the management system established by PSM\n* Adapting the system to address RMP\n* Performing the hazard assessments\n* Compiling the data elements\n* Communicating with the public concerning RMP issues. \n\nAll of the refinery process units are currently managed under the PSM standard. Therefore these processes are, in effect, being managed as RMP Program Level 3 processes.\n\nRMP threshold quantities of flammable mixtures containing Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) such as propane, butanes, propylene, butylenes, etc. are present on site. In addition, a threshold quantity of hydrofluoric acid, an RMP-regulated toxic substance, is used on site.\n\nPublic Communication of RMP\n\nWilliams Refining assumed a leadership role in organizing a comm"

The Memphis-Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) was the lead agency in this effort. Williams Refining, 11 other area companies, and numerous federal, state, and local regulatory and emergency response agencies participated in the symposium. Each company or agency prepared a booth with informational literature and displays. Persons ready and willing to discuss RMP, safety programs, or answer public questions staffed the booths. Expert speakers, emergency response equipment, and live demonstrations of Shelter-in-Place and HAZMAT response were also featured. We estimate that 600 people attended the symposium.\n\nThe refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP) to identify effective means for communicating RMP/safety information to our immediate neighboring community. CAP members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to distribute our RMP-related printed materials at various venues in the community. Williams Refining and the CAP members agree that RMP/safety communication should be an ongoing effort.\n\nHazard Assessment Results - Identification of Scenarios\n\nThe toxic and flammable worst case scenarios for the refinery were relatively easy to identify. Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is the only covered toxic that is present in a threshold quantity. All HF in the refinery is in the Alkylation Unit. The largest inventory of RMP flammables is, by far, in the LPG spheres.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid Release Scenarios and Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe EPA-defined toxic worst case scenario (WCS) at the refinery is a catastrophic loss of containment of the largest possible inventory of HF. All of our prevention and mitigation systems must be assumed to fail in this scenario. Weather conditions for the release must be assumed to be adverse to dissipation of the HF by wind, rain, or other action. The WCS for HF involves the simultaneous release of"

Such a release would create a vapor cloud that would travel in the direction of the wind. As the cloud traveled away from the site, it would become less concentrated and less harmful. The estimated maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 16 miles. Although we have numerous systems to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for prevention or mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nThe ARS for HF is a gasket leak under pressure that goes undiscovered for two hours. In that time about 5760 lbs. of hydrofluoric acid could escape. Upon discovery of the leak, a water stream would be used to remove acid vapors from the air. Although the release would spread in much the same way as in the worst case scenario, the quantity of the chemical released is much less. The estimated maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 0.31 miles (1640 ft.), assuming that there was no breeze to quickly dilute the release. It is very unlikely that the release described above could go undetected for two hours. However, EPA requires that the alternative case release scenario (ARS) reach an offsite endpoint. \n\nFlammable Release Scenarios and Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe flammable WCS at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the two largest LPG storage tanks, containing Butanes/Butylenes (B/B) Mix. Because of the proximity of the two tanks, we reasoned that a catastrophic VCE from either of the tanks might cause a catastrophic failure of the other tank. Therefore, the WCS is estimated using the full inventory of both tanks combined. B/B Mix was chosen as the worst case flammable because this mixture has the greatest explosive energy of the LPG mixtures stored on site. Other LPG mixtures con"

Weather conditions for the release must be assumed to be adverse to dissipation of the flammable gas by wind, rain, or other action. The full inventory of both tanks, about 10,200,000 lb., is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The estimated maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 1.8 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases, no credit for prevention measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe flammable ARS at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a 10-minute venting of B/B Mix through the 4-inch pressure relief valve atop the storage sphere. This pressure relief valve is set at 280 psi. In 10 minutes about 430,000 lbs. of B/B Mix could escape. The estimated maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.27 miles (1400 ft). The venting would be stopped by diverting process flow to a different LPG tank, or by opening a valve to another LPG tank.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWilliams Refining has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. No incident has resulted in offsite effects (deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage) as defined by EPA's RMP guidelines (RMP-covered process and RMP-covered chemical). Two minor releases of HF have occurred, and two minor releases of LPG. Four minor releases have involved a LPG/HF mixture.

Those requirements include a documented drug screening program, a comprehensive Safety Action Plan, and English fluency for employees performing safety-sensitive work.\n* Establishes pre-job meetings, pre-job safety orientation conference, and site-specific orientation before actual work begins to ensure that the contractor and contract employees fully understand the safety policies and requirements of the Memphis Refinery.\n* Assigns ultimate responsibility to contractors for their employees' safety. Such responsibility covers maintaining safe work conditions, control of unsafe acts, holding safety meetings, and accident investigation.\n* Requires periodic audits to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their responsibilities under OSHA 1910.119.\n*"

Such enforcement involves not only the contractor's responsibilities, but also Williams Refining's obligations under paragraph (h) of the PSM standard.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nWilliams Refining conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) any time new equipment or modifications to existing equipment change the process safety information pertaining to that equipment. The review is intended to verify and document that all aspects of the equipment's design, construction and operation have been evaluated, and to certify that the equipment can safely be placed in operation. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. The PSSR is the final step in the construction or installation of new or modified equipment before the equipment is placed in service. The review addresses:\n\n* Design and construction\n* Maintenance and inspection\n* Procedures\n* Training\n\nUnder most circumstances, the lead engineer on the project is responsible for arranging and facilitating the PSSR, although any employee involved with the project may conduct the review. Participation in the PSSR depends upon the extent and complexity of the project. For large projects, process units for example, the PSSR team is composed of representatives from all involved departments. For small projects, such as the replacement of noncritical valves or pumps, an individual may conduct and document the review.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n1910.119 (j) requires that employers must take specific measures to maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment.  These measures include written maintenance procedures, training in maintenance a"

RMP Submit would not allow a value of less than one pound to be entered, so one pound was used to represent values of less than one pound.\n\nRelease scenario results were estimated using the RMPlanner software published by JBF Associates (now owned by ABS Group). The software calculates estimated distances to endpoint based on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lookup Tables."

The Memphis Refinery's mechanical integrity program accomplishes the following:\n\n* Establishes responsibility for various aspects of the mechanical integrity program, divided among three groups - mechanical, instrumentation/controls, and inspection.\n* Requires procedures for the management of each of the three mechanical integrity groups. The procedures must include a description of the group organization, standards for the development of procedures, a description of quality assurance measures, a written description of employee and contract employee training, a description of document controls, and requirements for periodic compliance audits.\n* Sets general operation and maintenance training requirements for maintenance employees.\n* Sets guidelines for the conduct and documentation of process equipment inspection and testing.\n* Requires safe and timely correction of equipment deficiencies.\n* Assures integrity and quality in the suitability, installation, and maintenance of equipment.\n\nThe Maintenance and Engineering Departments are responsible for the administration of the mechanical integrity program of the Memphis Refinery. Responsibility for specific aspects of mechanical integrity rests with the appropriate group - mechanical, instrument/controls, or inspection.\n\nIn addition, the Maintenance Planning Group administers the maintenance work order system. Work is performed under the supervision of a maintenance craft foreman. Operations and Safety Department personnel provide support to ensure that work is carried out safely.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials prior to opening process piping or equipment, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training, help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nThe PSM database offers access to refinery Safe Work Practices and Refinery Safety Policies and Procedures. Both volumes were developed by the Safety and PSM Department in response to regulatory requirements and specific needs within the refinery.\n\nThe Safety and PSM Department assumes overall responsibility for the development and enforcement of Refinery Safe Work Practices and Safety Policies and Procedures. Front line enforcement of safe work practices is the responsibility of the area supervisors and craft foremen. Williams Refining expects each employee to exercise an appropriate degree of responsibility for his or her own safety, as well as the safety of his or her coworkers.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nAny modification made in the refinery that necessitates a change in existing process safety information must go through a documented process of verification. The management of change (MOC) process is a system of checks and balances intended to ensure that each department involved in the planning, installation, and operation of the modified process has reviewed and approved the change. The process also ensures that all affected process safety information is updated to reflect the change, and that the safety of the modification has been evaluated before startup.\n\nThe management of c"

If the modification is a major upgrade to a process unit, a HAZOP study may be initiated. At this point, members of the HAZOP team may make recommendations to modify the original design or to correct safety concerns. Upon completion of the project, a pre-startup safety review is conducted. When all requirements have been met and all recommendations have been resolved, the new or modified equipment may be placed in service.\n\nAny employee may initiate the MOC process. Typically, the project or process engineer overseeing the change is responsible for verifying completion of the MOC process. Managers over the Operations, Engineering, Maintenance, and PSM departments must document their approval of the change by signing the MOC form. The Safety and PSM Department has ultimate responsibility for verifying that work has been completed, the appropriate approval has been granted, all process safety information has been updated, and that all required documentation is completed, thus closing out the MOC process.\n\nIncident Investigation and Event Notices\n\n29 CFR 1910.119(m) requires investigation of any incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals in the workplace.
