Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nWe at Townsends, Inc., Pittsboro facility are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry Processing.  We have one (1) regulated \nsubstance present at our facility.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia.  The regulated substance at this facility has a singular use: refrigeration.   \n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps  \n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NEPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The ammonia refrigeration process at this facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nTownsends, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and cont"
