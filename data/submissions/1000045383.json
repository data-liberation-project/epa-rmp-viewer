Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nLord Corporation operates a Saegertown Operation manufacturing facility in Saegertown, PA.  \r\nBy policy, Lord Corporation is committed \"to operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects\r\nthe environment and the safety and health of our employees and the public\".  In pursuit of our corporate \r\npolicy, the Saegertown manufacturing facility has evaluated every Risk Management Planning listed \r\nchemical onsite and developed individualized risk reduction plans as follows:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Bromine - improved passive mitigation to prevent offsite consequences.\r\nA\u00b7 Chlorine - reduced onsite storage below threshold quantity so that only general duty\r\n compliance is required.  Chlorine detection and alarm system is in operation.\r\nA\u00b7 Toluene Diisocyanate - converted from bulk storage tank to drum storage so that no reasonable release \r\nscenario exceeds threshold quantity so that only general duty compliance is required.\r\nA\u00b7 Hydrochloric Acid - uses from purchase through disposal do not exceed the compliance \r\nconcentration of 37 percent.   \r\n\r\nOur commitment to protect our employees and the public from accidental releases includes safety\r\nreviews, alarms, emergency training, active mitigation, and passive mitigation.  Both plant and corporate \r\nemergency teams are available to respond to an emergency release.  Equipment available to team \r\nmembers includes cell phones, hand held radios and laptop computers.  Personal protective equipment available \r\nincludes chemical resistant suits and supplied air respirators. \r\n\r\nAccess to the site is restricted (24 hour site security) to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  Bromine is the only substance handled at this facility that exceeds the threshold quantities of covered substances regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule. The maximum amount of bromine that can be stored at this facility is 52,000 lbs. (26,000 pounds"

The same properties that make bromine valuable as a reactant at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling bromine to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle bromine combined with (1) the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures that we use, and (3) the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the requirements in OSHA's Employee Emergency \r\nPlans (29 CFR 1910.38) and Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation \r\n(29 CFR 1910.120). The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders, County and State agencies and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\nAn up-to date Off-Site Emergency Response Plan for Lord Corporation - Saegertown, PA Operations is \r\nmaintained with the Crawford County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) Director and is an integral \r\npart of the Environmental Emergency Response Plans for the Lord Saegertown Operations (which is also \r\nmaintained by the Crawford county OEM, PADEP-Meadville Office, and the Saegertown Volunteer Fire \r\nDepartment).\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plans have been reviewed and coordinated with the Crawford County \r\nOEM and the Saegertown VFD.  \r\nThe above agencies tour our facility periodically, typically annually, and are familiar with our \r\noperations.

The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nLord Saegertown Operation is an operating unit of the Lord Corporation headquartered in Cary, North Carolina.  Lord Saegertown produces chemical specialties commercially defined as adhesives and coatings, plus several rubber chemicals.  The products we manufacture are essentially mixtures comprised of solvents, water, chemical intermediates, and other chemical materials.  \r\nThese products are used by heavy industry to bond rubber elastomers to metal supports and frames to produce automobile engine mounts, transmission seals, energy absorbing bumper subassemblies and other applications including shock and vibration control uses.  We also manufacture industrial adhesives which are used by industry in the manufacture of laminated roll goods and structural adhesives for many manufacturing oriented applications.  Additionally, Lord Saegertown manufactures a line of urethane coatings which provide corrosion resistant painted surfaces for heavy industrial use.\r\n\r\nBromine is one of the reactants required to manufacture two intermediate products which are eventually \r\nblended with other materials to produce several of our products.  \r\nThe processes covered by this RMP include Brominated Intermediate #1 Manufacturing and \r\nBrominated Intermediate #2 Manufacturing.  \r\n\r\nBrominated Intermediate #1 and #2 Manufacturing Processes\r\nThe Saegertown plant has handled bromine safely for more than 30 years.  A detailed \r\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA), covering all known equipment and processes associated with bromine handling, was initially  conducted in 1992.  The PHA programs for these processes are reviewed every three years and the management of these processes is on-going.  \r\n\r\nThe processes use glass lined steel reactor vessels which are jacketed to enable cooling and heating via circulated jacket water.

These trucks are Department of Transportation (DOT) approved for transportation of bromine.  Bromine is unloaded into a 1000 gallon lead lined steel bulk storage tank using nitrogen pressure off-loading.  Bromine is stored in an indoor storage tank.  All bromine bulk storage is located within concrete diked areas that are enclosed and continuously monitored for bromine vapors (continuous air monitoring systems are in place for the bulk storage and processing area.  The storage facility is equipped with a water deluge system and ammonia gas delivery system to neutralize vapors.  The concrete containment dikes maintain a layer of water (or water blanket) which, should a release of bromine enter the dike, the water will suppress any bromine vapors thus providing passive mitigation.  The bromine handling system (bulk tank, receiver and reactor) is vented to a scrubber to prevent atmospheric discharges.  Water fog nozzles are located at the tank truck unloading containment area for additional active mitigation and suppression of vapors.\r\n \r\nLiquid bromine is transferred from the 1000 gallon bulk storage tank by nitrogen pressurization into receiver vessels.  The bromine is mixed with other reactants in the reactor to produce a processing intermediate.  In case of overpressurization, the receivers are vented to concrete dike areas where \r\ncontainment and passive mitigation control (water blanketing) are present.  The liquid bromine is then transferred from the receiver vessel to a reactor by gravity through approved piping.  The reactor is equipped with pressure relief venting.  Pressure is preceded by alarms.
