This regulation is published in 40 CFR Part 68. We have assessed and continue to assess how accidental releases may occur,  and how the public and environment might be impacted. After reading this program, you may consider making recommendations for improvements  to the Plant Manager. Southern States Phosphate and Fertilizer Company manufactures inorganic chemicals. We use two substances that are regulated by the above Act at or above the threshold quantities; anhydrous ammonia and 25% ammonia solution. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor. The material is a skin, eye, and respiratory hazard.\nWORST-CASE AMMONIA SCENARIO_ Based on modeling, a complete failure and release of our largest container (48,000 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 1.2 miles.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE AMMONIA SCENARIO_ Based on modeling, the most probable release of 1000 pounds of material may impact the surrounding area within 0.1 miles.\nWORST-CASE AMMONIA SOLUTION SCENARIO_ Based on modeling, a complete failure and release of our largest container (90000 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 0.7 miles.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE AMMONIA SOLUTION SCENARIO_ Based on modeling, the most probable release of 1000 pounds of material may impact the surrounding area within less than 0.1 miles.\nDesigning for Safety: We receive railcars that are authorized and specified for the safe transportation of hazardous materials by the Federal Department of Transportation; Our plant design provides for automatic and manual valve closure in the event of a system failure; All process construction is accomplished by professional engineers.\nMaintenance: Maintenance personnel are trained and qualified; Critical Equipment is routine"

Plant alarm is activated; 2. Facility Emergency Coordinator is called to assess the release; 3. Savannah Fire Department HazMat Team is called and facility is evacuated if neccessary; 4. Chatham Emergency Management Agency is notified; 5. Release is controlled by the Fire Department, or plant personnel. We have had no reportable accidents in the past five years."
