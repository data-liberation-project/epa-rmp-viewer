Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during day to day operation and during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Columbia River Processing to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n  \r\nSafety at the Columbia River Processing facility is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  The design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices and the safe handling policies and procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nColumbia River Processing has a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan developed in compliance with the provisions of OAR 1910.38.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning as well as emergency response guidelines and a process for coordinating an emergency response with outside agencies.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \r\n \r\n1.20   Facility Description and Substances Handled\r\n\r\nColumbia River Processing manufactures, processes, stores, and distributes cheese.

There is also a cheese starter system that requires up to 2,000 pounds of ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.30   Worst-case release scenario and  alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView V (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\r\n\r\n1.40   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nColumbia River Processing complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

The plan is administered by the Tillamook County Creamery Association Director of Environmental and Political Affairs.\r\n \r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures and specific safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel are authorized to operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any process adjustments are performed by these qualified persons.\r\n  \r\n1.50   Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nColumbia River Processing reported a release of ammonia in July 2008.\r\n \r\n1.60   Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nColumbia River Processing has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health."
