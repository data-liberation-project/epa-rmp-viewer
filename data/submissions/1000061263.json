Lyons has identified potential process hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) refrigeration systems and has developed a program to prevent and reduce the risk that these hazards pose to employees and/or the public.  The process hazard analysis was based on an International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) hazard study customized and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that all potential hazards of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at Lyons were thoroughly identified and evaluated.  Lyons has taken care in the design, operation, and maintenance of all anhydrous ammonia containing equipment to ensure a high level of safety.  ",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nLyon Magnus East's (hereafter referred to as Lyons) policy is to fully comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  This includes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan, along with other safety and environmental programs already in place, enables Lyons to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\n\n\nLyons's emergency response program is designed to provide rapid response to suspected problems to keep hazardous materials from being released into the environment, minimize the effects of any spills and provide proper clean-up and required notifications as soon as possible following any incidents.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\n\n\nLyons is a beverage food processing facility located at 95 Richmond Road in Walton, KY 41094.  The facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112(r)) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than the 10,000 pound threshold as established in the regulations.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the food beverage products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep products fresh.  The system consists of compressors, evaporators, piping and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as either a gas or a liquid in different parts of the system.  \n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nLyons complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules fo"

All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 have been developed and implemented at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system was designed and constructed using good engineering practices.  A process hazard analysis was conducted for the ammonia system using a \"What-If Checklist\" and all identified issues are in the process of being addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  In addition, a mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia refrigeration equipment and operations.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidents involving ammonia have occurred during the last five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program \n\n\n\nLyon's Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with Boone County Emergency Management Department which is incorporated into the facility's written Emergency Action Plan.  The plan includes procedure for notification of local fire department and outside emergency response personnel as needed.\n\n"
