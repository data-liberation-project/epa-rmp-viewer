Robinson Electric Generating Station.\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nP.H. Robinson Electric Generating Station is located in Bacliff, Texas.  The facility is a 2,265-MW electric generation facility powered by four steam electric generating units.  A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is associated with each of the units.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at P.H. Robinson is comprised of storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The three tanks each have a capacity of 50,000 gallons, and each tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve, a vacuum breaker valve with flame arrestor, and liquid level indicators.  \n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed in the RMP*Comp, Version 1.07 modeling system.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, in which the entire contents of the tank are released within the secondary containment dike.  The secondary containment dike is large enough to contain the entire volume of all three tanks and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, w"

      "SummaryText": "hich reduces the release rate.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 0.7 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  This worst-case impact distance extends offsite of the P.H. Robinson facility and impacts offsite residences and small industrial areas.  The WCS does not impact any offsite institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), recreational areas, major commercial areas, or environmental receptors.\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and the ammonia supply header for the vaporizers, a failed pipe between the ammonia supply header and a vaporizer, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.3 miles) and is the ARS presented in this RMP.  The impact due to this ARS does not extend offsite of the P. H. Robinson facility and, therefore, does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), recreational areas, major commercial areas, or environmental receptors.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nA five-year accident history is not applicable, since this is a new process at the facility that has yet to commence operations.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nP.H. Robinson is covered by an accidental release prevention program, which includes the following:\n ?Periodic hazard review and updates\n ?Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n ?Emergency response plan coordinated with local responding agencies\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components:\n ?Comprehensive plan covering all components of the aqueous ammonia system with respect to operation, maintenance, inspection, and training\n ?Inter"

P.H. Robinson employees have been trained in this plan and would be the first responders in the event of an emergency. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at P.H. Robinson was conducted as part of this RMP.  This is a new process, and there are not any planned changes to the system at this time."
