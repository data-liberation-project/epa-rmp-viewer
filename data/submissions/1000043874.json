      "SummaryText": "Scott's Liquid Gold--Inc., (SLG) is a public corporation manufacturing and marketing, nationally and internationally, household chemical products in liquid and aerosol forms, namely, Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Cleaner and Preservative and a single phase air Freshener, Touch of Scent.  Fifty-seven employees work at SLG's corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility located at 4880 Havana Street, Denver, CO.  The SLG process which is subject to 40 CFR Part 58 is the receiving, storage, transfer, and pressurization of a 2Qaerosol container, utilizing an aerosol grade propellant (100% 1,1 Difluoroethane), trade name 152A.  Written operating procedures requiring daily personal and mechanical monitoring are closely followed to prevent no more than 7,000 gallons of 152A from being present in an 18000 gallon capacity, non-pressurized outside above-ground storage tank.  The tank is located in a fenced, secured area, an estimated 80' from the north wall of the facility and is video monitored 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  It is also physically inspected on a weekly basis by production and quarterly by our safety consultant. Any deficiencies \n\nare documented and followed up with immediate remedial action.  Strict Good Manufacturing Processes and state of the art active/passive detection, prevention and fire/explosion repression systems are utilized to minimize the possibility of any loss scenarios.  SLG is in compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  It is the philosophy of SLG to go beyond minimum requirements to approach compliance in a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to aid in the prevention, detection and control of loss potentials. Although SLG has not experienced any loss incidents since beginning to utilize 152A in 2004 and its predecessor 152a/A-17.8218 in 1996, response will be immediate with appropriate preventative and protection measures, after observing or otherwise learning of the most remote possibility of loss potential."
