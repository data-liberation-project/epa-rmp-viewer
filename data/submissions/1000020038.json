This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses roughly 13,000 pounds of ammonia for processing and warehouse cold storage.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condenser is mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/process areas.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the High Temperature Pump Receiver and Low Temperature Pump Receiver which pumps the liquid to the evaporators throughout the facility.  The liquid ammonia expands as it enters the various evaporator coils, reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for warehouse/dock storage.  As the air is chilled by the evaporators, the ammonia is vaporized and returned to the respective pump receivers.\n\n\n\nThe compressors pull the low pressure ammonia vapor from the pump receivers where it is compressed into a high pressure vapor.  This vapor is then piped to the condenser, where the ammonia is converted back to high pressure liquid and recycled to the High Pressure Receiver.  The auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensables collected in the HPR and the condensers.  \n\n"
