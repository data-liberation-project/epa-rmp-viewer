However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Whitetail Gas Processing Plant is located approximately 3 miles south of Kane, PA on state route 4009.  The plant processes about 7 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehyrdrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed to produce a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are removed are fractionated into a natural gasoline mixture.  Total liquid production is about 50 BPD with  storage capacity of 571 Bbls.  The plant has inlet compression, hydrate suppression, and utilizes a refrigerated process for hydrocarbon removal.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such propane, natural gasoline.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps::\nThis facility is constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\nChemical-Specific steps include:\nThe Whitetail Gas Processing Plant includes the following safety features:\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms;\n2. Process safety relief valves;\n3. Automated plant shutdown system (the plant will be automatically shutdown should key process variables vary from specified ranges);\n4. Manual valves to permit isolation of var"
