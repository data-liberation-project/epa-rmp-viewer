A Program 1 plan for both the propane refrigeration process and NGL/MI process is being submitted.\n\nDescription of  stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nCGF is located west of the Central Compression Plant (CCP) in the East Operating Area (EOA). The purpose of CGF is to increase overall field production of Greater Prudhoe Bay. Raw gas is received from the Gathering Centers and Flow Stations at approximately 550 psig and 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F. It is routed through inlet separators at both the CCP and CGF. The inlet separators remove any remaining moisture, crude products, triethylene glycol (TEG) carryover, and any other remaining contaminants. After inlet separation, all of the gas is routed through CGF where the raw gas pressure is boosted to approximately 700 psig in three Booster Compressor trains to increase the efficiency of the three Low Temperature Separation (LTS) trains that separate the heavier Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) and Miscible Injectant (MI) products from the lighter residue gas (primarily methane). The dry residue gas is compressed by the CGF Tandem Compressors and the CCP compressors to be reinjected into the gas cap while the heavier NGL and MI products are further processed in the Stabilization System. The Stabilizer uses a fractional distillation process to separate the valuable NGLs from the MI gas. The NGLs are shipped to the pipeline and the MI gas is compressed for injection into the oil bearing formation to enhance the oil production. \n\nDuring peak years of production at Prudhoe Bay, CGF processed up to 9.3 Bscfd of gas, producing up to 101,000 bpd of NGL product and up to 612 MMscfd of MI product. Current production rates (as of 2012) are well below those peak values, but typically are in the range of approximately 7.5 Bscfd of gas, 55,000 bpd of NGL and 235 MMscfd of MI product.\n\nPropane Refrigeration and Manufacturing Sy"
