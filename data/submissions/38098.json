The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is beingfiled as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  As required by California Accidental Release Preventon Program (CalARP ) Regulations, this RMP is also being filed with the local Administering Agency, Butte County Public Health Department, Division of Environmental Health.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nParadise Irrigation District's Water Treatment Plant is located at 13888 Pine Needle Drive, Magalia, CA in Butte County, and uses chlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located at the outlet of the Magalia Reservoir near the communities of Magalia and Paradise Pines.  There are 7 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and trunnion sets inside the buil"

      "SummaryText": "ding.  The chlorine is used to control biological growth on the filters and to disinfect the treated water.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Paradise Irrigation District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Paradise Irrigation District has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Paradise Irrigation District are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nParadise Irrigation District has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Paradise Irrigation District's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PS"

These include, among other things, revision of facility-specific written operation procedures and installing seismic restraints for the ton containers and container scales.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nParadise Irrigation District's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Butte County Public Health Department, Division of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies, notifying Califonia Office of Emergency Services at (800) 852-7570 and the National Response Center at (800) 424-8802 in case of the release or threatened release of Reportable Quantities (10 lb. or more) of chlorine, and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas upwind of the released gas.  First Responders have participated with Paradise Irrigation District personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Paradise Irrigation District committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
