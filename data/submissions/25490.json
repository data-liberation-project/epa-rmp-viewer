Duda & Sons, Inc. has a Hazard Communications Program in place implemented through the Duda Safety Department.  This program covers:  material inventory, material safety data sheets (MSDS), training, labels and warnings, responsibilities, recordkeeping, proper and safe handling procedures, personal protective equipment, emergency equipment, first aid procedures, emergency response procedures, along with employee responsibilities.\n\n\n\n(b)    The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n\n\nIn an effort to comply with Sec. 68.165 Offsite Consequence Analysis, a Hazard Assessment of the regulated toxic substance(s) on site at the Duda - Belle Glade facility was conducted.  The only regulated toxic substance on site is AMMONIA (anhydrous).  \n\n\n\n(c)    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario;\n\n\n\nResults of the Consequence Analysis performed RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07 (EPA website): \n\n\n\nRMP*Comp Ver. 1.07\n\nResults of Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nChemical: Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\nCAS #: 7664-41-7\n\nCategory: Toxic Gas\n\nScenario: Worst-case\n\nQuantity Released: 8925 pounds\n\nRelease Duration: 10 min\n\nRelease Rate: 491 pounds per min\n\nMitigation Measures: Release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air\n\n\n\nTopography: Rural surroundings (terrain generally flat and unobstructed)\n\nToxic Endpoint: 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\n\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 1.2 miles (1.9 kilometers)\n\n\n\n--------Assumptions About This Scenario---------\n\nWind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour)\n\nStability Class: F\n\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNo alternative release scenario(s) were n"

Administrative/Mitigation measures are in place as there are no public and/or environmental receptors within the estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 1.2 miles (1.9 kilometers).  Location of substance is approximately 5 miles from public road access.   The regulated substance is located within the confines of the packinghouse (some areas are open-walled).

It is the responsibility of the Emergency Response Person to notify the Corporate Offices within five (5) minutes in order for Corporate to notify the appropriate agencies within fifteen (15) minutes.\n\n3.    Secure the spill and affected areas from accidental entry and disconnect ignition sources at the main panel.\n\n4.    Begin first aid treatment to exposed personnel (only if you are properly trained in first aid).  Refer to labels and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for first aid procedures.\n\n5.    Assist your supervisor and the authorities if your help is summoned.\n\n6.    DO NOT reenter evacuated areas until they a"
