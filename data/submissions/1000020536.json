Over the past years. HCWD#1 has spent $20,000 for a building to store and confine 2,000 lb(4total) chlorine cyclinders to minimize escaping cl2 gas,a cl2 gas detector was installed to instantly set off alarms if a cl2 leak is detected over 3 ppm ( parts per million) so HCWD#1 could take immediate action to notify surrounding residences, police, medical personnel, fire department, and local government agencies.

Reviewing chlorine handling safety video's, periodically reviewing sop's. Emergency responce procedures at our facility is as follows.\n1.   Verify leak visually with ammmonia or smell(assuming there is no obvious visible plume.                                                            \n\n2. Notify the facility Emergency Response Coordinator or the alternate of the potential problem.\n\n3. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (ppe).If it's a controlled small leak and plant personel can't stop the leak by closing the main valve they are to notify JONES CHEMICAL of the situation so they can dispatch thier emergency response team/tank repair personel.                                                                        \n\n\n4.
