The plant, located in the Rangely Weber Sand Unit field, is approximately three miles west of the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas.  Chevron has five (5) employees assigned to the Plant.\r\n\r\nThe primary activities of the   Plant involving RMP regulated substances are recovering a casing head natural gas product by chilling a gas stream.  A distillation process is used to purify the product that condenses as a result of chilling the stream.  The refrigeration system re-circulates a refrigerant to remove heat from the stream being processed.  The extraction process and the refrigeration process is a Program Level 1.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Chevron USA Production Company to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environment.  The RWSU Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident; developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks; communicating relevant information to employees, contractors and appropriate agencies; and conducting emergency exercises. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nChevron encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participate as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the RWSU accident prevention program element. \r\n\r\nThe RWSU plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key p"

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \r\n\r\nFor The extraction process and the propane refrigeration process, Chevron has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, level, flow,) in the plant instrumentation systems, point detail directory.  Chevron ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems)\r\n\r\nThe RWSU plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe RWSU plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal shutdown, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.

There have been no releases from the RMP Covered processes in the last five years. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe RWSU plant maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The Emergency Action Plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the"
