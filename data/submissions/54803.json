It is DAI Oildale, Inc.'s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations. Further, it is DAI Oildale, Inc.'s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nDAI Oildale, Inc. emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs. In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, hazardous materials handling, safe work methods, and safe use of equipment. Additionally, emergency response procedures have been established by DAI Oildale, Inc.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DAI Oildale, Inc. cogeneration facility is owned and operated by DAI Management Consultants, Inc. The plant, which is located in the Kern River Oil Field, northeast of Bakersfield, California, began commercial operation in the spring of 1990.\n\nCogeneration, in the case of the DAI Oildale, Inc. facility, is the simultaneous production of thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel source. Combustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically coupled to an electric generator. Waste heat from the gas turbine's exhaust flows into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The HRSG extracts the heat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil recovery. Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator coupled to the combustion turbine.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the DAI Oildale, Inc. facility to create a reducing atmosphere in the SCR process. This reducing atmosphere in the flue gas helps convert nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water as it passes through the cata"

The operation of the SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the gas turbine.\n\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 12,417 gallon (water capacity) storage tank. The maximum intended inventory of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is based on the American National Standard Institute's K61.1 safety requirements and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in Section 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR). These standards and regulations limit the maximum ammonia storage capacity of the tank to approximately 57,900 pounds.\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/I (200 ppm).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at DAI Oildale, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia system. The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n?  Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n?  An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and has been updated and revalidated.\n\n?  Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n?  Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n?  Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n?  Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n?  A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed ch"

Pre-startup safety reviews are performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n?  Audits are conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n?  Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n?  A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n?  Hot work permits are issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system.\n\n?  A Contractor Safety Policy has been developed and implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented, DAI Oildale, Inc. has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Plant Manager. The Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDAI Oildale, Inc. has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based SCR system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDAI Oildale, Inc. has established emergency procedures and mechanisms to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since DAI Oildale, Inc. employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, DAI Oildale, Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.
