      "SummaryText": "At this new Alton facility, Illinois-American Water Company handles chlorine for the purpose of disinfecting and treating drinking water. OSHA and EPA consider chlorine a hazardous chemical. The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is Illinois-American Water Company policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner that covered process chemicals are handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency action plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans) 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) and experience obtained from community drills.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Alton facility is 32,000 pounds.\nAmmonia is used at the Alton facility but, is in a quantity below the threshold quantity limit. The maximum amount of ammonia stored at the Alton facility is 8550 pounds.\n\nThe chlorine is delivered by truck in one-ton cylinders. Chlorine is added to water as  gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flowstream of water at the point of application.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is delivered by truck in one-ton cylinders. Ammonia is added to water as gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flowstream of water at the point of application.\n\nSenior management is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and its impact on the surrounding communities.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nChl"

      "SummaryText": "orine - Greenish yellow gas with a pungent irritating odor. Chlorine is liquified under pressure, but is used as a gas at ambient  temperature. Illinois-American Water Company uses chlorine for water disinfection.\nWorst Case Scenario - Catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact or construction defects. 2000lb release in 10 minutes. Distance to endpoint is 0.9 miles.\nAlternative Case Scenario - Tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16 inch valve body opening. 317lbs released in 60 minutes. Distance to endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nProper design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine feed system should significantly decrease the likelihood of an accidental release of chlorine. \n\n3.1 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Wallace Tiernan Manuals, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations. A chlorine scrubber is utilized at this facility to neutralize the contents of a one ton container and prevent a release to atmosphere.\n\n3.2 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past 5 years.\n\n3.3 THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe written emergency response program as mentioned in the opening paragraph is located at the facility with an on-going training program. Fire department inspections/tours are conducted annually, identifying on-site chemicals, storage locations, chemical hazards, special instructions and requirements. Drills at this facility are coordinated with the local fire department. Public notification will be handled through the local fire department per the emergency action plan.\n\n3.4 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAlthough there are no immediate plans for changes to improve safety at this facility, we constantly review advancement in safety and pro"
