This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant is located at 17005 State Route 7, P.O. Box 446, Marietta, Ohio.  Various chemicals are processed to produce engineering polymers which are used in medical, electronic, automotive, and food service application.  The regulated substance at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity is methyl chloride.\n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for methyl chloride, a toxic gas liquefied by pressure, is a gaseous release of 26,650 pounds of pure methyl chloride in ten minutes (2670 lbs. /min).  The WCS is the loss of the entire contents of the larger of two methyl chloride storage tanks (C-151) and is based on an endpoint concentration identified by emergency response planning guide level 2 (ERPG-2) with a value of 0.82 mg/L.  The distance to end point (1.1 miles) was calculated for the WCS using the methodology outline in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance using the RMP*Comp online tool.

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant primarily uses the hazard and operability with Layers of Protection Analysis (HAZOP/LOPA) techniques to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe HAZOP team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Solvay plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.

      "SummaryText": "olvay plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Solvay plant is coordinated with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Solvay plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Solvay plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant has identified the following planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\n1.  Ongoing participation by plant employees in programs designed to enhance safety awareness and positive behaviors.\n\n2.  Plant emergency response plan training and drills.\n\n3.  Review and where appropriate revise process instrumentation and/or controls.\n\n4.  Review or revise personnel training programs.\n\n5.  Review or revise written operating procedures."
