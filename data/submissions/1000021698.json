The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n  Tom Thumb's safety Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Tom Thumb was completed in February 2001. The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods. The facility is located at 743 Henrietta Creek Road in Roanoke, Texas about 0.5 miles west of Route 377 and 0.5 miles north of Route 170. The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with other warehouse storage facilities.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 27,532 pounds of ammonia for various freezer and storage areas. The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condenser is mounted outside on a platform, along with the High pressure receiver below it, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas or roof-top penthouses.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammo"

The thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid ammonia for oil cooling to the six compressors (C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, and C6).  The High Pressure Liquid Receiver distributes high pressure liquid to the High Pressure Recirculator.\nThe High pressure recirculator pumps liquid ammonia to the Glycol Chiller (HE-1)LPR 1 and the following evaporators:  Shipping Dock Evaporators (D-EV-1 - D-EV-9), 55A?F Produce Evaporators (EV-1 & EV-2), 34A?F Wet Produce Evaporators (EV-3 & EV-4), 34A?F Dry Produce Evaporators (EV-5 & EV-6),  30A?F Packaged Meat Evaporator (EV-7 & EV-8), 34A?F Dairy/Deli Evaporators (EV-9 - EV-16). The High Pressure recirculator also feeds liquid to the Low Pressure recirculator (LPR-1).  The Low Pressure Recirculator (LPR-1) pumps liquid ammonia to the freezer evaporators (EV-17 - EV-22) located in the large and small freezer, and the ice cream freezer.  There is a surge drum associated with each ice cream evaporator(2) that maintains a constant liquid level for cooling.  As heat is absorbed, the ammonia is partially vaporized before it is drawn back to its respective recirculator.  \n\nVapor from the LPR-1 is pulled through  Compressor 2 (C-2), while vapor from the Low Temperature Accumulator  (LTA-1) is pulled by Compressor 1 (C-1).  Both C-1 & C-2 discharge to the HPR-1.  Compressor 3 (C-3) is a swing compressor which draws suction from HPR-1, but is also plumbed to pull from the LPR-1 and/or LTA-1.  C-3 discharges to the condenser, but is also plumbed to discharge back to the HPR-1.  Compressors 4, 5, & 6 draw suction from HPR-1 and discharge to the condenser.  The condenser converts compressor discharge (hot gas) into high pressure liquid and recycles it to the Thermosyphon Receiver. Compressor discharge is also routed to the evapoators for hot gas defrost. \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Tom Thumb ammonia refrigeration s"

For example, the Tom Thumb facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\nThe Tom Thumb facility including each ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the penthouses and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  There are no ammonia-related accidents at the facility to report.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nContinued training and education of employees and continous improvement on operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n"
