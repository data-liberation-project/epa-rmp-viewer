Also, as the operator of a facility at which substances may be used that in uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) is one of these programs.\n     Each employee in areas where the RMP is applicable will be knowledgeable of the related policies and procedures and the supervisors or a designated person is required to insure that they understand them.  Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation.\n    A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Release Prevention Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.  A compilation of safety information to enable Wabash Alloys and the employees involved in the chlorine operations to operate safety has been accumulated.  This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed.  This plan of action includes information pertaining to the technology of the processes, and information pertaining to any equipment used in the processes.\n     A complete hazard analysis and study of the chlorine systems' mechanical integrity has been completed on the chlorine receipt, storage, and utilization operations have been completed.

As a manufacturer of aluminum ingots its products are sold globally under its corporate company, Connell, LLC, 1 International Place, Fort Hill Square, Boston Massachusetts.\n    The Wabash Alloys site is approximately 30 acres in size, and is located in a predominantly industrial area of Dickson.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  \n    The surrounding vicinity consists generally of industrial and manufacturing structures.  The property is bordered on the west by railroad tracks and residences; to the east by residences; to the north by Printwood Drive and across the street by Tedsik Aluminum, and to the south by wooded areas.\n    The western, active portion of the site is mostly occupied by scrap metal piles, loading docks, and a railroad spur.  Two 55-ton rail tanker cars containing chlorine is also on the West Side.  One of these cars is connected to the Wabash facility at a time.  Access to the property is to the north side as well as employee parking.  The entire site is fenced.\n    The site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n    The sorted aluminum is charged into one of four furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-"

Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n    Once the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles for shipment as a molten material.  Particulate emissions from the crusher are controlled with a baghouse.  The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.  Emissions from melters, ingot and sow molding processes, and dross cooling operations are controlled using a baghouse.\n    Chlorine is received at the facility in 55-ton rail cars.  The tanker is connected into piping through which chlorine as liquid flows to a vaporizer at a pressure of 150 psi. \n     The vaporizer heats the chlorine to the vapor state by a recirculated hot water electric heater, which is thermostatically controlled.  Chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through a regulator and into a piping manifold to furnaces.  Each furnace has its own chlorine supply pipe and flowmeter, which regulates the pressure.\n     At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Here the chlorine reacts with magnesium and aluminum to demag and clean the aluminum alloy.\nGeography and Weather:\n     The city of Dickson is located in middle Tennessee approximately 40 miles west of Nashville and 160 miles east of Memphis.

The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas, that can be exposed to an accidental release.\n    One worst case scenario for chlorine was decided upon as the complete rapid loss of a 55 tons from the tanker car during a one-minute time frame.  The only likely causes for such an incident is felt to be from a natural disaster or a derailment of the tanker car.\n    The worst case scenario for chlorine was decided as the complete rapid loss of 55 tons of chlorine during a one-minute time frame. The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F, 4.5 mph wind speed, and a toxic vapor level of 3ppm for chlorine.  This resulted in a release rate of 110,000 lbs/min, and an end point of 24.05 miles from the spill point during summer season at 90 degrees F and 22.84 miles from the spill point during winter season at 40 degrees F.  \n    As an alternative case scenario it was decided that the possibility would include damage to a 1\" pipe, probably at the connection station where the facility is connected to the chlorine tanker car.
