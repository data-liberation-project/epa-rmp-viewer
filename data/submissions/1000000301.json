Regular audits are conducted to ensure that these programs are in place and functioning well at the Martinez Plant.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Martinez Plant utilizes a regeneration process to manufacture various strengths and grades of sulfuric acid. Its acid is used in the gasoline manufacturing process at refineries, metals mining, processing pulp and paper, agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and water treatment. The only chemical stored and used in the Martinez Plant that is covered by the EPA RMP regulation is anhydrous ammonia (NH3). The Plant uses anhydrous ammonia at its abatement tower to control sulfur dioxide emissions. This process generates ammonium bisulfite as a by-product fertilizer that is sold seasonally. \r\n\r\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst-case and alternate release scenarios for this RMP update and re-submittal, Solvay used the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, and the Census Bureau's Landview V software for estimating population, with Marplot for mapping.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) for ammonia stored on site is the release of the total contents of the storage tank of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) over a 10-minute period. No credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.  \r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario\r\n\r\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for ammonia stored on site was selected from the results of the process hazard assessments that were completed for the ammonia storage unit. The ARS associated with the release of ammonia at the Martinez Plant is a leak in the hose during the unloading of an ammonia tank truck.\r\n\r\n4.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Solvay Martinez Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What-Ifs and  HazOps using LOPA and What-If Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a cross-functional team of qualified personnel with expertise in risk analysis, engineering, process operations, and maintenance.  All process hazard analyses are revalidated every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, the Solvay Martinez Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  All operating procedures are reviewed and recertified annually.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe Solvay Martinez Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure all operations personnel are competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Solvay Martinez Plant carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices and the potential hazards associated with each unit.  Furthermore, specialized training is offered as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  This is tracked through the company-intranet-based work order system.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at the Solvay Martinez Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  All changes are reviewed for potential health, safety, or environmental concerns.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change and training is provided on the modification.  All relevant documentation and drawings are updated as part of the action items resulting from the changes.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Solvay Martinez Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operation and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also performed for any process that has been idle for longer than six months.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Solvay Martinez Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years.  The plant's personnel are responsible for developing an action plan to address all recommendations resulting from audits in a timely manner."
