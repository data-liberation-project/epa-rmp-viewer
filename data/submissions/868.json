              "Description": "The Prevention Program for the Auburn Water Treatment Plant addresses one covered process  (Chlorine).  The following is a brief narrative of the programs in place at the facility.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) includes Prevention Programs for Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  Safety Information includes  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower parameters, and equipment specifications, and standards used to design, build and operate the process.  The Hazard Analysis Program includes identified hazards associated with the regulated substances, possible oppportunities for equipment malfunction or human error, and steps to detect or monitor releases.  The Operating Procedures Program includes procedures currently utilized by the plant for;  initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and start-up following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change.  Included in these procedures are consequences of deviation, steps to avoid, and equipment inspections.  Training of all employees at the plant is strictly enforced.  All employees must complete an annual chlorine safety course instructed by a qualified instructor and all plant operators must have at least Grade III Water Plant Certification before hire.  These training records are kept in the employee files.  The Maintenance Program includes a written list of preventative maintenance procedures to help ensure safe working conditions.  These procedures include inspection and testing of equpiment, general good engineering and housekeeping procedures, and manufacturer's recommended procedures.  All employees receive on the job training in these areas.  Although, the Auburn Water Treatment Facility has not had any incidents, an Incident Investigation Program is in place.  This program includes prompt investigation of any incident, a written repor, review and correction of the report findings, and communication with employees regarding the incident.  A compliance audit was completed in conjunction with the RMP.  The Compliance Audit Program states that an audit must be completed at least every three years and the audit reports must be kept on file.  The audit report must also include findings and actions taken by the plant to correct deficiencies.",

      "SummaryText": "The Auburn Water Treatment Plant is owned and operated by the City of Auburn Water Works Board.  The facility is located at 1385 Binford Drive in Auburn, Alabama.  The parcel is described as being in the northeast 1/4  of Section 5, Township 18 N, Range 26 E.  The subject site consists of approxiamately 13 acres, bounded by residential property to the west, south and east.  The Auburn 7.5  Minute Quadrangle Topographic Map, USGS 1983, shows the elevation at the site to be approxiamately 600 feet above sea level.  The surface water flow is in a southerly direction towards a tributary of Lake Wilmore.\n\nThe facility treats water obtained from Lake Ogletree for use a potable water for the City of Auburn, Alabama.  During treatment process the facility utilizes chlorine gas for bacterial control.  The chlorine gas process is isolated to reduce the probability of an incident and the operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the one ton cylinders containing the chlorine.\n\nA review of the process indicated that the worst case scenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being placed into service.  The release would allow gaseous chlorine to migrate off plant site to the south-southeast, along a natural drainage fall-line toward a residential area.  The envelope of exposure will be some 1.1 miles.  The most likely, alternative, scenario is the release of a partially fill cylinder, containing less than 2000 pounds, with the same flow pattern and travelling .42 miles.  In both cases the emergency response involves the activation of the local Emergency Response Program and the potential evacuation of residents.\n\nThe site has a prevention program in place that addresses the following program elements:  Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training (maintenance, operators and emergency action), Maintenance, Incident Investigation and Compliance Auditing.  These programs are utilized for the entire operation and for the specific chemical, chlorine.  The efforts "

However, should an incidnet occur, the site has developed an Emergency Response Program that involves the local Public Safety Department (fire and police), the local HAZMAT team and other support agencies.\n\nIn the future, the already successful programs will be maintained to assure continued protections of the local population and environment.  Additionally, due to projected growth to the area, consideration is being given to relocation of the facility, at which time (10-20 years), all new technologies will be evaluated to reduce the potential for a release."
