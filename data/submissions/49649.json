Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  \nHuntsman Marysville is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Marysville Site's 15-1/2 year \"0\" accidental release history.   The Huntsman Marysville site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Marysville participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since first producing quality polypropylene resin for automotive and other industries in October 1988, the Marysville Site has remained both a safe and quality supplier for over 15 years in Eastern Michigan as exemplified by our June 1996 certification to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management process, a September 1998 Automotive Industry's QS-9000 quality management system certification, and most recently, a successful State Process Safety Management inspection during January 2003 which resulted in compliments to the site for operating a comprehensive program.\n\nHuntsman's Marysville site is located in the southwestern corner of the City of Marysville, Michigan.  The site includes 58.6 acres, of which 20 acres have been developed.  The Marysville Site utilizes a continuous polymerization operation to convert pipeline-supplied propylene and ethylene into polypropylene pellets which molding companies then process into useful applications such as:  automotive trim, toys, medical containers, appliance parts, and other consumer products.  Propane is produced as a by-product of propylene purification.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances.\nHuntsman's Marysville Site has 2 regulated substanc"

Offsite Consequence Analysis.\nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA section of this Risk Management Plan includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \n\nHuntsman Marysville used LandView 5, software supplied by the USEPA et al., to estimate the residential population within the distance to endpoint for both the Worst Case Release and Alternative Case Release Scenarios.  Huntsman Marysville also used knowledge of the surrounding area in estimating affected populations. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Marysville Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  \n\n? Process Safety Information\n Huntsman's Marysville Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\n? Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n?

Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n \n? Process Hazard Analysis\n Huntsman's Marysville Site has performed process hazard analyses (PHA) on the polypropylene process to identify any potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls, and ways to minimize those hazards.  The Marysville Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating process hazards.  The Marysville Site assigns employees to the PHA team who are knowledgeable in the PHA methodology and the specific process.  The PHA team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n \n? Operating Procedures\n Huntsman Marysville maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures, and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n? Training\n Huntsman Marysville provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n \n?
