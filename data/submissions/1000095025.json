No additional measures are necessary to prevent off site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of propane gas from the tanks, entry within the distance to the endpoint may pose a danger to the facility and public emergency responders.  Therefore, public responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the Emergency Contact(s) indicated in this Risk Management Plan.  \n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________    ________________________________\n\nSignature                    Printed Name\n\n\n\n______________________________________    ________________________________\n\nTitle                         Date\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  Intertractor America Corporation complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) - 58 requirements for LP-Gas storage and it is its policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.
