This Executive Summary describes the processes that are used at this facility and the precautions that are taken to prevent the escape or release of noxious materials.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Spotswood mill occupies the area between Main Street and Duhernal Lake, in Spotswood, New Jersey, and consists of 22 buildings, including administrative offices, processing buildings, and warehouses.  One of the processes (bleaching) involves a regulated chemical - chlorine.  Although this chemical is toxic and an oxidizer, special procedures and controls are used in its handling and processing.  As a result, there have been no serious incidents involving chlorine in the past five years.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nOperations involving chlorine at the Spotswood mill are regulated by the Process Safety Management standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and by the Accidental Release Prevention regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency.  To comply with these standards, the Spotswood mill follows strict guidelines for operating procedures, training of employees, analysis of processes for potential hazards, preventive maintenance programs, emergency plans, and investigation of incidents, with employee participation in this process safety effort.  In addition, the Spotswood mill has been involved in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJTCPA) program since 1990, with annual reviews of the chlorine processes and with multiple safety audits by outside consultants since that date.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAs par"

      "SummaryText": "t of the NJTCPA program, the Spotswood mill has conducted at least one emergency response drill every year since 1990.  These drills involved the Spotswood Police Department and the Spotswood Fire Department (which comprises the Local Emergency Planning Committee), as well as employees who are trained to recognize and respond to simulated emergency situations and to activate shutdown and other protective systems.  Annual tours are arranged for members of the Fire Department to show them the locations of the chlorine unloading facilities and fire protection systems.  A weather station is maintained on site to provide information to local authorities regarding the protection of occupants of residences and business establishments in the downwind direction, if necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSchweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Spotswood mill.  Although no specific changes are currently planned, specific policies aimed at improving safety will be continually improved.  These policies include: continuing development of best management practices; conducting site- and job-specific training; continuing coordination with the fire department; and upholding the facility?s goal for a safe workplace."
