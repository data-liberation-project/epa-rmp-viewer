This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Samson policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nThe LaBokay 11 #1 Facility conditions the raw natural gas stream to make it suitable for sales. After bulk liquid separation, water is removed from the gas stream by means of glycol dehydration. Following glycol dehydration the gas stream is sent to a refrigeration skid to recover Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Any liquids that are removed from the natural gas stream through bulk separation are sent to a heater treater for three phase separation prior to being sent to atmospheric storage tanks. Liquids from the refrigeration plant are sent to a stabilizer tower.  Liquids from the stabilizer tower go to the NGLs storage tank and are later transported offsite via tanker trucks. Gas leaving the refrigeration unit goes to pipeline. Any gases generated by the stabilization of natural gas liquids at the facility are compressed and re-circulated to the inlet of the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe LaBokay 11 #1 Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, all equipment and vessels can be considered as part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantity of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nSamson identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulat"

However, since Samson employees will respond, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained in this RMP.  These procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. Copies of this facility Emergency Response Plan are kept with operating personnel, at the local field office, Samson Intranet site and the corporate office.

Emergency response activities are also coordinated with the local fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSamson is committed to operating the LaBokay 11 #1 Facility in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment. Samson personnel have an opportunity to make suggestions that could improve the safety of the facility during regional safety meetings. Samson will also conduct compliance audits and hazard reviews as required and make improvements to safety, based on findings of the audits and reviews.\n\n\n\n"
