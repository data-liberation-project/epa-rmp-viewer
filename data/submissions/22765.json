If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Larry Wickman who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Larry will then decide what steps to be taken in the event of an emergency.   Our facility here in Mallard is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is 137,700pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 13,770  pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.   According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoints is 4.4 miles.  Mallard has 3 bullet tanks and 33 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  There are an estimated 523 people within this radius.  Within the radius are schools, residences, recreation areas, and major commercial, office and industrial areas.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator Company holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  The anhydrous ammonia plants was designed, installed, and is maintained state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Mallard Fire Dept and request tha"
