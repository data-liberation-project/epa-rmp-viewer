Facility Policy\n\n\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Wensink Farm Seeds, Inc. are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of any hazardous substance from our facility.  This facility has utilized hazardous products for over forty years without one off-site accidental release.  However, if an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to our neighbors and the environment.  The facility has implemented every constructive suggestion from local fire departments, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Ohio Department of Agriculture's Fertilizer Division, to improve its safety agenda.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\n     This facility is an agricultural based organization which not only produces and processes seeds, but also markets agricultural fertilizers and chemicals to farmers.  One fertilizer, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to farmers to be used as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored at our facility, in locked storage tanks, is 1,072,700 pounds.  The largest tank  is 30,000 gallons and contains 140,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would occur during the unloading of a delivery tanker holding approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or signific"

The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\n     This anhydrous ammonia facility has:  (a.)  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 1910.38, ( b.)  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know-information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA), and ( c.)  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n     Safety improvement is on on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
