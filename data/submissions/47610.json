      "SummaryText": "GENERAL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR GIUMARRA VINEYARDS BOTTLING PLANT\r\n\r\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Giumarra Vineyards are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass a bottling plant that utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our bottling facility is 7710.00 lbs.\r\n\r\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration/South.  In this scenario 7710 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  This release would affect a total population of 500 persons, according to LandView 5.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from liquid anhydrou"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 30 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles with no affected persons according to LandView 5.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release of gaseous anhydrous ammonia from a broken pipe.  The scenario involves the release of 1800 lbs. of gaseous ammonia.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 30 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of minimizing the release.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).    Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles.  According to LandView 5, there are no affected persons.\r\n\r\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nGiumarra Vineyards maintains records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operat"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of annually.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed in December of 2006 and is an on-going project.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Giumarra Vineyards maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nGiumarra Vineyards has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nGiumarra Vineyards carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Maintenance and inspections are performed by California Controlled Atmospheres/Fresno, CA. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized trainin"

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed in December of 2006.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Giumarra Vineyards.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nGiumarra Vineyards conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted July 18, 2003.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nGiumarra Vineyards promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nGiumarra Vineyards truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Giumarra Vineyards has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.    Five-year Accident History\r\nGiumarra Vineyards has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has not been an unauthorized or accidental release during the five-year reporting period from this facility\r\n\r\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\r\nGiumarra Vineyards carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n7.
