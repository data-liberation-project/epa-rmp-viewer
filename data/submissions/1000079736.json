The plant has also implemented all the elements of William's Integrated Management System (WIMS), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. The Larose Cryogenic Plant's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Williams Field Services - Larose Facility is a natural gas processing plant that receives natural gas from pipelines and separates the gas stream via fractionation into pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane) and natural gas liquids (NGLs) (ethane, propane, butanes, and natural gasoline). The Products from the facility are transferred via commercial pipeline.  The regulated chemicals in the process are:\n\nMethane\n\nEthane\n\nPropane\n\ni-Butane\n\nButane\n\ni-Pentane\n\nPentane \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Larose Cryogenic Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards In the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): The Larose Cryogenic Plant uses PSSRs as a part of the construction process. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity: Larose Cryogenic Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices utilized by the Larose Cryogenic Plant include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and    exit of support personnel, and lock out tag out procedures to ensure isolation of energy source"
