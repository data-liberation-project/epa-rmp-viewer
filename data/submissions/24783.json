If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to the population and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary risk management activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers to farm producers in the area.  Haveman Grain Company has operated this facility in Murray, Nebraska for approximately 24 years.   The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this site is approximately 191,000 pounds.   This figure includes bulk storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release of anhydrous ammonia from our main storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 2.6 miles.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Scenario:  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.3 miles\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nDuring periods of non operation the local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections at various times during the day and night.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour telephone number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, not to our knowledge, hav"
