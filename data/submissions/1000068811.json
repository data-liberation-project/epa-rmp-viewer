      "SummaryText": "The Leavenworth Waterworks Plant No. 1 is a water treatment plant that processes water pumped from the Missouri River into drinking water and provides water supply for the City of Leavenworth and surrounding areas.  The raw river water is settled, lime-softened, clarified, filtered and disinfected prior to distribution.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water to make it safe for public consumption and use.  The maximum amount of chlorine located at Plant No. 1, at any given time, is 8,000 pounds.  This maximum amount is determined by the size of the chlorine storage building.\r\n\r\nChlorine at Plant No. 1 is stored and used within a building enclosure that protects the containers, the feed equipment, and the controls.  The building is equipped with ventilation and it is heated during the winter months to maintain proper chlorine feed rates and prevent moisture condensation and corrosion.  Only chlorine gas is withdrawn from the containers during use.\r\n\r\nChlorine containers in use are stored in Chlortainers, as chlorine gas is withdrawn and fed into the water treatment process for disinfection.  Chlortainers are specialized safety equipment that provide full encasement of the ton chlorine containers and allow for complete confinement of any leak that may occur in the container.  Chlorine gas is fed under vacuum conditions such that any failure in the chlorine feed line shuts off the flow of chlorine gas automatically and no gas leak may occur from the feed line.\r\n\r\nThe Leavenworth Waterworks Plant No. 1 employs State certified water plant operators to operate this facility and uses OEM contractors to provide maintenance services on specialized equipment such as the chlorination feed and storage systems.  Industry standards and manufacturers recommendation are followed and documented to assure safe operation of the chlorination equipment.\r\n\r\nIn the five years preceding, April 2018, there have been no accidental releases from the covered process (chlorine) at Leavenworth"

In the history of this plant, there has never been an accidental release of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policy of our facility relies on the Leavenworth Fire Dept. and our stationary source is included in the community emergency response plan.  Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify the Fire Dept. if there is a need for a response.  The Plant No. 1 employees have written procedures to follow for making the emergency call, securing the plant, and evacuating the facility.\r\n\r\nThe off-site consequences of a worst case scenario chlorine gas release and an alternative scenario chlorine gas release have been evaluated and are on file with the EPA and local emergency responders.\r\n\r\nOngoing and regular training of water plant personnel in the safe handling and use of chlorine is done to maintain safe and effective use of this chemical."
