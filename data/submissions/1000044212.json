This RMP/CalARP, submitted by Applied Energy LLC (AE LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal; there have been no process changes to the SCR NOx Control System(per 40 CFR Part 68.190) since June 21, 1999.\n\n\n\nAs background for this facility, AE LLC is the current owner/operator. Applied Energy, Inc. (AEI) was the original owner/operator of the facility that prepared a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) for handling anhydrous ammonia (NH3) at this facility in October 1996, and submitted the RMPP to the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health Hazardous Materials Division (HMD) under the former California RMPP rule.  HMD approved the RMPP for this facility on January 14, 1997.  HMD granted approval for AE LLC to revise and update the existing RMPP and submit it as a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to U.S. EPA and HMD under the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program; the RMP/CalARP document was submitted on June 21, 1999. For purposes of this update and resubmittal, the previous references to AEI are replaced by AE LLC in this document.\n\n\n\nAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of AE LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located at North Island (NORIS) in the City and County of San Diego, California.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIE"

It is the firm policy of AE LLC to fully and faithfully comply with all requirements, both substantive and reporting, of all environmental, health, and safety statues, regulations, ordinances, and permits affecting the operations and maintenance of our plants.  AE LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in the PSM/RMP/CalARP document maintained onsite.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe cogeneration facility is located at the corner of Rogers and Quay Road in San Diego, California, within U.S. Navy property.  The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\n\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontally mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,500 gallons, but The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 3,825 gallons (19,700 pounds).  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 51,332 gallons. \n\n\n\nAE LLC also used anhydrous ammonia in a refrigeration system for cooling the gas turbine inlet air.  The Chiller system was installed at NORIS in 1992 and used a maximum of 15,000 gallons of ammonia within the closed-loop system. Following the ammonia release within the Chiller system on November 29, 2012, the facility has pumped down the system and re-evaluated the need for the system. AE LLC has determined that the Chiller system is no longer necessary and currently decommissioning the system.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEAS"

The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.\n\n\n\nThe AE LLC facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.  AE LLC's process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distribution Control System. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia handling process includes relief, isolation, and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions.  These safety mechanisms allow the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank.\n\n\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown and inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedural checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking "

An additional operator was called in to assist and upon his arrival it was determined that the leak was coming from a gauge line under the 1000 HP chiller. The Federal Fire Dept., National Response Center (NRC) and San Diego County Department of Environmental Health (DEH) were all notified. The leak was quickly isolated and the fire department cleared the area. It was determined that a gauge had come out of the 1/4\" line. This gauge had been recently replaced by the ammonia contractor and it appears it was not tightened completely.   \n\n\n\nNo more than 5 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia had been released. The plant manager followed up with NRC with the determination that the release was below the reportable quantity and the agency confirmed no further follow up or action was required. The DEH likewise stated no further action was required. No injuries or offsite impacts were reported as a result of this release.\n\n\n\nThe only corrective action from this release, was updating the operating procedures to state that the gauge is now isolated when not in use as the gauge is only used while the suction cooling pressure is being adjusted.\n\n\n\nOn November 29, 2012 the C"

      "SummaryText": "ontrol Room Operator (CRO) received an alarm showing NOx levels going up. The CRO started to shut down the unit and chiller. Shortly after shutdown the CRO received an alarm that a smoke detector was activated in an electrical room. The operator went to investigate and smelled ammonia and notified 911 and the site manager. The CRO initiated the deluge system for the chiller unit. A relief valve on the chiller unit had opened, releasing ammonia to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe North Island Navy Base Hazmat Team responded and the system was shutdown using the King Valve. This isolated the receiver and slowed the release. Within 50 minutes the release appeared to be stopped. Several base buildings were evacuated with other personnel being requested to shelter in place. No employees or base personnel were injured.\n\n\n\nThe 3 way valve was later isolated by the remediation contractor. It was determined that a faulty pilot valve in the ammonia blow down system closed slowly enough to allow hot ammonia vapor to meet with cold liquid ammonia leading to a hydrostatic hammer causing the 300 psig relief valve to lift. Small metal debris caused the valve to not reseat, continuing the release. \n\n\n\nThe incident lasted approximately 5 hours and released 710 pounds of ammonia. All notifications (NRC, Cal-EMA, and DEH) were made in timely manner. The chiller system has been pumped down and is currently being decommissioned. \n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia releases associated with the SCR NOx Control system.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAE LLC has developed a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes the following information describing the actions of employees over the course of a release event:\n\n\n\n- Alarm system activation and signal interpretation\n\n- Safe evacuation, assembly locations and return to the facility\n\n- Selection of response strategies based on type of incident\n\n- Incident command structure and emergency contact"
