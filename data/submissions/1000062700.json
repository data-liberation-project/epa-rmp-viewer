      "SummaryText": "STANTON ENERGY CENTER RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\n\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center is a division of Orlando Utilities Commission, headquartered in Orlando, Florida. Corporate policy requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site. The Corporate environmental organization provides support to the sites in the form of advice and direction on regulatory compliance issues, budgeting and procurement of environmental services, and assistance in the development of new programs. The Safety & Technical Training organization manages the training for site employees, RMP, and PSM program at Stanton Energy Center.\n\n\n\n1.    Description of Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center Unit 2 stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in two 30,000 gallon tanks for addition to the Selective Catalytic Reduction System at Unit 2. Although the tanks have a total capacity of 60,000 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading, Storage and Supply procedure limits the tank levels to 85% of capacity, or a maximum total inventory of 51,000 gallons. This is equivalent to approximately 259,000 lbs. of ammonia at Unit 2. Similarly, Unit B also stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in one 15,000 gallon tank for addition to its Selective Catalytic Reduction System. This tank is also administratively limited in its fill capacity. At 85% of capacity, the anhydrous ammonia storage tank at Unit B contains approximately 13,000 gallons, or 65,000 lbs. of ammonia. Both processes exceed the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n2.    Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM Program also serves as the RMP prevention plan. The PSM Program was established in 1994 for the former chlorine process and was extended to cover the ammonia process when the SCR system was constructed in 1996. Improv"
