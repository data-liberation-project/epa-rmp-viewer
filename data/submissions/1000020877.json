Over the past years, HCWD#1 has spent $20,000 for a building to store and confine (quantity) 4 - ton cylinders of chlorine.  To minimize escaping cl2 gas, a cl2 gas detector was installed to set off alarms if a cl2 leak is detected over 3 ppm ( parts per million).  If this situation ever occurs, HCWD#1 has a planned course of action to notify surrounding residences, police, medical personnel, fire department, and local government agencies.                                                                                                                                                    \n\nPWP's plan for accidental prevention is following Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs) that are reviewed and updated annually and state the guidelines for handling cl2, daily inspections by the operators of the equipment used in the processes, and routine maintenance on the equipment used in the processes.  Emergency responce procedures at our facility are as follows.\n\n1. Notify the facility emergency response coordinator or the alternate(s) of the potential problem.\n\n\n\n2. Put on the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) - i.e. SCBA, rubber gloves, etc.)\n\n\n\n3. Verify leak visually with ammonia.  The detector should also be reset as changes in the temperature may cause the alarm to inadvertently activate.                                                                     \n\n\n\n4. Should a substantial leak be confirmed, PWP personnel will evacuate with the plant emergency cell phone (which is kept by the operators control computer) and a copy of the Tab-Q-7 (which is kept in both PWP vehicles).\n\n\n\n5. Prior to exiting the PWP grounds, PWP personnel should observe and note wind direction.  Wind direction will dictate personnel evacuation route as well as emergency res"
