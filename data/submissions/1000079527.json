After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\r\n\r\n- Compliance Audits: Every 3 years, we examine the\r\nRisk management in detail to identify areas for improvement.\r\n\r\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets\r\nprogram in case confidential information affecting the safety of the\r\nammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\r\n\r\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing\r\nprogress of safety items.\r\n\r\n-Planned changes to improve safety: Arctic Glacier, believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Arctic Glacier continues to look for, develop, and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards.
