Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \n\nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nArctic Glacier is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\n\nfor our employees and the surrounding community.

After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\n\n\n- Compliance Audits: Every 3 years, we examine the\n\nRisk management in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets\n\nprogram in case confidential information affecting the safety of the\n\nammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\n\n\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing\n\nprogress of safety items.\n\n\n\n-Planned changes to improve safety: Arctic Glacier, believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.
