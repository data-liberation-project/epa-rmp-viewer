      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION \n\nSandvik Materials Technology/Pennsylvania Extruded Tube Co. facility (Company)  is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Company workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Company established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Company and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at this facility.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule (\u00a768.150 through \u00a768.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at this facility.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nThe Company is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, the Company controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES  \n\nThe Pennsylvania Extruded Tube Company processes stainless steel and uses aqueous hydrofluoric (HF) acid in its stainless steel pickling and deglassing processes.  HF acid at solution concentrations of 50 wt% or greater are regulated by the RMP rule, and although only dilute (about 4 to 8 wt%) HF acid solutions are used in the pickling and deglassing tanks, HF acid at a solution concentration of  70 wt% is stored in a large tank at the facility for use in the processes.\n\nA maximum of 5,000 gallons of 70 wt% HF acid is stored in one 5,000 gal"

      "SummaryText": "lon tank located at the facility.  The weight of HF acid in 5,000 gallons of 70 wt% solution is just under 51,000 lb, which exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity (1,000 lb) for HF acid in a process.  Because the HF acid storage process is not covered by the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulation and because the potential exists for off-site consequences resulting from an accidental release of HF acid, the HF bulk storage process falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program.\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe RMP rule requires the Company to perform an offsite consequence analysis for one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for aqueous HF acid, a toxic substance.  The worst-case release scenario is catastrophic failure of the 5,000 gallon tank releasing 51,000 lb of aqueous HF acid (70 wt%).  A diked area contains the released aqueous HF acid, which evaporates, forming a vapor cloud.   Migration of a hydrofluoric acid vapor cloud to offsite receptors will be controlled and minimized by using an existing water deluge system.  Trained emergency response personnel, equipped with the required personal protective equipment are onsite and can immediately initiate the control procedures identified in the Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan (PPC Plan).\n\nAn agreement has been executed with an Emergency Response Contractor who will respond to a spill or release if site personnel should require assistance during a catastrophic chemical release.  Additionally, an offsite Emergency Response Plan for this facility has been developed by the Lackawanna County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for aqueous hydrofluoric acid is a discharge from a 1/2-inch diameter rupture in a pipe located at the bottom of the tank.  This scenario assumes that the solution is released through the opening for 60 minutes before workers detect the release and isolate the pipe.  The r"

The vapor cloud would be knocked down, and offsite migration of the vapor cloud controlled by utilizing a water deluge system located at the tank farm.  Personnel trained in emergency response procedures, and which are identified in a current Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan are readily available to implement control methods which would minimize offsite migration of an acid vapor cloud.\n\nThe US EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance was used to determine the offsite impact.\n\nPopulation data was obtained from U.S. Census Bureau Software \"Landview III\".\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe RMP rule requires a Program 2 prevention program for the aqueous HF acid bulk storage process.  The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at the facility that apply to these units.\n\nThe Company maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the facility processes.  Material safety data sheets document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at this facility, including HF acid.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe Company performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the HF acid storage process to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure that this plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Company develops and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.

A training documentation electronic database is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe Company properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nPeriodic compliance audits of covered processes are performed to verify that the facility processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\fIncident Investigations\n\nAll incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, are investigated by the Company.  The Company trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancement are implemented.\n\nHF Acid-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIndustry standards are followed at the facility to help ensure safe handling of aqueous HF acid.  The vendor supplies aqueous HF acid via a Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the aqueous HF acid storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with A.S.M.E. standards."
