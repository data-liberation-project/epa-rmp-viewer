Proper handling equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations. Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance. The plant will contact the City of Longview Fire Department for assistance with chemical releases. The local Hazmat team will then be contacted by the fire department if needed. The First Call emergency contact system is available for facilities in Gregg County. The fire department will initiate contact with the First Call program for emergency notification assistance.\r\n\r\nThe City of Longview Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Material Incidents is identified in detail in the RMP with copies of the forms for emergency notification. These emergency notification forms include: Emergency Public Information Checklist for Hazardous Material Incident, Sample Radio/TV Message for Unidentified Spill/Release in Heavy Traffic Area, Sample Radio/TV Message for Low Hazard/Confined Spill/Release-No General Evacuation, Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release-In Place Sheltering, Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release-General Evacuation, and Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release-School"
