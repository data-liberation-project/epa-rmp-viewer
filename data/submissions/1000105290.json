      "SummaryText": "UNFI-Centralia is a new fresh and frozen food distribution center. The facility is located outside the City of Centralia, Lewis County, Washington, in a rural setting.  This Risk Management Plan was conducted to fulfill the requirements of EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 under the Clean Air Act.  The hazardous material used in the refrigeration system is anhydrous ammonia.  The threshold quantity for this regulated substance is 10,000 lbs.  UNFI's intended inventory will be approximately 35,000 lbs to meet cold and freezer room temperature requirements. Initially 24,000 lbs was charged to the system for startup on July 2, 2019.  Future addition of ammonia will be made only after a Management of Change has been completed to verify no additional risks with be added.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system was constructed and built to ASME and all applicable codes and standards.  Certificates of compliance are included in the operators' manuals, kept in the refrigeration mechanic's office.  UNFI follows all applicable standards in the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers) Handbook, ASME, ANSI, IIAR and RAGAGEP standards.  The State of Washington Department of Labor and Industries will make regular inspections of the pressure vessels.  Certificates issued will be kept in the compressor room.\r\n\r\nThe following are the safety devices installed on the refrigeration system:\r\n   *Suction trap hi-level float\r\n   *High Discharge pressure shut down\r\n   *Low suction pressure shut down\r\n   *High discharge temperature shut down\r\n   *Oil pressure failure shut down\r\n   *High amperes shut down\r\n   *Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\r\n   *Oil filters plugged shut down\r\n   *250 psi relief valves on high pressure side\r\n   *31 nh3 Detectors\r\n   *47 nh3 horn and light alarms\r\n\r\nThe following operating limits have been applied:\r\n   *Maximum designed discharge pressure - 250 psig\r\n   *Maximum designed saturated discharge temperature - 126 f"
