Refinery employees are encouraged to participate in various activities that are directly related to a good hazard prevention program.  Employees participate in the Plant Safety Committee, where items reviewed in this committee are the result of incident investigations, status of safety work orders (most of them created by them), and engineering requests, unit inspection minutes and any significant safety concern.   They participate in the Process Hazards Analysis of the units in the Refinery giving their experience and expressing their view of the process being evaluated.  They also participate in Incident investigations where root cause analyses are conducted and findings are developed to reduce or mitigate hazards that resulted from an incident.\n\n  \n \n Process Safety Information\n \n Process Safety information is available to all employees at the different control room areas.  Access to information related to the chemicals used in the Units, including a list of such chemicals, as well as the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for them are available.   There is also information about the technology of the process, flow or block diagrams to show the process.

The group members are selected based on the process to be analyzed.  Typically its composition is a Team Leader (with knowledge of the PHA's techniques), an operating representative (knowledge of the unit to be studied), a technical representative (engineering) and a maintenance representative.  A systematic approach is used in order to conduct these studies.  It can be a Checklist, a What If or a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  Results of these studies are documented, and records of implementation and follow up are maintained.  \n \n Operating Procedures\n \n Shell Chemical Yabucoa Inc. Refinery maintains procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n There is a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees are required to complete an Apprenticeship Training Program.  This program includes classroom training, formal in-unit training, on the job training; self study training, written and hands-on tests.  The program includes basic skills training, qualifying on a set number of jobs at the assigned un"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.\n \n Pre-Startup Safety Review\n \n For any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information a Pre-Start Up Safety Review is conducted.  The purpose of the pre-start up safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all support systems are operationally ready.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n \n Compliance Audits\n \n Corporate compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  This ensures that the Process Safety Program is being maintained as required.  This is accomplished by conducting a formal evaluation and certification.  The Refinery Process Safety Manager follows up on the programs on a regular basis to verify compliance of the elements of the PSM program.\n \n \n Incident Investigation\n \n The purpose of an Incident Reporting and Investigation procedure is to establish a consistent and effective system of internal reporting.
