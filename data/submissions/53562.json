Per 40 CFR 68.155, the owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n(d) The five-year accident history;\n(e) The emergency response program; and\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility: The Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC A? Taft Terminal (Facility) complies with OSHAA?s 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is KNCA?s policy to notify the Louisiana State Police and the Saint Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: The Facility handles, receives, and stores anhydrous ammonia, which is used for industrial and agricultural purposes.  The anhydrous ammonia is received by ship and stored at the Facility in two cryogenic storage tanks (50,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia per tank) and two pressurized tanks (one 156 ton bullet tank and one 77.34 ton bullet tank) until it is either (a) loaded onto a ship or barge or (b) injected into a third-party pipeline for further transport or distribution.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance stored at the Facility in amounts above threshold quantity. The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 200,466,680 pounds. The Facility is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program of the chemical accident prevention provisions (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\nSome release preventive features at the Facility include:\n? Emergency shutdown buttons at the barge and ship loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the ship/barge crew in case of an ammonia release.\n? Surge bladders on the ship/barge loading lines to absorb the shock during a sudden closure of the valve due to emergency shutdown.\n? A firewater deluge system on top of the cryogenic ammonia tanks.\n? Ammonia sensors in the process areas and on the property to detect ammonia.\n\nThe five-year accident history: Two accidental releases over reportable quantities have occurred over the past five years resulting in neighboring facilities voluntarily sheltering in place.  These two releases did not result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, required sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  Both releases were reported to regulatory agencies.  In the abundance of caution, KNC has included these incidents in the RMP Accident History.\n\nOn June 19, 2009, a KNC employee was exposed to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia on his legs.  The employee was taken to a local emergency room, treated for exposure, and released the same day.  Approximately 80 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released from a block valve during a maintenance operation.  The cause of the release was human error and improper procedure, and, as a result, KNC updated its procedures.  This release was reported to regulatory agencies.  \n\nThe emergency response program: The Facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergenc"

The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None identified at this time.\n"
