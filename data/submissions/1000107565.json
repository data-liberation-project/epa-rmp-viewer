      "SummaryText": "I. Introduction to Risk Management Plan\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published regulations and guidance for chemical accident prevention at facilities that handle hazardous chemicals, which can be found in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule. The facilities which handle certain hazardous chemicals, must develop a Risk Management Plan, which [1]: \n1.\tidentifies the potential effects of a chemical accident\n2.\tidentifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident\n3.\tspells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur\nThe list of regulated substances under the RMP program can be found in the following link: https://www.epa.gov/rmp/list-regulated-substances-under-risk-management-plan-rmp-program. When a facility is built, and the chemicals handled are above the listed threshold quantity, the company needs to implement a risk management program, develop the RMP, and submit it to the EPA. \nThe plan must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years.\nPer the requirements of the RMP rule, this document addresses the following [1]:\n1.\tHazard assessment that details the potential effects of an accidental release, an accident history of the last five years, and an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental releases\n2.\tPrevention program that includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring, and employee training measures\n3.\tEmergency response program that spells out emergency health care, employee training measures and procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g., the fire department) should an accident occur\n?\nII. RMP Inventory Summary\nAn inventory of RMP regulated substances at the Roaring Fork Midstream North Silo Crude Oil Terminal was developed utilizing the volumes of vessels and associated process piping shown on the facility Process and Instrument Diagrams (P&IDs).

RMP Program Level Determination\nNorth Silo Crude Oil Terminal Location\nRoaring Fork Midstream (Roaring Fork) owns and operates the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal in Laramie County, Wyoming. The facility address is 2678 US 85, Cheyenne, WY 82009, with coordinates 41.387\u00b0N, 104.510\u00b0W. An aerial photograph of the area around the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal, including a facility plot plan is presented in Appendix A.\nDefinitions of RMP Program Level\nThe RMP rule defines three different program levels based on the potential for public impacts and the efforts needed to prevent accidents [2].\nRMP Program Level 1 (Level 1): Processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release; in the language of Part 68, processes \u0093with no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release\u0094. Additionally, these processes must have had no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years to be eligible for Level 1, which imposes limited hazard assessment requirements and minimal prevention and emergency response requirements.\nRMP Program Level 2 (Level 2): Processes not eligible for Level 1 or subject to Level 3 are placed in Level 2, which imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements. \nRMP Program Level 3 (Level 3): Processes not eligible for Level 1 and either subject to Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 1910.119 under federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specified North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes are placed in Level 3, which imposes OSHA\u0092s PSM standard as the prevention program as well as additi"

Using the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal coordinates and entering the distance to 1 psi overpressure, MARPLOT provides the population affected by the offsite consequences based on the 2010 census data. \nWithin MARPLOT, there is one (1) public receptor (housing unit) within the \u0093worst-case\u0094 scenario for V-450 or V-460.  However, the latest satellite imagery from Google Earth, the MARPLOT Map, and onsite verification, have confirmed that there are zero (0) public receptors within any \u0093worst-case\u0094 scenario at the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal.\nA plot plan of the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal and 1-psi overpressure contour for the worst-case scenario (0.5 miles) is presented in Figure 3 in Appendix C along with additional detailed information regarding the offsite consequence analysis using RMP*Comp and the MARPLOT population results.\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nBecause this is an RMP Program 1 facility, no analysis of Alternative Release Scenarios was required. \n\nIV.

A copy of the RMP filed with the EPA containing the RMP required information is available in Appendix D.\nExecutive Summary \u0096 North Silo Crude Oil Terminal\nRoaring Fork has a standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility-trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nRoaring Fork Midstream owns and operates a crude oil terminal, the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal, in Laramie County, Wyoming. The North Silo Crude Oil Terminal receives crude oil from various field production facilities in the area via pipelines and trucks.  The crude oil is stored in internal floating roof crude oil storage tanks.  Butane is trucked in from offsite and unloaded into pressurized butane storage tanks.  The butane and crude oil are blended in a static mixer (the blended product is not stored on site) before being sent off-site via pipeline. \nThe regulated flammable substance in the process is butane.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nEmployee Participation\nRoaring Fork encourages employees to participate in all aspects of RMP and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan which is ma"

These documents address (a) chemical properties and associated hazards, (b) limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and (c) equipment design basis/configuration information. \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\nFor specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition). The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nRoaring Fork has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nPHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience in"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a qualitative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. The final recommendations are tracked to closure, and resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility, or at minimum of every five years. The results and findings from these updates are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe North Silo Crude Oil Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for the training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to maintain correctness and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available in the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the North Silo Crude Oil Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years, or more frequently if requested. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\nContractors\nThe North Silo Crude Oil Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) and Management of Change (MOC)\nRoaring Fork has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.
