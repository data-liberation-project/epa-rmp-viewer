This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00c2\u00bfs primary activities encompass warehousing.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Formaldehyde (solution), Ammonia (aqueous) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid.  All substances are warehoused for the purpose of resale.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (solution) at our facility is 38,415.00 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid are present at our facility in quantities of 198,462.00 lb. and 2,500.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario 499 lbs. of Formaldehyde (solution) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 60 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 37% of the maximum capacity of the sour"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 56 lbs. The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by neutralization. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.06 miles.

Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by  neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
