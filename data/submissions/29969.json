      "SummaryText": "The Phenix City Water Filtration Plant is a 10.8 MGD surface water treatment facility.  The average daily output is approximately 7.0 MGD.  The plant is located at 1100 32nd Street in Phenix City, Alabama.  This plant is designed to produce a safe supply of drinking water from the Chattahoochee River.  The plant utilizes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration processes.  The final stage is disinfection.  In the disinfection process a hazardous chemical, chlorine, is injected to kill pathogenic organisms.  Because of the large amounts required, enough of the chemicals must be stored onsite to support the demand of the system.  The amount ranges from 6000-12000 pounds.  The area in which chemicals are stored is ventilated, and is equipped with a dual point leak detection device.  A minimal leak will be detected and the unit will then actuate the alarm system which includes a an alarm bell and a remote alarm located in the operations building to warn plant personnel of a possible emergency situation.  This facility is equipped with self contained breathing apparatus and Chlorine Institute emergency chlorine repair kits for ton cylinders.  The plant personnel are all trained professionals and are frequently instructed on safe and correct operational and emergency procedures.  No accidents have occurred as a result of the use or accidental release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past 10 years.  A worst case scenario release of either of these chemicals could result in the possible evacuation within a 0.9 mile radius of the plant.  The local fire department is aware of the location and effects of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  In the event of a worst case leak, the Phenix City Fire Department would handle the situation.  The Russell County Emergency Management Agency would also assist with any emergency evacuation or other procedures as needed.  The plant personnel are continuously trained and made aware of any changes in procedures.  The "
