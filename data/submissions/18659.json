If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n* - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for sale to farmers.\n* - The maximum quantity stored would be 170,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE CASE SCENARIO\n     The worst case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release from the largest vessel identified as holding 170,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure by design standards.  By using RMP*Comp it was determined that a release of this would meet the endpoint of 2 miles.  The impact would be on residents of about 2,500.  \n     The alternative case release of anhydrous ammonia was to demonstrate an overfilled tank while off loading.  The case would show a release of 100 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period with an effect of a reading of 0.1 mile to the toxic endpoint.  Estimated receptors would be 250 people.\n  \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of amhydrous ammonia\".\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n     It was found that there has been no accidents or reportable off-premises release at this facility.  The emergency response program is on file with the Local Emergency Planning Coordinator.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions."
