Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Maryville Wastewater Treatment Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the City of Maryville Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is, as the name describes, a wastewater treatment facility serving Blount County and a few surrounding areas. There are two regulated substances present at the facility. These substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is used in the treatment of wastewater. Sulfur dioxide is used to de-chlorinate the water before releasing into the river. \n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine is 16,000 pounds. \nThe maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide is 8,000 pounds. \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency. This facility is also subject to the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nThe following section briefly describes the elements of our release prevention program.\n \nProcess Safety Information \nThe City of Maryville Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of the written safety information that des"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses was the What If/Checklist. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining\nThe facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees operating covered processes are completely competent in the operating procedures. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe wastewater plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: piping systems, relief and vent systems and controls. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered trainin"

These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations. \n\nCompliance Audits\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation\nThe facility has a policy to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of  chlorine or sulfur dioxide. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe management of the Wastewater Treatment Plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning safety issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the implementation to the RMP rule. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, we hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Contractors are informed of the potential hazards related to the work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of procedures for emergency response in the event that an accidental release should occur. \n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years . Due to stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period. \n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nA written emergency respons"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nExtensive maintenance was completed in 2008 and 2009 for both the SO2 and CL2 systems. Specific measures included the installation of a vacuum feed system for both chemical trains and inspection, repair, or replacement of existing piping.\n"
