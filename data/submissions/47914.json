Ammonia is also stored.  Some of the compounds handled are considered hazardous by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  We insist on strict adherence to safety precautions developed to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health, as well as the safety and health of our coworkers and minimize the threat to our community and the environment.  Our safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the proper maintenance of the safety systems designed in these facilities, the procedures used by our personnel and the training of these personnel.  \n\nOur safety programs are modeled after the ACC?s Codes of Responsible Care.  Our emergency response plan, which is based on OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation, contains procedures for notification of the local Emergency Management Authority, local fire department, and potentially affected neighbors.  Neighbor notification can take the form of an automated telephone ring down system, sponsored by local industry.  The telephone system is augmented by a network of sirens surrounding the plant site, which can be activated by either Emergency Management or Plant personnel.\n\n    This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n    The primary purpose of this facility is to convert ammonia and alcohols into a variety of chemical intermediates. These include  methylamines, dimethyl urea, and higher amines.  All products are used by our customers in the production of other comp"
