      "SummaryText": "Compressor Station #102, (CS-102) is located approximately 30 miles south of Havre, Montana, in the SE1/4 of the NW1/4 of Section 26, Township 27 North, Range 16 East, Chouteau County, Montana.  It is operated by Havre Pipeline Company, LLC.  CS-102 performs three primary functions which may be classified as four processes.  The first process is to gather and compress nearby field gas, which is accomplished through the use of natural gas-driven compressor engines.  The second process is to remove moisture from the gas prior to its entering the transmission system through the use of a dehydrator unit.  The third process is to cool the gas to remove the heavier light hydrocarbons from the gas stream in order to meet pipeline natural gas quality standards.\n\nThe fourth process comprises the on-site storage of the hydrocarbons (also called LPG mix) that are removed from the gas stream.  The LPG mix is stored on-site until a maximum quantity has been accumulated in a pressurized storage bullet.  The storage bullet has a maximum capacity of 10,000 gallons and a design MAOP of 250 psi.  The normal storage pressure is approximately 40 psi.  The storage bullet is removed from the site when it reaches 80 percent of capacity.  The contents of the LPG is typically a mix of propane and light hydrocarbon liquids.  The national Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) 704 flammability rating of the LPG mixture is 4, making the mixture potentially subject to 40 CFR 68 rules.\n\nThe maximum quantity of LPG mix that could be realeased at one time is 8,000 gallons.  Assuming the capacity of the storage tank is 3.7 lbs per gallon (typical of propane storage tanks), the worst case scenario would release 29,600 pounds of flammable material.  The worst case scenario assumes that the total amount of LPG is released at one time forming a vapor cloud which then detonates.   Damage to people or structure from the detonation pressure wave is assumed to occur to a distance of 1 psi overpressure, or 0.3 "

      "SummaryText": "miles.  The nearest public receptor to CS-102 is a residence at a distance of 1.5 miles.\n\nThe LPG storage bullet was installed approximately 1 year ago, therefore, there has not been an accidental release at CS-102 in the past 5 years.  Since there are no public receptors within the 1 psi overpressure distance and there have been no accidental releases in the past 5 years, this process is eligible for Program 1.  The accident prevention procedures at CS-102 are in accordance with the NFPA LP-Gas Code 58 and other applicable state and local laws. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan for Havre Pipeline covers CS-102.  HPC currently holds Air Quality Permit (AQP)#2771-06 for the CS-102 facility."
