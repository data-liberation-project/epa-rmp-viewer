      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nHaliburton International Foods is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators / refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations.  Haliburton International Foods has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nHaliburton International Foods is located at 3855 E. Jurupa Street in Ontario, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the processing and storage of frozen food products.  The system uses a maximum of 10,856 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Evaporative Condenser to the High Pressure Receiver.  The High Pressure Receiver feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the +20?F Pump Recirculator.  \n\n\n\nThe +20?F Pump Recirculator receives high temperature recirculated suction from Evaporators AU-11 - AU-25, AU-8 - AU-10 (depending on the operation) and the Heat Exchangers and high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver.  The high pressure liquid ammonia feed to the vessel is controlled by a level controller which throttles the motorized valve to maintain operating level in the vessel.  Incomi"

Sub-cooled liquid is sent to the -20?F Pump Recirculator.  Liquid is also pumped to Evaporators AU-11 - AU-25, AU-8 - AU-10 (depending on operation) and the Glycol Chiller Heat Exchanger as high temperature recirculated liquid.  High stage suction is drawn from the top of the vessel by the High Stage Compressors and the Swing Compressor.  The vessel is equipped with a high level mechanical float switch that shuts down the Compressors in the event of a high level situation. Additionally there is a liquid transfer vessel that will transfer excess liquid in the +20?F Pump Recirculator to the High Pressure Receiver in a high level situation.\n\n\n\nThe -20?F Pump Recirculator receives low temperature recirculated suction from Evaporators AU-1 - AU-7 and AU-8 - AU-10 (depending on the operation) and sub-cooled liquid ammonia from the +20?F Pump Recirculator.  The sub-cooled liquid ammonia feed to the vessel is controlled by a level controller which throttles the motorized valve to maintain operating level in the vessel.  Liquid is also pumped to Evaporators AU-1 - AU-7 and AU-8 - AU-10 (depending on the operation) as low temperature recirculated liquid.  Low stage suction is drawn from the top of the vessel by the Low Stage Compressors and the Swing Compressor.  The vessel is equipped with a high level mechanical float switch that shuts down the Compressors in the event of a high level situation. Additionally there is a liquid transfer line that will activate a solenoid to transfer the excess liquid back to the +20?F Pump Recirculator in a high level situation.\n\n\n\nThe Evaporators provide refrigeration to the -10?F Freezer (AU-1 - AU-7), Convertible Area (AU-8 - AU-10), Engine Room (AU-11), +38?F Dock (AU-12 & AU-13), Produce Coolers 1 & 2 (AU-14 - AU-19), Packaging (AU-20 - AU-22), and USDA (AU-23 - AU-25).

The Convertible Area Evaporators (AU-8 - AU-10) can receive low temperature or high temperature recirculated liquid depending on the operation. At the Evaporators, ammonia flows through the evaporator coils and is partially boiled as fans blow air over the evaporator coils.  The resulting 'wet return' (liquid/vapor mixture) from the Evaporators returns to the respective vessel.  The -10?F Freezer Evaporators and Convertible Area Evaporators receive hot gas for coil defrost.\n\n\n\nThe Low Stage Compressors draw low stage suction from the -20?F Pump Recirculator and the High Stage Compressors draw high stage suction from the +20?F Pump Recirculator.  The Swing Compressor can be configured to draw suction from either Recirculator, depending on demand.  High stage discharge flows to the Evaporative Condenser and is routed to the Underfloor Heat Exchanger to warm glycol and to the Freezer and Convertible Evaporators for coil defrost.  All of the Compressors are water-cooled.\n\n\n\nThe Underfloor Heat Exchanger is a plate and frame heat exchanger which is designed to be used in a separate, closed loop system for under floor heating.  The Underfloor Heat Exchanger receives hot gas from the Compressors.  As hot gas passes through the heat exchanger unit, it is condensed as the glycol absorbs heat from the ammonia.  The resulting liquid drains to the Evaporative Condenser.\n\n\n\nAt the Evaporative Condenser, air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the high stage discharge from the Compressors into high pressure liquid, which then drains to the High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.  The system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensables, i.e. air, from the system.\n\n\n\nAll p"

All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the Ammonia Dilution Tank at 250 psig or 300 psig, depending on location in the system.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nHaliburton International Foods has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the EPA RMP regulation.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n\n- Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n\n- Training for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n- Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations;\n\n- Written procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\n\n- Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\n\n- Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\n\n- Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n\n- Employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property d"

In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHaliburton International Foods has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor and the fire department for assistance as necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis studies and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Haliburton International Foods has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n"
