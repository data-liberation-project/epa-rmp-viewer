      "SummaryText": "ual Aid agreement\r\nwith Surry County and State of North Carolina Emergency Response agencies to respond to any \r\nmajor incidents occurring at NCFI's location.\r\n\r\nNCFI is proud of their accident free record and managerment of incidents of released material.\r\nDuring the last five years there has been no accident or incident involving a reportable\r\nrelease of the TDI material.\r\n \r\nNCFI's Worst Case Scenario was determined to be the loss of the entire contents of the largest \r\nstorage vessel of the TDI material into the vessel's secondary containment.  The containment \r\narea acts to reduce the release rate of TDI to the atmosphere.   The ALOHA model was used to \r\nmodel this release and showed that there would be no off site areas, no Public Receptors, and \r\nno environmental receptors located within the maximum distance endpoint for TDI.  Therefore \r\nNCFI qualifies for Program 1 of RMP.\r\n\r\nThe RMP Submit Program only allows reports of one or more pounds of emissions per minute \r\nto be recorded.  NCFI's actual release rate is only 0.0295 pounds per minute for a total\r\nrelease of only 1.77 pounds for the release duration.  A professional consulting firm\r\nthat specializes in environmental sciences and issues modeled our scenario.\r\n\r\nNCFI has an ongoing program that support the constant process of maintaining, improving, and \r\nre-evaluating our safety, emergency, and operational procedures to insure their effectiveness.  \r\nBy meeting the Program 1 eligibility requirements, NCFI believes that the existing safety \r\nprogram is adequate.  However, if any changes occur in the future that impacts the TDI\r\nprocess, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed and our procedures revised to insure\r\nthat the safety of NCFI's employees and neighbors is not compromised."

      "SummaryText": "RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Foam Industries (NCFI) Division of Barnhardt Manufacturing Company is a \r\nflexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) manufacturer.  Flexible polyurethane foam is primarily used \r\nas a cushioning material in the bedding and furniture industries.\r\n\r\nNCFI receives liquids by truck trailer and rail tank car. The liquids are received and stored\r\nin tanks with secondary containment. The FPUF is manufactured by a process that combines \r\nthese liquids and forms the solid foam through a reaction of the blended liquids on a \r\nmanufacturing process called a pourline.  The foam is then cured, stored, fabricated, and \r\nshipped to supply customer demand.\r\n\r\nOne of the liquids that is a component of the foam process is call toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  \r\nThis is the only material used in a sufficient quantity in a process at NCFI that requires\r\nthis Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nNCFI has a successful accidental release prevention program that is composed of both physical \r\nand procedural elements.  NCFI has maintenance programs that keep all tanks (primary \r\ncontainment) in excellent condition.  Furthermore there is passive secondary (pits and walls \r\nsurrounding the tanks) and active tertiary containment (culvert plugs and gates in drainage \r\nsystem) that will hold materials lost from a catastrophic failure of the primary containment.\r\n\r\nNCFI has spill response programs that are designed to provide materials and procedures to \r\nhandle small incidental releases.  These programs are a material part of the job of personnel \r\nthat are responsible for handling the liquids in our production operation.  There is \r\ndecontaminating solution and absorbent materials readily available in convenient locations \r\nthrough out the areas of the process.  NCFI has developed Emergency Response Procedures \r\nand coordinated these procedures with the City of Mount Airy Fire Department to respond to \r\nany significant releases of TDI. The City of Mount Airy is party to a Mut"
