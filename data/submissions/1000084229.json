The terminal operates 7 days per week and 24 hours per day.  Operational and maintenance personnel constantly monitor and maintain process equipment.  The terminal conducts drills and personal hygiene monitoring to maintain emergency response readiness.  HAT maintains the ongoing integrity of the process equipment through preventive maintenance and inspections.  Strict guidelines have been established, through the Process Safety Management Regulations, to maintain equipment in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nHAT's safety and environmental exemplary record reflects this commitment.

The releases that HAT has had in the past 5 years are typically very small releases in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\n\n\nHAT has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control, and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.  The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from out"

The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\n\n\nAlthough HAT's ERP is specifically written for the HAT facility, the plan is also part of the countywide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\n\n\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, HAT looks continuously for possible operational or administrative changes to improve safety in our facility.  HAT is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  HAT and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense.\n\n\n\nHAT has performed the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) per the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subchapter B.  The Worst-Case Toxic scenario is defined as the total release of one of the bulk anhydrous storage tanks.  EPA's RMP*COMP (web version) was utilized to obtain the predicted radius to the toxic endpoint; however, the program is limited to a release of 7,500,000 pounds for ammonia liquified by refrigeration, which is less than the release scenario of 30,000,000 pounds.  Per guidance from the EPA, the endpoint determination was obtained by specifying that the ammonia was liquified under pressure and specifying a release of 30,000,000 pounds as required.   Population estimates for the OCA were determined using NOAA/EPA MARPLOT software (V"
