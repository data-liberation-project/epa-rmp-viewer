New London submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their New London, Wisconsin facility.  Sara Lee Corporation A? New LondonA?s operations include the processing of meat products (hot dogs, sausages, hams and deli meats) for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names of Hillshire Farm and Deli Select.  Sara Lee Corporation A? New London has been in operation at this facility for over 50 years providing quality meat products and over 1,000 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSara Lee Corporation A? New London is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Sara Lee Corporation A? New LondonA?s policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHAA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nSara Lee Corporation A? New London is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Sara Lee Corporation A? New London uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 500,000 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  \n"

To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sara Lee Corporation A? New London has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\nSara Lee Corporation A? New London maintains a A?no odorA? policy.  The A?no odorA? policy instructs employees that detect an ammonia odor to call the Utilities Maintenance staff and the Utilities Maintenance staff must respond immediately to the call to address the situation.\n\nSara Lee Corporation A? New London has implemented and is in compliance with OSHAA?s PSM regulations and as such, has evaluated and engineered for anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Sara Lee Corporation A? New London has trained approximately 37 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\n\nSara Lee Corporation A? New London has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis by means of a SOP review session.  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed during these annual meetings as well.  Sara Lee Corporation A? New London encourages employee participation in developme"

New London has developed a comprehensive emergency response program designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release.  This program is fully described in a document entitled Emergency Response Plan in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of off-site releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Included in the Emergency Response Plan are measures to be taken internally by Sara Lee Corporation A?

These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHAA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  These personnel receive initial training and annual update training thereafter. Sara Lee Corporation A?
