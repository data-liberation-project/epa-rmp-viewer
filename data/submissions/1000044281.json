This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nQEP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  QEP's Cutthroat B Gas Plant has coordinated with the Pleasant View Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Cutthroat B Gas Plant is located approximately 17.5 miles southwest of the town of Pleasant View, Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of Y Grade natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made of propanes, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons.  Additionally, dehydrated natural gas (methane and ethane) is produced at the facility.  All of these substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  QEP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.4 miles and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant's distance from any public receptors.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Cutthroat B Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable"
