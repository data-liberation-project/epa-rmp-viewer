If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 149,000 pounds in our 3 storage tanks.  In addition to this we have 83,011 pounds of capacity in rolling stock (19 tanks of 1000 gallon water capacity figured at 85%, which is the maximum filled capacity with NH3).\n\nThe worst-case release and alternate scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns and falls under the homeland security act.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61 and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111. OSHA, EPA, DOT and the Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects our facilities on an annual basis. These along with the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safety record. \n\nNote:  As of the date of this submission, the KDA had not adpoted the most current version of ANSI.  When they do we will budget the time and funds needed to make any additional corrections the new rules may require.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant proper damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOur employees routinely inspect the plant for necessary maintenance or improvements.  There are no upgrades or repairs needed at this time. \n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and we report are regulated materials to the Community Right to"
