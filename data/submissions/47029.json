      "SummaryText": "The Mohawk View Water Treatment Plant (MVWTP), located at 100 Onderdonk Avenue in Latham, New York, processes potable water as part of the Latham Water District (Division of Latham Water).  The Latham Water District serves over 76,000 customers as well as numerous industrial and commercial uses.  Three different raw water sources (the Mohawk River, the Stony Creek Reservoir and five wells located on Onderdonk Avenue) are pumped to the MVWTP where chemical and physical treatment occurs.  The MVWTP is permitted to withdraw 6 million gallons per day (MGD) from the Reservoir, up to 27.5 MGD from the Mohawk River, and 7 MGD from the wells.\n\nChemical treatment consists of oxidation, coagulation, chlorination and pH adjustment.  Physical treatment consists of flocculation, settling and filtration.  Finished water is pumped to the distribution system and is stored in eleven storage vessels located throughout the Town.  The chlorine used in the chlorine disinfection system is stored and used in one-ton (2,000 pound) containers.  The MVWTP has the capacity to store up to ten one-ton containers (20,000 pounds) on-site (stored and/or in use).  Six containers are in service in the Scale Room while the others are in storage in the adjacent container storage area.  Thus, the maximum amount of chlorine on-site at the MVWTP exceeds the Accidental Release Prevention rules, codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119, since the maximum amount of chlorine on-site exceeds 1,500 pounds, the MVWTP is subject to the requirements of Process Safety Management (PSM).  It should be noted that, during the last five years, the facility has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine.  It should also be noted that no incidents of an accidental release of chlorine have occurred since the chlorine system was installed at the facility in 1967.\n\nThe original RMP*Submit was submitted for the MVWTP in November 2001.

      "SummaryText": "he facility has since undergone an expansion which added a new treatment area that involved different chemical and physical treatment processes that do not involve additional processes covered by 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility is currently subject to the PSM requirements for the chlorine stored and used at the facility.  In accordance with PSM requirements, the MVWTP is in the process of reviewing the process hazard analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system.  The MVWTP also recently reviewed the components of the Program 3 Prevention Program and is in the process of updating those components as needed.  The MVWTP is committed to continuing to minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases and conducts annual reviews of the chlorine disinfection system operating procedures and completes routine inspections of the chlorine system process equipment at least 4 times per shift, as well as annual inspections of process equipment by outside contractors.  \n\nThe MVWTP is included in the community emergency response plan and employees of the MVWTP receive training in the facility's own emergency response procedures for accidental release of chlorine.  Employees are trained in procedures to ensure the chlorine system is shutdown as appropriate to limit and isolate an accidental release of chlorine, activate ventilation, and summon the appropriate emergency response agencies, and evacuate the affected facility areas in a safe and orderly manner."
