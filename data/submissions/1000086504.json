Stationary Source and Chemical of Concern\n\nThe National Frozen Foods facility is located in Moses Lake, Washington.  The facility processes vegetables using anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. The plant has been operating safely since 2000. The plant has one main refrigeration system; additional refrigeration is supplied when needed from a neighboring facility, Americold. Only the main system contains over the threshold amount of ammonia. The two systems are not connected but are both included in the facility safety program. The reported chemical quantity reflects any ammonia onsite.\n\n\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\n\nThe top priority of National Frozen Foods, Moses Lake facility is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, the facility has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specifi"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program \n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, and orderly evacuation of the facility and coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility is proactive in their approach to health and safety of its employees and surrounding community.
