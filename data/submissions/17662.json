In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws.\n\nHastings Garage, Inc. provides anhydrous ammonia for their customers.  We provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public. To maintain a safe environment we conduct regular safety checks, using checklist survey forms. Hastings Garage, Inc. conducts comprehensive annual audits to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\nHastings Garage, Inc. holds a annual employee training session and review meeting during February.  The training session is followed by a written test. \n\n\nDescription of our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThis facility is a retail farm supply center.  We store and sell a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia (Aqua) is also used for ble"

The maximum quantity released would be 131,000 pounds. According to reference table #22 the distance to the endpoint is .7 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario would be a hose failure.  In this case the emergency valve would automatically close.  This would allow the anhydrous ammonia in the hose to excape. The amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be less than 90 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint  for this scenario is expected to be less than .1 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose "

Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and on the job training.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they all respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirments for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\nIn addition, Hastings Garage, Inc. has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular "
