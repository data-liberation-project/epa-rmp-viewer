The Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the District Safety and Training Officer to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n2.0 Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\n\nProgram Level: 3\n\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine\n\n\n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of the Chlorine from our process.

The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Sangamon County Water Reclamation Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1 Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb.) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Spring Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant Chlorination Process is required by state law, to implement a Program Level 3 Prevention Program which is similar to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program "
