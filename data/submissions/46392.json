This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Manager are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale\u00bfs safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers\u00bf documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n - To save lives.\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n - To protect the environment.\n - To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.

      "SummaryText": "01.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 3800 N. Division Street (State Route 47) in Morris, Illinois, just north of the intersection of the Interstate 80 freeway and Illinois State Route 47.  Morris is located approximately 55 miles southwest of Chicago.  The immediate area is primarily rural with some developed land (the town of Morris) south of Interstate 80.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 30,000 pounds (5,400 gallons) of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for three cold storage areas: Cross Dock (35F), Cooler Storage (28F), and Freezer Storage (-10F).  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver to the high temperature pump accumulator.  The high pressure receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  As the ammonia enters the high temperature pump accumulator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The high temperature pump accumulator feeds a similar vessel that maintains an intermediate pressure, the medium temperature pump accumulator.  The pressure is further reduced"

      "SummaryText": "between the medium temperature accumulator and the low temperature pump accumulator.  Each accumulator vessel supplies pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  The high temperature accumulator serves twenty-six (26) cross dock/cold storage evaporators.  The medium temperature accumulator typically serves eight (8) 28F cooler evaporators (that can also be supplied by the high temperature accumulator as needed), and the low temperature accumulator serves four (4) -10F freezer evaporators.  Fans in each evaporator are used to blow air across and through the coils which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia.\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia from each set of evaporators is returned to each accumulator respectively in which constant pressures (temperatures) are maintained based on the suction pressure of the corresponding compressors.  The vapor from the accumulators is then drawn to eight (8) compressors where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  All eight compressors work in combination to compress the vapor pulled from the three accumulator vessels.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is routed to two (2) condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the high pressure receiver.  Hot gas is also used  for defrost of the freezer and meat evaporators.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the condensers.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example,"

Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (July 2001 - July 2006).

Approximately 17 pounds of ammonia was released due to a material failure of a gasket on a compressor service port.  The leak was investigated, and the appropriate information was filed with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Emergency Response.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Morris Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  Costco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the maintenance manager and the assistant depot managers.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.
