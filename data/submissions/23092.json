Meade Chemical Plant's primary product is phosphoric acid.  It is used as a main ingredient to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by truck or railcar and is stored in a vessel called a bullet.  Ammonia is combined with phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nU.S. Agri-Chemicals' Accidental Release Prevention Program includes:\n\n? Requirement to ensure covered process equipment is properly designed with emergency shutoff\n? Training of maintenance personnel and testing of critical covered process equipment\n? Written operating procedures and training of operators\n? Safety inspections, reviews, and audits of covered process equipment\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNone\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nU.S. Agri-Chemicals' Emergency Response Program includes:\n\n?
