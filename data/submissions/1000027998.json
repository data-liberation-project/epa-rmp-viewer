From the pump, flow is routed to the appropriate well where it passes through the wellhead and into the cavern.  An equivalent volume of brine is displaced out of the well via the wellhead to the brine pit.\r\n\r\nIn the event that brine leaving the storage well may have entrained a small amount of product or salt gas, the brine stream from the well is routed through a separator which removes any entrained LPG product.  That small amount of product or salt gas is routed to the flare for disposal and the brine is routed to the brine pit where it is held for future use.  Under normal operation, LPG is not entrained in the brine stream, but under unusual conditions, such as when the interface reaches a weep hole, such entrainment can occur.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProduct Removal - Product is removed from storage well by routing brine into the well.

      "SummaryText": "of the brine flowing into the storage well acts on the product in the well to displace product out of the well and, in most cases, imparts enough energy to the product-out stream to meet the distribution pipeline pressure requirements.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that under most operating conditions, the weight difference between brine and product develops sufficient pressure for proper well operation, including distribution pipeline pressure requirements.  The brine pumps are not usually required to actually produce pressure in the well.  They simply move brine to the well and gravity, acting through the brine/product weight differential, produces the required pressure.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tMetering, Monitoring, and Control - All products flowing into and out of storage wells is metered to determine well inventory and monitor the volume being moved.  Temperatures, pressures, and flows of all streams are monitored and recorded in the control room.  Each wellhead trip system is designed such that each cavity is individually protected against under pressure, overpressure, and overfilling.  Operation control of the product and brine pipeline streams is maintained from the control room as well.\r\n\r\n \r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a near-miss reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\r\n\r\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded t"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Almeda Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Enterprise Almeda Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Almeda Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Almeda Terminal conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Almeda Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Almeda Terminal uses Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented to ensure that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change.  Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Almeda Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
