This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substance, ammonia. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to coordinate with professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan provides the response organization with notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to effectively respond to emergency situations that may arise at the facility\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary business of FreshPoint Southern California is the storage and distribution of refrigerated food products. Located approximately 25 miles east of Highway 605, approximately 1.9 miles south of Highway 10 and 1.9 miles north of Highway 60.  We maintain one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is approximately 10,700 pounds.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, FreshPoint Southern California operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CaIARP) Program, CalOSHA PSM Program, and EPA RMP Program. \n\n\n\nThe facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include an Ammonia Dispersion Tank and ammonia sensors near the evaporators and inside the Engine Room. The compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits. Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled. Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over pressurization and are commonly piped to the Ammonia Dispersion"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nFreshPoint Southern California has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nFreshPoint Southern California carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at FreshPoint Southern California to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\n\n\nFreshPoint Southern California conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nFreshPoint Southern California promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nFreshPoint Southern California believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\n\n\nOn occasion, FreshPoint Southern California hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

The release occurred on November 4, 2010.  The ammonia leak was caused by a defective seal within the valve system at valve station #13.  The total amount of ammonia released was less than five pounds of ammonia.  No injuries resulted from this release.  All valve seals were replaced to prevent additional leaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Action Plan:\n\n\n\nFreshPoint Southern California is included in the written community emergency response plan. This facility has its own emergency action plan. The emergency action plan includes specific actions to be taken in action to accidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release and information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures.
