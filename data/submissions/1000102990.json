The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n*save lives;\n*minimize and avoid injuries;\n*protect the environment; and\n*minimize property damage.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chemical health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to react effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the RMP regulations. \n\nIrwindale Brew Yard personnel will circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that a chlorine leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the EHS Manager.  The EHS Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe IRWINDALE BREW YARD, LLC is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the IRWINDALE BREW YARD, LLC to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of IRWINDALE BREW YARD, LLC employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.
