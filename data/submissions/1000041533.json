The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN  PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2.

The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nA five-year accident history has not been prepared and included in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) since the facility is new. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6.

MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7.
