      "SummaryText": "FMC Corporation's Lithium Division facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFMC Corporation's Lithium Division facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina (\"FMC\") is committed to\nconducting its business in a manner that protects the safety and health of its employees, contractors,\nand neighbors.  This committment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention,\ntraining, and the highest regard for safety throughout facility design, installation, operation and maintenance.  Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.   Trained emergency response personnel work with local response agencies to control emergencies and protect public safety.\n\nII. Source Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe FMC Bessemer City facility manufacturers and processes organic and inorganic lithium compounds.  Methyl chloride, an RMP regulated substance, is used as a reactant to manufacture methyllithium.  Methyllithium is produced for the pharmaceutical industry which uses it to manufacture pharmaceutical products. While methyl chloride is a gas at ambient conditions, it is shipped and handled as a compressed liquid.  Methyl chloride is considered toxic at concentrations of 400 ppm (0.04% in air) or greater and is very flammable. \n\nIII. Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for methyl chloride is the release of all 16,000 lbs stored on site over a ten (10) minute period, during a time of stable atmospheric conditions and a very slow wind of ~3 mph.  These conditions would keep the vapor in a cloud and minimize the gas from dispersing and becoming  less concentrated.   Under these conditions,  methyl chloride concentrations at 400 ppm or greater could occur up to 0.8 miles from the release.  If a circle were drawn around the storage tank, reaching 0.8 miles in all directions, approximately 170 homes in our community could be affected. "

      "SummaryText": " Part of the Bessemer City Middle School lies at the boundary of that circle.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is highly unlikely to occur given the safety and prevention programs in place.  A more credible scenario (which is considered as the alternative case)  is if the hose from a trailer loading methyl chloride into the storage tank were to leak.  In this case, it is estimated that about 800 lbs of methyl chloride could be lost and methyl chloride concentrations of 400 ppm or greater could occur up to 0.1 miles from the release.  This release scenario would just barely leave our property and affect only one of our neighbors and the Amercian Legion Hall, if the wind were blowing in their direction.  To prevent releases during transfer, FMC's operating procedures require that the transfer line be inspected prior to connection and after they are connected, they are pressure tested with inert nitrogen gas to ensure they aren't leaking.\n\nIV. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nExtensive process safety analyses have been conducted to identify potential hazards in the methyllithium process and mechanisms to prevent releases have been implemented.  Experts have been consulted and used in the design of FMC's methyllithium process to ensure that process safety systems protect our employees and neighbors.  Operating procedures have been developed, reviewed and operators are trained on routine operations as well as process startup, shutdown, and safety and emergency systems.   Methyl chloride is only stored at FMC when we are making methyllithium for a specific customer order.  Only the amount of methyl chloride which will be needed to fill current orders is brought on site.\n\nV. Five year Accident History\n\nFMC has not had a methyl chloride release in the past five years. \n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nFMC's emergency response program includes a general plantwide program to be implemented in the event of an emergency as well as specific  "
