KFE's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKFE produces anhydrous ammonia, urea fertilizer, and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is also injected into a pipeline to be transported to distribution terminals. \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of two ammonia units, two urea production units, and a UAN unit.  Ancillary units include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station and a hydrogen recovery unit (HRU).  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer in the urea production units.  Urea Formaldehyde is injected into the process to produce granulated urea.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.   \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (chlorine is used as a water treatment chemical in cooling towers and tertiary water t"

An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThis RMP Update is being submitted by KFE voluntarily due to the addition of a second Urea Unit (UR2).  The update requirements found at 40 CFR 68.190(b) do not accurately represent the circumstances of this change; that is, the existing PHA was not revised, the offsite consequence analysis (worst case and alternative release scenarios) did not change, there was no change to program level, and no additional RMP-regulated chemicals were introduced.  All nine sections of the RMP are being updated for this submittal.  This submittal also includes a change in the emergency contact information.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KFE.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n-    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n-    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nKFE is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program has involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility incl"

They occurred in December 2013 and March 2014.  Additional information for each incident is provided in the RMP Data Elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for KFE with the Enid Fire Department, the Garfield County Sheriff, and the Garfield County LEPC.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Oklahoma State Police, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, and St. Mary's Regional Medical Center.  The KFE Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan h"

The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\n\n-    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n-    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n-    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n-    Incident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective measures are taken, if necessary, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Internal and third party compliance audits to ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\n-    An ongoing dialogue with the Garfield County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops. \n\n\n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Garfield County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency respo"
