We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.   This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including a description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation, an overview of our accidental release prevention programs, a five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA?s RMP Rule, an overview of our emergency response program, an overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment, the certification that EPA?s RMP program requires us to provide, and the data elements about our risk management program.\n\n2.0   STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility manufactures fine organic chemicals.  These chemicals are primarily used as intermediate and active ingredients in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products.  This facility is a multi-purpose, batch chemical processing plant that typically runs numerous different chemical processes per year on a campaign basis.  Various process equipment,  including reactors, centrifuges complete with sumps, dryers, vacuum pumps, and condensers are used to manufacture these products.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:  anhydrous ammonia.  Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including process safety information, process hazard analyses, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup reviews, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor training.  These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.0   FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental releases that occur at our facility.  There have been no chemical releases from processes covered under EPA?s RMP rule in the last five years.\n\n6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n7.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll process equipment tha"
