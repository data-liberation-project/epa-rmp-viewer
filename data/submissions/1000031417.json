If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n 2. Facility Information\n\n\n\n    - The primary activity at Harvest Land is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n \n\n    - Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n    - The maximum quantity stored would be 334,000 pounds which would include two storage tanks, 26,000 and 30,000 gallons, plus all rolling stock filled to 85% of volume available. The maximum quantity handled at any one time would be the same as the maximum quantity stored, 334,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n 3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n\n\n     a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 1.12 miles.\n\n\n\n     b. The alternate release scenario is based on a 2 minute release from the break in a 3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint is 0.78 miles.\n\n\n\n 4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n     Harvest Land has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational S"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that\n\n      -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n\n\n      -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n 6. The emergency response program.\n\n\n\n     -Harvest Land has\n\n\n\n     a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n\n\n     b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n     c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n 7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at these  time.    \n\n\n\n       \n\n                                                              Aaron Guggisberg\n\n                                                              Safety Director"
