Badger Filtration Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination Process.  Santa Fe Irrigation District \u00c2\u00bf R.E. Badger Filtration Plant policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Santa Fe Irrigation employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas.  The chlorination system consists of a gaseous chlorine storage and feed system.  The gaseous chlorine is housed in the chlorine storage room.  The storage room contains eight scales, each configured with four one-ton chlorine cylinders, for a total of eight one-ton cylinders.  However, only four cylinders are utilized simultaneously, while the additional four are on stand-by.  Additionally, unconnected cylinders are stored on trunnions within the storage room.  Thus, a total of up to eight gaseous chlorine one-ton cylinders are located on site at any given time.\nThe aqueous ammonia system consists of a liquid storage tank outfitted with p"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed; this includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  The Chlorine Prevention Program 3 elements include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permit\nContractors\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Program 2 elements include:\nSafety Information\nHazard Review\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMaintenance\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no chlorine or aqueous ammonia releases within the last five years.  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThe facility has filed a Unified Contingency Plan with San Diego County Department of Environmental Health and this plan includes:\nEmergency Alarm Procedures\nEvacuation Procedures\nSafety and Health Considerations\nNotification Procedures\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Hazard Review, and Seismic Assessment have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the reports.  Any outstanding recommendations will have been addressed by December 30, 2009.  \nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\nThe use of flammable materials at the Santa Fe Irrigation District \u00c2\u00bf R.E Badger Filtration Plant is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNA"

Rather than using a metering pump, compressed air is supplied to the storage tank to maintain a slight positive pressure.  The aqueous ammonia is then fed at a small rate to the T.M. Vault Drip Line, F.M. Chamber Drip Line, and FCW Drip Line.\n \nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined for each covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook.  \nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\nScenario Description: Two alternative case release scenarios were modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook. \nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance:\nThe system has alarms and interlocks\nThe system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\nGas detection i"
