              "Description": "The alkylated formaldehyde resins process is a batch process carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor).  The reactor can be water cooled or steam heated to control the reaction rate.  The reactors are equipped with overhead reflux condensers to condense the unreacted overhead vapors and to return them to the reactor.  The reactor is equipped with safety relief devices, either safety relief valves or rupture discs or both, to prevent overpressurization of the reactor that could cause a catastrophic release of toxic chemicals.  The reactors are also vented to the plant absorber systems or flare or both to minimize release of toxic chemicals to the atmosphere whenloading or depressurizing the reactor.                                                                      The listed chemical for this process is a 37% formaldehyde in water solution (formalin).  The largest quantity of this chemical on site is the storage tank.  The formalin storage tank is a carbon steel, vertical, atmospheric storage tank.  The tank and piping are visually checked for corrosion on an annual basis.  Since this tank is an atmospheric tank and the formalin vapor pressure is low, there is virtually no chance of over pressurization and catastrophic failure of this tank.  The formalin in the storage tank is replenished by tank truck deliveries.  Formalin deliveries are scheduled on an as needed basis to prevent overfilling of the tank.                          The formalin is transferred by pipe from the storage tank to the reactor.  Check valves are installed in the piping to prevent backflow and possible contamination of the storage tank or overflow from the tank.  The formalin feed rate is controlled to control the reaction and temperature and pressure in the reactor.  A maintenance program is in place to inspect the piping, pumps, reactor, and process vessels and to make appropriate repairs as soon as possible if a problem is discovered.                                        A formal operator training process is in place to instruct and review the procedures necessary for the safe operation of the process.  The operators and supervisors are trained in the execution of the written emergency response plan.",

              "Description": "The two listed chemicals for this process are ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO).                                                                        The oxyalkylated products process, like all of the other processes on site, is a batch process carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor).  The reactor is protected from a catastrophic failure caused by overpressurization by the installation of safety relief devices.  The reactor pressure is also controlled by the controlled addition  of EO or PO and by the reactor cooling jacket.  The reactors are vented through a vent condenser to a flare to minimize emissions of EO and PO to the atmosphere.  Destruction efficiency of the flare is greater than 98%.                                                                                                                 The largest quantity of EO or PO on site is located in their respective storage vessels.  These storage tanks are horizontal pressure vessels rated at 250 psig.  They are equipped with safety relief devices to prevent a catastrophic release of EO or PO as a result of tank overpressurization.  The EO and PO in the tanks are blanketed with nitrogen to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the tanks.  The nitrogen pressure does not exceed 75 psig, which is well below the 250 psig pressure rating of the tanks.  No- leak design, canned pumps are used to transfer the EO or PO from the storage tank to the reactor.  The transfer lines contain check valves that prevent reverse flow from the reactor to the storage tanks to prevent contamination and/or overpressurization of the storage tanks.  The storage tanks and piping are thickness and corrosion checked every three years by an outside contractor to insure mechanical integrity.  The EO and PO storage tanks are loaded by railroad tank car.  A vapor recycle system is used to recycle the vapor from the storage tank to the railcar while the liquid EO or PO is pumped into the storage tank.  This system prevents venting of EO or PO to the atmosphere.    All operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of EO and PO and in emergency response prodedures.                                                       A written maintenance program is used to insure inspection and timely correction of any leaks that might develop in the process.",

              "Description": "Like all of the other processes on site, the esterification process is a batch process utilizing a jacketed, stirred tank, pressurized vessel (reactor).  All safety devices described on the other batch reactors apply to this reaction system.  Safety relief devices protect the reactors from catastrophic failure caused by overpressurization.  These reactors vent through a condenser to an acid/base absorber/scrubber system and a final activated carbon bed or to the flare to minimize harmful emissions to the atmosphere.                                                                                                  The listed chemicals for this process are anhydrous ammonia and acetaldehyde.  The largest quantity of ammonia on site is contained in a horizontal, 250 psig pressure rated, storage tank.  The acetaldehyde is received in the trailer tank.  The trailer tank contains enough acetaldehyde for 24 batch reactor runs and is removed from the site at the completion of this approximately two and one half hour production run.  A maximum of only two runs per week is made, with a maximum of 24 runs per year.  Acetaldehyde is not stored on site.  The trailer tank is DOT rated and inspected for the safe transportation and storage of  acealdhyde .              Both the trailer tank and ammonia storage tank are protected by safety relief devices to prevent rupture by overpressurization.  When on site, the acetaldehyde trailer is within ten feet of the batch reactor.  Excess acetaldehyde is vented through the reactor to the flare via the plant scrubber system.  The trailer tank has an excess flow valve.  The ammonia storage tank  is loaded from a delivery tank truck  using a closed, vapor recycle system to prevent emissions of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The ammonia tank also has an excess flow valve that will shut down the flow of ammonia within one minute in case of a line leak or excessive flow to the reactor.                                                                                                 The ammonia tank is inspected for corrosion and wall thickness every three years by an outside contractor to insure the tank integrity.  Like the other processes, a maintenance plan is enforced to maintain mechanical integrity of the process.                All operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of ammonia and acetaldehyde.  They are also required to attend monthly safety meetings.                                                                              As at all of Champion Technologies' sites, the operators and supervisors are instructed in the following major areas:  a)  Overview of RCRA rules and regulations;  b)  Emergency Response and Spill Prevention;  c)  Right-To-Know laws;  d)  Use of safety equipment;  e)  Job specific training;  f)  Chemical safety training;  g)  Respiratory protection;  and h)  Confined Space Entry procedures.  A full file of material safety data sheets (MSDS), readily available to both the employees and the public, are located at each of Champion Technologies' sites.",
