      "SummaryText": "Aon Energy Risk Engineering (AERE), a subsidiary of Aon Fire Protection Engineering Corporation,performed Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) study for the EPA Risk Management Program(RMP) of the Phillips 66 Denver Terminal facility in Commerce City, Colorado. Phillips 66 will be unloading tanker cars of butane into storage for use in gasoline blending downstream. This consequence analysis was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Rule, 40 CFR, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program: Risk Management Programs (RMP). This rule requires that both worst-case and alternative release scenarios be developed for all toxic and flammable materials handled,manufactured, used, or stored at the facility that are at or above the threshold quantity in a covered process. Butane is the only material located at this facility that is above threshold quantities in a covered process. Butane is listed in the RMP rule as a flammable material.    Conclusions are summarized below:\r\n\u00bfh- The flammable Worst Case Scenario (WCS) was determined to be the complete and immediate\r\nfailure of one of the 517 bbls storage bullets. Vessel V-7 is the bullet located closest to a public receptor. The distance to the flammable worst-case endpoint was found to be 0.4 miles. There were 2 housing units with a population of 4 people, and commercial, office and industrial businesses within the radius of this endpoint.\r\n\u00bfh- The alternate release scenario was selected to be a development of a 2 inch hole in the bottom of storage bullet V-7. While there is an active mitigation system of an automatically triggered fire deluge system based on heat detection with cross zone detection to activate the fire suppression, the endpoint for an unmitigated release was the same distance as a release mitigated at 10 minutes by the deluge system. The distance to ARS LFL endpoint of 1.5E4 ppm was found to be 616 feet. There are commercial, office"
