We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Conroe believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Conroe has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Southwest Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.   All chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are stored and utilized within separate buildings.  The buildings will act as passive mitigation in the event of a release.\n\nCh"

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n    Worst-Case Scenario    Alternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)    1.5    3\nAtmospheric Stability Class    F    D\nTemperature (0 F)    104    104\nHumidity (%)    50    50\nHeight of Release (m)    0    1\nSurface Roughness    1    1\n    Chlorine    Sulfur Dioxide\nEnd Points    0.0087    0.0078\n\nThe results of the air dispersion model are summarized in the table below along with the estimated population within the impact area. The population data was estimated using the Block Uniform Density Group Method in Landview III.  The public and environmental receptors are listed in Section 8 of this plan.\n\nSLAB Output Results\n    Worst-Case Scenario    Alternative Scenario\n    Chlorine    Sulfur Dioxide    Chlorine    Sulfur Dioxide\nImpact Radius (miles)    1    0.9    0.45    0.4\nEstimated Population with Impact Area    240    240    56    56\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Conroe has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.  This Program includes:  safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n"

It is Conroe's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  With this in mind, Conroe is planning on incorporating many of the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the plant."
