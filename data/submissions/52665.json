      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Stack Metallurgical Services, Inc. include the follow.\n\nStack Metallurgical Services, Inc. uses anhydrous ammonia in two process; which if released could result in a serious situation. In the past our plant maintained a Hazardous Materials Response team under OSHA requirements found in Emergency response to hazardous substance releases (1910.120(q)). Because the size of our facility and staff it is very difficult to maintain a full Hazmat Team in terms of the number of staff and training. These same regulations provide an employer an option to evacuate their employees if there is a hazardous release and use outside public and private Hazmat Teams to control and migrate the release. This requires that Stack have a basic Emergency Action Plan that meets Oregon OSHA rule 437-002-0042. We have decided to protect our employees from danger by maintaining the ammonia systems preventing releases and if there is a release evacuating our employees out of the danger areas. Further, our employees will not assist in handling the emergency within the release zones. Our employees would provide accurate information about our systems to outside trained Hazmat Responders.\n\nOur plan provide the following Emergency Action Plan elements:\n\n1. Procedures for reporting emergencies to outside responders and our neighbors if needed.\n2. Names/Job Titles of our staff responsible for the emplementation of the plan and who to contact for more information about the duties of employees under the plan.\n3. Procedures for emergency evacuation including the type of evacuation and exit routes.\n4. Description of our alarm systems for emergencies inclusing the ammonia sensor alarm system.\n5. Procedures to follow for emergency operation or shut down of critical equipment before evacuation.\n6. Procedures to account for all employees after evacuation.\n7. Procedures to follow for rescue and medical assistance.\n8. Plant employee training out"
