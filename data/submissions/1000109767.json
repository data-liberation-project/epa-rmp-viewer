The plan consists of procedures for\nresponding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. \n\nIn addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual plant emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. The EARP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ONEOK Rockies Midstream facilities. The EARP program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Demicks Lake Gas Plant has been coordinated with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The local responders for plant emergencies are the Watford Fire Department and the McKenzie County Sheriff Department. The Demicks Lake Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Demicks Lake Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

(ORM)\nDEMICKS LAKE GAS PLANT\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant (Facility/Plant) has a commitment to worker and public safety. This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. ONEOK Rockies Midstream, LLC (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant, located near Keene, North Dakota is a three train 600 MMscfd gas processing plant using mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, pentane, and gas condensate). The Demicks Lake Gas Plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Demicks Lake Gas Plant is regulated by the Environmental"
