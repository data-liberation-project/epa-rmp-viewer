This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Lebanon County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nFarmers Pride considers protecting the health and well-being of our team members to be of the utmost importance. It is in this spirit that we devote great efforts to our health and safety programs. Priorities are placed on adherence to the occupational health and safety act along with hazard recognition and elimination. Team members are encouraged to always work safely and immediately report any unsafe condition to management. Through active discussion and participation we will, together, enjoy a safe work environment.\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Farmer's Pride, Inc., operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Farmer's Pride, Inc. is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the dist"

      "SummaryText": "ances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Farmer's Pride RMP Plan on file at the facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of data from the 2010 US Census Bureau in CAPS, Circular Area Profiling System and Google Maps mapping system software.\n\n\n\n- General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nFarmer's Pride, Inc., has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Farmer's Pride, Inc.,  has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\n- Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the Farmer's Pride, Inc., facility. \n\n \n\n\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nFarmer's Pride, Inc. current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. \n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nFarmer's Pride, Inc., currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Farmer's Pride, Inc., personnel will also periodically review all potential opportu"
