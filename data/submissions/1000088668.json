This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Lebanon County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\r\n\r\nFarmers Pride considers protecting the health and well-being of our team members to be of the utmost importance. It is in this spirit that we devote great efforts to our health and safety programs. Priorities are placed on adherence to the occupational health and safety act along with hazard recognition and elimination. Team members are encouraged to always work safely and immediately report any unsafe condition to management. Through active discussion and participation we will, together, enjoy a safe work environment.\r\n\r\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Farmer's Pride, Inc., operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Farmer's Pride, Inc. is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the dist"
