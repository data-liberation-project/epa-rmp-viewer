      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction\nAs part of a continuing pollution control effort, the New Madrid Power Plant (NMPP), whose sole activity is to generate electricity, is installing a selective catalytic reduction unit to reduce NOx emissions.  This system requires approximately 3585 pounds anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) per hour. On-site storage of anhydrous ammonia will total no more than 1,050,000 pounds, stored in three tanks.  NMPP maintains a multi-faceted safety program; this program includes employee training in both operations and maintenance and emergency response.  Comprehensive manuals have been assembled to provide information and guidance in the area of chemical properties and accidental release prevention/response of all on-site hazardous substances.   Policies are in effect which mandate the continued training and development of existing emergency response (ER) teams.  Safety programs are regularly updated, and staff are actively involved with the (Bootheel) LEPC.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nWorst case scenario:\n- failure of 3 x 400,000 pound storage tanks\n- each bullet is limited by design to no more than 85% fill\n- location S half of plant\n- an instantaneous release of entire contents of one or more storage tanks into diked area\n- passive mitigation (dike) is used\n- distance to toxic endpoint is 2.10 miles (ALOHA)\n\nAlternate scenario:\n- failure of a transfer line (drive-away)\n- location is between tanks and SCR, open directly to atmosphere\n- release is instantaneous\n- excess flow shutoff valves on the bullets and tanker are used as active mitigation devices\n- distance to toxic endpoint is 0.22 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nNew Madrid Power Plant is in compliance with PSM and RMP.  Comprehensive prevention and emergency response procedures are in place regarding the ammonia storage process.  Numerous spill-prevention techniques, including SPCC, HSMP are utilized in this process.  Employees involved with this process are knowledg"

      "SummaryText": "eable and trained in the relationship certain environmental conditions may have on the ammonia storage process.  \n\nEmergency Response\nResponse procedures have been implemented for specific incidents including unloading, storage and use.   Employees are trained as First Responders at awareness level, operations level, technician level or on-the-scene incident commander level.  Emergency response plans are coordinated with the (Bootheel) LEPC, and joint training has been conducted with the LEPC.  Comprehensive training in the area of emergency response is an ongoing effort, and is organized and managed through the efforts of the Principal Environmental Coordinator, NMPP.  Communication and continued development is facilitated by the organization of independent subcommittees formed of emergency response team members.  These subcommittees are charged with encouraging members to submit ideas concerning ways to improve response efforts.  The long-standing allocation of resources to emergency response (ER) illustrates the facility-wide dedication to these ER teams.  Continued ER training and development will ensure that NMPP will maintain the high standards they have achieved.  \n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this RMP there have been no accidental release events that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damages (40 CFR 68.42(a)) at the New Madrid Power Plant."
