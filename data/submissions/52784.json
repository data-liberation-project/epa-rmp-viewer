      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to meet the requirements of Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 40 Part 68.\n\nStationary Source and Chemical of Concern\nThe Twin City Foods Ellensburg facility is located in Ellensburg, Washington.  The facility processes and stores frozen vegetables using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The plant has been operating safely since 1960. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the largest vessel in the system fails catastrophically, releasing its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The release is modeled using RMP*Comp\u00bf software. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan.  In this scenario, a condenser tube develops a crack, releasing ammonia gas to the atmosphere.  No mitigation is considered in the scenario calculations as the release occurs outdoors.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities May 2004, appendix to General Risk Management Program Guidance April 2004, and verified with RMP*Comp\u00bf software.\n\nRelease Prevention Program \nTwin City Foods implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard"

      "SummaryText": "(29 CFR 1910.119 and WAC 296-67), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, and leak detectors.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Twin City Foods Ellensburg facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.119 and WAC 296-824-100 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel."
