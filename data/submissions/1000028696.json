This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Bluestone Gas Plant facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up-to-date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent check-and-balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set. \n\n\n\nKeystone utilizes a contract operating company, Kahuna Operations Management, to operate and maintain the Bluestone Gas Plant, as well as the Sarsen Gas Plant and the Voll Compressor Station (both located in Butler County, where the Bluestone Gas Plant is located).  The same group of employees are responsible for operation of all three facilities, and are based at the Bluestone Gas Plant.  \n\n\n\nThe plant is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility.  The facility includes three 60,000 gallon NGL storage tanks and two 60,000 gallon propane tanks.  NGL is a regulated substance consisting of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and C6+ products.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the regulation.  The worst case scenario (described in the RMP submittal) is the loss of the entire contents of the largest vessel, with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  An alternative release is the loss of NGL due to a hose break durin"

We have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Butler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n  \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Bluestone Gas Processing Plant (Bluestone).  Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the company's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Bluestone strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, Hazard Communications, and other training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHS, those in charge or training, contractors, those conducting pre-star"

Bluestone keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Bluestone has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at lease every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Bluestone maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annual reviewed by management as current and accurate.  "

New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Bluestone uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods for increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points. \n\n\n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Bluestone Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly impl"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices:  Bluestone has long standing safe work practices in place to elp ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exist of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change:  Bluestone has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change.
