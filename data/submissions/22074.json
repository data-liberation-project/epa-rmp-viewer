      "SummaryText": "1.  General accidental release and prevention policy of Roger Woods Foods.\n\nIn this processed meats manufacturing facility we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during its use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is our policy at Roger Woods Foods to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by.  The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia.  Our plant personnel have been trained on teh equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Sationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nRoger Woods Foods, 7 Alfred Street, Savannah Georgia is responsible for the manufacturing of various meat products.  Roger Woods Foods is located in an industrial area of suburban Savannah.  In addition to our facility, the surrounding community houses other commercial businesses as well as residential areas.  There are approximately ___ employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  The manufacturing facility receives and distributes shipments of frozen and refrigerated food products via tractor trailers approximately 8 hours a day, five days a week.\n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the facility is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia, in a liquid and vapor physical state, is the chemical used in the refrigeration process.  The potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment f"

Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks.  Risks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat.  The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  Ammonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn, but only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source. \n\nThe normal inventory level of ammonia that is used during the refrigeration process at the Roger Woods Foods facility is ______ pounds.\n\n3.  Worst case and alternate case release scenarios including administrative and engineering controls to limit/prevent accidental release.\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) located outside the plant main machine room.  This vessel's normal operating level is 6,500 pounds of liquid ammonia, approximately 50% of its total capacity.  Although the high pressure receiver is capable of holding 13,000 pounds, this far exceeds company policy and engineering controls which limits the liquid level to a maximum of 80% at any time.  Considering the \"catastrophic\" possibility does exist for this vessel to release its entire contents, engineering controls incorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release.\n\n                       Worst case release scenario criteria for Roger Woods Foods facility:\n\n                       Ammonia Quantity:                                   5,716 pounds\n                       Rate of Release:                                      489 lbs / min (10 min. release)\n                       LOC (Level of Concern):                     "
