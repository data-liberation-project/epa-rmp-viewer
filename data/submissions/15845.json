The worst case scenarios involve the release of the entire contents of the largest tank of anhydrous ammonia or liquid propane tank.  The alternative scenario for anhydrous ammonia involve a nurse tank hose rupturing.  The alternative scenario for liquid propane gas involves a transfer hose rupturing.  This planning was aided by RMPComp, a program designed by the EPA that provides conservative results. The population within a radius supplied by each scenario could be effected in the remote chance of a release occuring.      (d) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.      The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Brentford, SD facility's anhydrous accidental release prevention program complies with the Environmental Protection Agency accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Adminsitrations (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,  American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards and regulations. The facility's liquified propane gas accidental release prevention program complies with the Environmental Protection Agency accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 Liquid Propane Gas Storage and Handling, ASTM, ANSI, and ASME standards and regulations    (e) The five year accident history.

      "SummaryText": "The following executive summary was prepared in accordance with 68.155 by the owner/operator of the South Dakota Wheat Growers Association - Brentford, SD  Facility #05.   (a)  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.  The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association management and employees of the Brentford, SD facility have implemented a variety of standard operating procedures, safe work practices, training programs, and maintenance procedures designed to protect people, property and the environment.  The facility complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) - 58 requirements for Liquid Propane Gas Storage and Handling, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency accidental release, it is the policy of the management of the Brentford, SD facility to notify the City of Brentford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.  (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Brentford, SD facility stores and handles a variety of products and commodities associated with the production of crops.
