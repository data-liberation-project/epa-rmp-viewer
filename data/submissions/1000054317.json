The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 4707 Twin Cities Road in Elk Grove, California (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into nurse tanks.  There are 19 nurse tanks each with a 1,000-gallon capacity containing anhydrous ammonia that can be present at the facility.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  Wilbur-Ellis is subject to OSHA PSM for anhydrous ammonia; therefore, Program 3 requirements are applicable to the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nTher"

      "SummaryText": "e is one 15,000-gallon aqueous ammonia storage tank and one 2,000-gallon aqueous ammonia tanker truck located at the facility.  The aqueous ammonia (24.5% in solution) is transferred from the storage tanks to tankers supplied by customers and immediately removed from the facility.  The contents of the tankers are sold to the local farming community for use as a fertilizer.  Wilbur-Ellis is not subject to OSHA PSM for aqueous ammonia and satisfies RMP regulations for Program 2 requirements.  \n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is also a retailer of pesticides. The facility sells pesticides in liquid and dry forms for agricultural applications.  Dimethoate (5 gallon containers), oxamyl (5 gallon containers), paraquat dichloride (5 gallon containers), and phorate (40 pound bags) are stored in the warehouse.  For the pesticides, Wilbur-Ellis is eligible for Program 1 under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by CalARP and Federal Risk Management Program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of ammonia, dimethoate, oxamyl, paraquat dichloride, and phorate that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure "

      "SummaryText": "relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia, dimethoate, oxamyl, paraquat dichloride, and phorate in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Sacramento County Fire Department (\"fire department\") and Sacramento Environmental Management District regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia and regulated substances.  In compliance with 2765.1, the facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Reposition existing emergency shut off cable for anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n2.    Evaluate installation of remote-activated emergency shutdown system for anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n3.    Evaluate buoyancy for anhydrous ammonia storage tank and associated foundation with respect to potential flooding.\n\n4.    Update seismic evaluation for ammonia storage tanks.\n\n5.    Adding bollard or k-rail to the eastern end of the anhydrous ammonia tank.\n\n6."
