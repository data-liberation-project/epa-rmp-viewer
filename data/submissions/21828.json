      "SummaryText": "Shawnee Milling Company operates rural feed stores offering anhydrous ammonia to local farmers.  Onsite storage and dispensing of this toxic chemical varies in quantities based on seasonal application demand.  For approximately 3-4 months of the year, maximum quantities of anhydrous ammonia is reduced to less than 20% (35,000 pounds) of the maximum quantity of 175,000 pounds held in storage.\n\nThe company ensures that tanks and components are regularly maintained by qualified contractors.  This facility is regularly inspected by both employees, it's insurance carrier, and the State of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility would have a maximum of 175,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia onsite at its peak sales periods.  Administrative operating procedures limit storage to 85% of its tank's capacity.\n\nStorage tank and system components are replaced on a regular basis by qualified staff or contractors.\n\nThe worst case scenario is structural damage to the bulk storage tank containing, at peak operating periods, up to 175,000 pounds of NH3.  Failure would result in a near-full release of ammonia within 10 minutes in a rural environment.  The toxic endpoint has been calculated to be 8 miles from the tank at which point it would be dispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Public receptors only include residences.  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe more probable alternative accidental release would involve a ruptured disk or relief valve failure that could potentially result in up to 200 pounds release of anhydrous ammonia before an emergency shutoff valve was activated.  The toxic endpoint would be limited to 0.3 miles which would expose a very few residences and no other commerical or public facilities.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.\n\nThis facility follows the emergency response plan established by the Canadian County LEPC and coordinated with the Okarch"
