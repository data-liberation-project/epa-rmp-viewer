      "SummaryText": "Irving Oil Terminals Inc. dba Irving Energy certifies that this facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Fairfield and Benton Fire Rescue Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The facility does not have an on-site fire brigade. Employees are trained to fight incipient-stage fires only and then evacuate and assist the local fire department with propane technical knowledge and assistance. This facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG primarily for distribution direct to our wholesale and retail customers via bobtail delivery. The employees at this site are primarily service, delivery and administration. The facility consists of one 30,000 gallon LPG tank. Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (80%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. This facility complies with applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. The site has never had an accident at this location involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Fairfield and Benton Fire Rescue Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. Irving has trained Propane Emergency Responders within the company that can provide technical assistance to the Incident Commander. Irving has coordinated our response plans with the fire department, and they have reviewed and approved a fire safety analysis for the site."
