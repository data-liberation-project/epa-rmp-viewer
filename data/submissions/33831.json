The WWT Division in conjunction with the Dothan Fire Department conducts an annual chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak drill at one of the facilities.  This is a full scale drill simulating a cylinder rupture with injuries and simulating evacuation procedures.\n\nThe WWT Division has three wastewater treatment plants that store chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas in one ton containers used for disinfection of treated wastewater.  The quantities stored at each facility is as follows: Little Choctawhatchee-6,000 lbs. chlorine and 6,000 lbs. sulfur dioxide; Beaver Creek 6,000 lbs.chlorine and 6,000 lbs. sulfurdioxide; Omussee Creek 10,000 lbs. chlorine and 8,000 lbs. sulfur dioxide.  The total amount stored at all of the wastewater treatment plants is 24,000 lbs. chlorine and 20,000 lbs. sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst case scenario for all three wastewater treatments would result in a maximum threat zone for sulfur dioxide of 3.2 miles.  Based on the 2000 census, this release will affect a residential population of 6,400 from Little Choctawhatchee, 21,000 from Beaver Creek, and 5,200 from Omussee Creek.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide will affect a residential population of 4,300 form Little Choctawhatchee, 14, 000 from Beaver Creek, and 2,700 from Omussee Creek within 2.6 miles.  The alternate release scenario for chlorine will affect a residential population of 3,500 from Little Choctawhatchee, 12,500 from Beaver Creek, and 2,300 from Omussee Creek within 2.4 miles.\n\nThe WWT Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule, although Alabama is not an OSHA state.  The WWT Division conducts training for all operators in SOP, safe handling, and emergency response procedures.  All safety equipment is regul"

Both training and inspections are documented.\n\nThe WWT Division has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas in the last five years.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, WWT plant personnel will notify the Dothan Fire Department by either radio or land line.  The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas.  The annual full scale accidental release drill allows all agencies (Fire, Police, and WWT) to critque performance for improvement. The WWT Division simulates leak drills quarterly at each facility to ensure operators are trained in SOP for emergency response.\n\nPerimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect the presences of unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\nThe WWT Division reviews SOP, conduct hazard analysis, and performs an audit every three years in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule."
