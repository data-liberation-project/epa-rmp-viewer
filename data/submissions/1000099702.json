              "Description": "This prevention program applies to the Hydrogen Fluoride manufacturing unit which includes the HF generation, high purity, aqueous HF and shipping subprocesses. A PHA (Fault Tree) was conducted for the\n\nmain HF and aqueous HF processes in 1989 and was revalidated (HAZOP)in 1995, 2000, 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021. Management of change evaluations and prestartup safety reviews are conducted for all modifications. The ultra-high purity HF process was decommisioned in December of 2003. The Boron Trifluoride trailer storage area was added in 2010 and ownership was moved to Apollo in 2020.",

A process hazard analysis was conducted in 2015 and 2021.\n\nPretreatment process was added to the Multi-Products Plant (Now Apollo) in 2001 and revalidated in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2021. Apollo manages the shipments and transit of BF3. BF3 is only stored onsite, not manufactured. Management of change evaluations and pre-startup safety reviews are conducted for all modifications.",

Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities. The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors. The plant employs approximately 290 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Plant's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride. The Multiproducts Plant was converted to a 1234yf manufacturing plant in 2016. The 1234yf manufacturing plant produces 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroproene (HFO-1234yf). The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin. The 125 Plant manufactures pentafluoroethane (HFC 125). The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives. Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\n\n\n\nHFC 125 is used as a refrigerant in residential air conditioners and commercial refrigeration uni"

HCFC 124 is used in medical sterilants, rigid foam insulation manufacturing and in medium temperature refrigeration blends.HFO-1234yf is used as a refrigerant in automobile applications and is a direct replacement for HFC-134a.\n\n\n\nAclon Resin is used in the manufacture of film used in medicinal and food bubble packaging.\n\n\n\nHFC 245fa is used as a foam blowing agent in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation. Because the Geismar site stores and uses hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, trifluorochloroethylene, boron trifluoride, vinylidene fluoride, and chloroform in more than the threshold quantities specified in the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation the site is covered by the regulation.\n\n\n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Geismar Site for the affected stationary sources includes the following elements:\n\n\n\na) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the manufacturing processes,\n\nb) process design review to minimize hazard potentials,\n\nc) computer controlled processes with sophisticated interlock and shutdown protocols,\n\nd) development and implementation of accurate procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process,\n\ne) documented process safety information describing operating limits, control points and consequences of deviations,\n\nf) a system to review and manage changes to the processes and process safety information,\n\ng) an on-going mechanical integrity program that ensures critical process equipment is designed, constructed, and installed in accordance to codes and standards,\n\nh) formalized, documented inspection protocols integrated with preventive and predictive maintenance programs such as vessel thickness testing and non destructive testing to ensure the reliability of equipment,\n\ni) performance of process hazar"

Consideration was given to the amount of material released, injuries which may have occurred, and actual or potential impact both on and off the facility. There were eight accidents which involved an affected chemical at the Honeywell Geismar Site in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan:\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar site has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's use of hazardous chemicals. The site has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to accidental releases. The Plan provides for both internal site and external community emergency alerting and notification using established protocols. The plant has multiple means of communication established to alert public safety agencies. The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response, control procedures, and emergency equipment. The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Site's response activities. The Plan has been coordinated with the local emergency\n\nplanning committee and with the local sheriff's agencies that would direct all offsite community response activities. The Honeywell Geismar site maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental r"

The ERT holds annual site emergency response drills and other exercises that have been conducted jointly with the local public safety response groups.\n\n\n\nThe Geismar site utilizes audible warning systems for both onsite and offsite notification. The onsite notification system can be activated at several locations including control rooms and the plant security gate. This system has siren and voice capability that can use prerecorded or live announcements. The system is tested weekly and during routine drills by Honeywell and other companies which share the site.\n\n\n\nNotification of persons off the site property is accomplished in conjunction with the local public safety agencies by activation of a regional audible warning system. This system also has siren and voice capabilities. Annually, calendars are hand delivered to residents in the audible warning region. These calendars provide residents instructions and recommendations in response to audible warnings. The system is tested weekly.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the audible warning system, community alert networks exist to alert near neighbors. These computer-assisted systems are capable of automatically alerting residents, industries, businesses, and others in the covered area by telephone.\n\n\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nHoneywell pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations. Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.\n\n\n\nThe plant's systematic safety review program identifies action items that improve upon the existing safeguards at the Geismar site and further reduce the potential for accidental release. The process hazard analyses for the Geismar manufacturing processes are reviewed and revalidated every five years. Continuous improvement of the plant's processes and systems provides the highest level of protection from chemical incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
