To this end, Shamrock Foods will strive to continuously improve our safety and environmental performance by adhering to the following policy objectives: \n\n?      Developing and improving programs and procedures to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations \n\n?      Ensuring that personnel are properly trained and provided with appropriate safety and emergency equipment \n\n?      Taking appropriate actions to correct hazards or conditions that endanger health, safety, or the environment \n\n?      Considering safety and environmental factors in operating decisions including planning\n\n?      Monitoring our progress through periodic evaluations \n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Background\n\nThe Shamrock Food's Dairy Facility is engaged in the production of various dairy products, including pasteurized milk, cream, sour cream, cottage cheese, etc.\n\n\n\nOperations at the facility include the receipt and storage of raw milk.  The milk is then pasteurized and further processed to produce various milk products and cottage cheese.\n\n\n\nThe facility is equipped with typical dairy equipment, such as pasteurizers, homogenizers, various piping and tanks, bottling equipment, conveyors, boilers, washing equipment, and cold rooms.  Two separate and independent refrigeration units supply ammonia refrigerant to cool a glycol/water solution, which is then used to chill process equipment and storage rooms.\n\n\n\nA variety of materials and chemicals are used in the diary process, including raw milk, flavoring agents, and cleaning chemicals.  The hazardous material of primary concern is anhydrous ammonia, used in the industrial refrigeration equipment.  However, a variety of other potentially hazardous cleaning chemicals are stored and used on site. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program \n\nShamrock Dairy uses two independent ammonia refrigeration units for product and space refrigerat"

Accordingly, the facility, and its ammonia refrigeration systems, are exempted from OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard [29 CFR 1910.119], and the USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RPM) requirements [40 CFR CAA Section 112(r)] since onsite ammonia storage is under the 10,000 pound threshold. \n\n\n\nRegardless of this exemption Shamrock Diary has voluntarily determined it would implement several important elements of the PSM and RMP process as a Best Management Practice.  This RMP submittal and HAZOP Evaluation represents two of these voluntary elements.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nShamrock Foods, Dairy Division has sustained no significant or reportable releases of hazardous chemicals, including ammonia, in its history of operation. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nShamrock Foods has a number of emergency preparedness and response program elements, including the:\n\n?      Development and implementation of a detailed written Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.\n\n?      Completion of a comprehensive third party mechanical integrity assessment of the two ammonia refrigeration processes.  \n\n?      Development of a computerized Emergency Orientation Presentation for the Phoenix Fire Department. \n\n?      Successful completion of a Phoenix Fire Department Hazardous Material inspection and full completion of identified findings.\n\n?     Development and submission of Facility Emergency Response Plan (FERP), as called for by the Arizona Emergency Response Commission.\n\n?      Development and submission of a Hazardous Material Management Plan as called for in the Phoenix Unified Fire Code. \n\n?      Installation of an ammonia detection and alarm system into each ammonia refrigeration process.  Elevated ammonia levels will result in an automatic shut down of the refrigeration system, activate a high-velocity ventilation system, and provide a local and remote alarm notification.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned"
