The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Procedures Manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nSantee maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to moving into a new facility. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the ammonia refrigeration system was during the week of October 6, 1997 with Santee personnel taking full responsibility for operating the entire facility in December 1997.  The facility is located at 17851 East Railroad Street, City of Industry, California 91748.  The facility was constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 12,500 pounds of ammonia for the following three purposes: To provide cooling for 1) dairy processing, 2) warehouse cold storage, and 3) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) for offices.  With the exception of the condensers and the diffusion box (including associated piping), the entire ammonia system is located inside the engine room.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of ammonia from the thermosyphon receiver to the high pressure receiver.

      "SummaryText": "r also supplies ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  From the high pressure receiver, high pressure liquid ammonia is transferred to three accumulators that maintain ammonia at three different temperatures.  As the ammonia enters each accumulator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the temperature and the pressure.  Each accumulator supplies liquid ammonia to a distinct heat exchanger which provides cooling for one of the three purposes listed above, vaporizing the ammonia.  The heat exchangers are located in the engine room and use a secondary fluid to provide the required cooling throughout the facility.\n\nThe vapor is returned to each accumulator in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from two of the accumulators is then pulled to the compressors (6) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  The other accumulator feeds a suction accumulator which transfers the vapor to the compressors and sends any residual liquid to a transfer unit.  Upon a certain level detection in the transfer unit, hot gas from the compressors pressurizes the vessel and the liquid is then returned to the high pressure receiver.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (3) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver.  An Auto Purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The system also has a diffusion box (for equalizing pressure between vessels in the event of an emergency) and a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case\nThe worst case release at this facility is a release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel, accounting for administrative controls, in ten minutes.  The high pressure receiver is the largest vessel at the f"

All ammonia vessels are located inside the engine room, therefore, the building was used as a passive mitigation measure.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, F stability, and urban topography.  The potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998.  This release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release scenario.\n\nMITIGATIONS: It was recommended during the Process Hazard Analysis study that the ammonia sensor setpoints and the associated system actions be confirmed (R01).  This release scenario assumes that mitigation measures are not in place and therefore, the entire contents of the system was released.  The implementation of R01 will reduce the likelihood of this release scenario by increasing the possibility of early detection and system shut down.  The ammonia sensor, located in the engine room, will respond as follows:\n\nAt 50 ppm (PEL):\nActivate alarm in computer control system, alarm horn and beacon in engine room.\n\nAt 250 ppm (50% of LFL):\nActivate duct work motorized damper, purge fan, visual and audible alarms in refrigeration equipment room.\nActivate condenser purge fan and water pump for scrubbing.\nTurn off power to electric motors for the hydraulic pumps, the suction trap ammonia pump, equipment room lights, and ammonia refrigeration compressors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.25 inch leak in a high pressure liquid line that continues (33 lbs/min) until the system is empty (6.3 hours).  This release may occur outside, therefore, no passive mitigation measures were incorporated into the release rate calculations.

This release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release scenario.\n\nMITIGATIONS: This scenario assumes that no engineering or administrative controls operate.  These controls include daily inspections of the ammonia refrigeration equipment and an ammonia detection and shut down system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Santee Dairies, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, all of the ammonia is located inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condensers).  The facility uses a heat transfer medium to provide cooling throughout the plant.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\".\n\nDETECTION AND MONITORING: There are two ammonia sensors placed in strategic locations in the engine room.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds and a visible alarm is triggered.  In addition, Santee Dairies personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Santee Dairies employee (or contractor), it is immediately reported to the chief maintenance technician and the refrigeration engineer.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDEN"

An exception was made for the Process accumulator, which is piped in series with an additional suction trap.  For situations where compressors are crossed over at a different suction level there will be no high level cut out for the crossed-over compressors.  During these cross over situations, plant managers will have to monitor the high level alarms for proper compressor operation.\n\nR08 Confirm and document that the return glycol temperature is interlocked with the glycol pump to shut down on high temperature.\n\nCOMPLETE:  The heat exchanger glycol pump is monitored for operation only.  Actual control of the glycol pump should be part of University Mechanica"
