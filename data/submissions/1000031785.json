      "SummaryText": "Heartland Corn Products operates as a fuel ethanol production plant located in near Winthrop, in Sibley County, Minnesota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Heartland Corn Products completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds for pentane, isopentane, butane, neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane), and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHeartland Corn Products is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically anhydrous ammonia as a toxic and pentane and isopentane as flammables.  Pentane, isopentane, butane, and neopentane constituents of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Heartland Corn Products to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Heartland Corn Products to notify the Winthrop City Fire Department and Sibley County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a fermentation process co-product known as dried distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be approximately 130,000 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one aboveground bullet tank.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoli"

The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be approximately 760,000 pounds.  The natural gasoline is stored in three aboveground tanks (one 500,000-pound tank at the West Plant; and one 170,000-pound tank and one 89,000-pound tank at the East Plant) as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  Denaturant tanks are located in tank farm containment dikes.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Heartland Corn Products evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to the reportable substances.  The Worst Case Scenario for the West Plant denaturant did not encompass all the receptors for the East Plant denaturant tank; therefore, Heartland Corn Products has reported Worst Case Scenarios for both the West Plant and East Plant denaturant tanks.  Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Heartland Corn Products has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough the completion of this RMP, Heartland Corn Products has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements under 29 CFR 1910.120.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nHeartland Corn Products does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental "

This facility began operations in April of 1995.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHeartland Corn Products has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored and used at the facility.  These efforts have been coordinated with state and federal regulating agencies and local responders.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs previously mentioned, Heartland Corn Products is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  Heartland Corn Products management is committed to promoting a safe work environment.  Heartland Corn Products will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, Heartland Corn Products has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, compliance audits, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.
