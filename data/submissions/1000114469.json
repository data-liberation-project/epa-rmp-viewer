Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBWC Buttonwillow Service Yard has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, BWC Buttonwillow Service Yard continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved BWC Buttonwillow Service Yard's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that BWC Buttonwillow Service Yard's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nBWC Buttonwillow Service Yard has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing"

During ammonium phosphate production anhydrous ammonia is pumped from a large storage tank through piping and valves into a heat exchanger where the liquid ammonia is heated as it is used to cool ammonium polyphosphate. From there, the liquid ammonia continues to the reactor where it is mixed with super phosphoric acid. A chemical reaction occurs in the reactor which results in the formation of ammonium polyphosphate.\n\nThe ammonia system at BWC Service Yard consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the ammonia system at BWC Service Yard is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nBWC Buttonwillow Service Yard has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia process at the BWC Buttonwillow Service Yard facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 210,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur  personnel monitor the ammonia process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nBWC Buttonwillow Service Yard has ha"

The ammonia process is used to store and resell anhydrous ammonia as fertilizer and also to produce ammonium polyphosphate. \n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nBWC Service Yard is located at 401 Front St Buttonwillow, CA 93206. The latitude and longitude of the ammonia storage tank is 35.399306, -119.463006. The facility is located approximately 90 feet south of state highway 58 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land and some residential areas.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\nBWC Service Yard is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that BWC Service Yard had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\nThe ammonia process operates as follows: Ammonia is supplied by a vendor into the ammonia storage tank. From there it is stored until a sale is made, at which time a Buttonwillow Service Yard employee transfers ammonia from the storage tank into a smaller trailer-mounted nurse tank. The nurse tanks are towed by trucks off site for the fertilizer application. \n\nIn addition, the ammonia in the storage tank is used on select"
