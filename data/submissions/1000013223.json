Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Cook\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Ham to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Cook\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs will also comply with all Federal, State, and local laws.  The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Cook\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Ham takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe facility Environmental Coordinator is responsible for the overall management of the IRM-PSM ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCook\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Ham produces pork products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool or freeze the food products and production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the Kansas City, MO facility ecceeds the 10,000 Lbs. threshold.   Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the facility. \n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Cook\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Ham \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Kansas City, MO facility has a program level 3 accidental release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Manag"

This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7Fire Plan\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7Ammonia Leak Procedures\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7Evacuation Procedures\n\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeration system was analyzed in a March 2009 third party PHA Revalidation. The recommended changes have been evaluated and are being implemented as required."
