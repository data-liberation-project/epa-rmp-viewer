The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Reiff Grain and Feed are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to migrate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for bothe direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 102,000 pounds in one 12,000 gallon tank and one 18,000 gallon tank.  The truck transport is also capable of storing 40,000#.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank releasedas a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design and safety standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.   The distance to the endpoint is 1.1 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The North American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydr"

The Emergency Response Program\n\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.  A written emergecy response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
