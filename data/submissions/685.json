A MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN MID 1999 ADDED MEMBRANE FILTRATION TECHNOLOGY, NEW FEED EQUIPMENT, AND A NEW HIGH-LIFT PUMPING STATION FOR INCOMING RAW WATER. THE PLANT HAS AN AVERAGE DAILY FLOW OF 12 MGD WITH A DAILY MAXIMUM DESIGN CAPACITY OF 40 MGD. THE PLANT USES CHLORINE SUPPLIED IN 1-TON CYLINDERS TO TREAT INCOMING WATER FROM LAKE MICHIGAN WITH CHLORINE AS A DISINFECTING AGENT PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION INTO THE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM. CHLORINE IS AUTOMATICALLY METERED INTO THE WATER BY AUTOMATED PROCESS EQUIPMENT. A CHLORINE MONITOR AND ALARM SYSTEM IS INSTALLED IN THE ENCLOSED ROOM WHERE THESE CYLINDERS ARE USED AND STORED. ADDITIONAL HALOGEN SHUT-OFF VALVES ARE INSTALLED AT THE CYLINDER(S) IN USE WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT-OFF THE FLOW OF CHLORINE GAS IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
