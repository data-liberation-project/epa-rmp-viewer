To achieve this, we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\n\n2.0 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handeled\n\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural chemical pesticides at its plant located at 4100 East Washington Boulevard in Commerce, California.  The facility consists of various type buildings, chemical reactors, aboveground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar loading/unloading stations, peripheral tanks, a warehouse and various ancillary equipment.  The plant employs typically a hundred and fifteen full-time employees and operates on a three shift, twenty four-hour basis.\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals Manufacturers, a Primary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 2879 for Agricultural Chemical Manufacturers.  It has Secondary SIC Codes of 2869 (Chemical Industrial Organics) and 5191 (Farm Supplies).  The plant is involved in the manufacture of pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).  \n\n* Toxic Substances:\n1. Chlorine, CAS 7782-50-5 used in the PCNB manufacturing process.\n2. Bromine, CAS 7726-95-6 used in the Naled manufacturing process.\n3. Carbon Disulfide, CAS 75-15-0 used in the Metam Sodium/K-Pam/DTC manufacturing process.\n* Flammable Substances: \n1. Dimethylamine, CAS 124-40-3 used in the DTC manufacturing process.\n2.

Chlorine is received at AMVAC's facility as a liquid, which is vaporized and used as a gas in the PCNB process.\n\nNaled Manufacturing Process:\n\nThe AHM associated with the Naled process is Bromine.  The production of Naled is accomplished via reaction in a batch reactor with Bromine injected under controlled conditions.\n\nMetam Sodium/DTC/K-Pam Manufacturing Process:\n\nAHMs associated with this process are monomethylamine (for Metam Sodium/K-Pam manufacturing) and dimethylamine (for DTC manufacturing).  There are no by-products or off-gas produced in the reaction.\n\n3.0 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the capabilities, design features and back up of the systems handling the regulated chemicals, AMVAC recognizes that the safe operation of the plant requires a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical properties of all materials and the implementation of safe handling practices.\n\n4.0 The Five Year Accident History\n\nTwo accidents/incidents involving Acutely Hazardous Materials have occurred within the past five years. One involved a release of 2 pounds of methylamine and minor onsite injury to one employee while the other involved the release of less than half a pound of methylamine and minor onsite injury to one employee.  There were no other onsite or offsite injuries or consequences.  Corrective measures and procedures have since been implemented to further reduce the risk of releases.  \n\n5.0 The Emergency Response Program\n\nAll units are equipped with multiple levels of protection.  The potential for spills or releases  is low.  However, in the event that a spill or release occurs, there are established written procedures for the handling of any emergency.\n\nThese include the Emergency Response Plan and the Operating Procedures Manuals.  The Emergency Response plan for the AMVAC facility (last revised 06/06/2003) i"

The operating procedure manuals for each process contain more specific emergency response information for each area.\n\nTo maintain and upgrade our emergency response capability, AMVAC conducts regularly scheduled inspections of this facility and equipment, and conducts emergency response drills for personnel.  The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and/or when:\n\nA. There is a major change in the facility operation that changes the potential for fires, explosions, release of hazardous substances, such that changes in the response are necessary for any emergency.\nB. The plan fails in an emergency.\nC. There is a change of emergency coordinators/responders.\nD. There is a change of emergency equipment.\n\nAny incident or emergency, which results in a chemical release that exceeds its Reportable Quantity (RQ) is reported to the following or corresponding agencies, as applicable:\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Department, Los Angeles Fire Prevention-Conservation Bureau, Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC), National Response Center, South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), Cal-OSHA, Los AngelesCounty Sanitation District, California Office of Emergency Services, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Fish and Game, Los Angeles County Department of Public Works (Environmental Programs and Flood Maintenance), and State Warning Center for Release Reporting.\nAny serious work-related injury, illness or death is reported to the Cal-OSHA office immediately, but no longer than 8 hours after employer's knowledge of incident.  All incidents will be reviewed and investigated as to its c"

      "SummaryText": "ause and methods for future prevention.\nAll plant personnel receive training on the implementation of the emergency response plan upon hire and periodic refresher training on the various aspects of the plan.\nFurthermore, copies of the Emergency Response plan have been submitted to the local Fire Department, City of Commerce Emergency Preparedness Officer, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the nearby hospitals. These agencies are therefore informed of and in agreement with the content and approach of the plan.\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAMVAC currently has no additional detailed or defined plans for any changes such as installation of additional mitigation or control equipment, technology, organizational changes, etc.  However, there is an on going program that identifies such opportunities as part of the safety committee, which formally addresses any and all employyee safety related issues and suggestions.  AMVAC will continue to improve the safety performance accordingly."
