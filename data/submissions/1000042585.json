The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe terminal conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of process startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tTo verify that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the terminal will periodically conduct a compliance audit to determine whe"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nMosaic Crop Nutrition, Henderson, Kentucky Terminal\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic Crop Nutrition, LLC Henderson facility transports and stores anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from river barges at the dock and transferred via aboveground pipeline to two interconnected aboveground storage vessels of 8,000,000 gallon capacity.  The liquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in the vessels at -27 degrees F, and is transferred under pressure via pipeline through heat exchanges to an unloading station where cargo tank trucks are filled.  The anhydrous ammonia from this facility is typically used as a crop nutrient.\r\n\r\nThe RMP notes a catastrophic release scenario with a toxic endpoint of 7.8 miles, taking into consideration the 9 ft pond and dike system surrounding the tanks, and an alternate release scenario of a ruptured pipe which shows a toxic endpoint of 3.1 miles.  Public receptors are located within these radii. \r\n\r\nThe Henderson Terminal is engaged in the storage and transport of liquefied anhydrous ammonia, a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the Henderson Terminal, the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM requirements, and therefore, the Henderson Terminal satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP program.  The Henderson Terminal has a fully implemented OSHA PSM standard requirement, which is used as the RMP prevention plan to prevent accidental releases and plan for emergency actions. \r\n\r\nA brief summary of the implemented PSM program is as follows:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information, which defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a process.  The terminal maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the ammonia storage and transportation process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process paramet"

Specific individuals are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe terminal has a comprehensive program to confirm that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The terminal primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as expertise in systems control technology and engineering.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) process startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Mosaic and the terminal have implemented an employee participation plan and training for all employees involved in operating a process.
