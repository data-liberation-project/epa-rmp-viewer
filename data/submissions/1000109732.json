This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements established at the facility since 1993. Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as modernization of transfer operations, piping upgrades, training personnel and considering safety in design during construction and installation is an investment in good business practices. Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases and reduce the risk to employees and the public. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release."

The recommendations from this analysis were incorporated in the 2001 facility upgrade and subsequent modifications.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy has been established by Midstream management and implemented by the employees. In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area. The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nMidstream maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies and a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe five-year accident history, which is based on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and Title 19 CCR 2735.4 shows that this facility has not had a reportable incident during the period from 2019 to 2024.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPlanned changes to improve safety have been established based upon the PSM/RMP compliance audits and PHA revalidations. Recommendations from the PHAs will continue to be implemented in a timely manner based on priority established by risk assessment. Additional training on employee responsibilities in the RMP/"

Employee participation includes issuing Hot Work permits, reviewing and participating in hazard reviews and MOCs, conducting contractor orientations, and annually reviewing operating procedures.\n\nThe fire protection system includes a fire water storage tank, pumps, fire monitors, fire hydrants, loading rack deluge, gas detectors, and fire detection systems interlocked to shutdown the process and activate the deluge. In addition, the process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shut off valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment and excess flow devices. The loading rack operator and truck driver are in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\nIn May 1999, an external event analysis consisting of a preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted.

Prior to being owned by Crestwood West Coast LLC the fractionator was owned and operated by Inergy Services. Inergy, L.P. acquired the Rogas facility on October 1, 2003. The Rogas Facility is a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) loading and unloading rail car transfer facility. The facility operations are regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARP) and 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 Risk Management Program (RMP). This facility meets the requirements for a PSM/RMP Program Level 3 and is covered under the Midstream North Coles Levee/Rogas PSM/RMP Accidental Release Prevention Program. The facility management has implemented the prevention program described below.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Rogas facility consists of eleven rail spurs (276 rail car capacity) and two loading/unloading racks that can handle a total of 30 rail cars. Rogas is connected to the Midstream North Coles Levee Fractionator via six pipelines (five LPG/NGL and one Process Vapors).\n\nIn 2004 the facility and pipelines were modernized with the addition of computer controls, four rail spurs, and a new loading/unloading rack.  In addition, all piping and transfer control devices were replaced. The facility design standards for the modernization included the 1997 Uniform Building Code, ANSI B31.3-1996 Process Piping, NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code-2001, Federal Railroad Association, and Department of Transportation. Fire protection upgrades are compliant with the California Fire Code and Kern County Fire Department.\n\nIn 2009/2010 the facility underwent a facility expansion by adding three additional"
