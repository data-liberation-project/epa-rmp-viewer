The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\n\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n\n\n\n?    Use of regulated substances in threshold quantities\n\n?    Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n\n?    North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n\n?    Five-year accident history\n\n?    OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119 applicability\n\n\n\nCentennial Energy, LLC (Centennial) has reviewed the regulations and believes that transloading operations do not meet the definition of a Stationary source (?68.3).  In deference to their partners at this site, Centennial has prepared this RMP under Program 3 requirements because:\n\n\n\n?    The site handles a Liquidifed Petroleum Gas (LPG), including propane, butane, or a mixture of these gases in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).\n\n?    A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (e.g. residence).\n\n?    The site maintains an OSHA PSM because propane and LPG are flammable gases/liquids which are handled in quantifies greater than 10,000 pounds and the facility is normally occupied.\n\n\n\nElements required by USEPA 40 CFR 68 Subparts B through H for Program 3 are presented in Sections 2 through 10 of this document and the Appendices.\n\n\n\n1.1    ?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCentennial has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.

Centennial's mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation, operation,  and maintenance of our processes. Centennial's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, transloading personnel are trained to follow Centennial's emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2    ?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Sand Springs Transloading Site, located at 125 E. Morrow Road in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, performs transloading of propane, LPG and butante (hereafter referred to as LPG) from railcars to tank trucks.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Sand Springs Transloading Site which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is a LPG railcar. This vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees, third party contractors, and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity. In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Sand Springs Transloading Site follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\n1.3    ?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPrevention Program 3 elements are presented in the following sec"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCentennial develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, Centennial has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. Centennial ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nCentennial also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

The analyses are conducted using a team of Centennial personnel and/or third party contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This PHA (Process Hazards Analysis) Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, Centennial updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances. The PHA Revalidation verities that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings/recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval/revision, "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Centennial maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nCentennial has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees and third-party contractors involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in transloading operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, "

Information about safety and health hazards;\n\n?    Emergency response plan requirements; and\n\n?    Safe work practices prior to their beginning work. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Centennial evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Centennial personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nCentennial conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
