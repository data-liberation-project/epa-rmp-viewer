These asset changes increased the maximum volume of inventories as well as changes to the reported release scenario analysis.      \n\n\n\nAdditional revisions included increased maximum inventory for previously reported worst case scenario in addition to substance temperature increase of the offsite consequence analysis parameters thus affecting the endpoint distance.\n\n\n\nMinor updates to DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US Inc. registration information to include facility and parent company name changes and facility location address updates.    \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDDP Specialty Electronic Materials US Inc. Site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDDP Specialty Electronic Materials US Inc.

Site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation, calculations of The Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion and Chemical Exposure Indices are performed, and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Fault Tree Analysis and Safer Technology and Alternative Analysis (STAA).  A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US Inc.  Site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.
