The program is designed to inform all Site employees (hereafter referred to as Associates) of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, RPC has developed and implemented the \"Rich Products Corporation Standards for Safety Performance\" which outlines the corporate policy for safety policies, safety procedures, and sample programs to be implemented at each Rich Products Corporation Facility.\n\n\n\nRPC is guided by a set of core values that include:\n\n\n\n? Cherish Our Culture - Work, learn and celebrate together;\n\n? Innovate - Imagine what's possible and create what's valued;\n\n? Be the Trusted First Choice - Listen, understand and deliver for customers like no other company;\n\n? Better Our Communities - Devote time and talent where we work and live; and\n\n? Do What's Right - No matter what.\n\n\n\nRPC is committed to an irrevocable obligation to act responsibly in every decision made and with every person encountered.

The Site is located on a 15.451-acre parcel of land that includes an approximately 280,000-square foot structure for office, research and development, manufacturing, maintenance, and warehouse uses. The Site building was originally constructed in 2005/2006 as a spec building. The Site commenced operations in approximately 2013. The Facility normally operates 7 days per week, 24 hours per day.\n\n\n\nThe Site manufactures dough products, pizza crusts, and frozen pizzas, which are frozen for shipment. The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 311824 (Frozen Doughs Made From Purchased flour)\n\n\n\nAs part of the Site's refrigeration system, which is used to freeze the dough products, pizza crusts, and frozen pizzas for shipment, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical as defined in the USEPA's RMP Rule and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold  for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Facility is registered to Program Level 3 under the USEPA CAPP program.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia, which is liquefied under pressure, is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Facility's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard ope"

RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Facility's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility.
