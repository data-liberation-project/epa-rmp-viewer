Chlorine is an effective destroyer of pathogens in water/wastewater.  Our employees and their families live here and we are all dedicated to the safe operation of our facility.\n\n\n\nThe safety of our employees and of the public of the utmost concern.  As a part of the public \n\nservice sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment. \n\n\n\nWe treat the wastewater for the City of Toledo.  Part of the process requires ensuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the public.  \n\n\n\nOur system includes automatic alarms and a scrubber system.  We have procedures in place to respond to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator.  In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, the EPA and OSHA rules regulate our activities.\n\n\n\nThis facility has had no reportable chlorine accidents in the past 10 years.  No fatalities or serious permanent injuries have occurred during this period.  No offsite effects of a release have occurred in the last 10 years.\n\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with local fire department responders \n\nand the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  We have training every year for our \n\npeople and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis.  \n\n\n\nWe are constantly looking for methods to improve.  As part of this PSM/RMP program \n\nwe perform an extensive self-evaluation with the assistance of our employees, other government agencies, and other professional consultants as well.\n\n\n\nRespectfully Submitted"
