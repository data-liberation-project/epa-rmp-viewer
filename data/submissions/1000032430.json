The facility is located at 200 South 2nd Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68508.  The NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 500 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The refrigeration system inventory at the facility exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia during the previous five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \r\n\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and"

All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\r\n\r\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room.  The system shutdown is located adjacent to the engine room.\r\n\r\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident response drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place.  Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\r\n\r\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.
