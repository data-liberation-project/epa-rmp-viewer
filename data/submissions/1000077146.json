The facility has actively implemented all of the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management System to review the safety of processes that could pose a hazard to employees and the public.  These PSM policies define the manner in which the processes are maintained and inspected, operated, and modified.  The PSM policies also define the manner in which the processes are evaluated for safe operation and the training of the personnel employed to operate and maintain the facility.  Safe Work Procedures are in place for hot work, lock-out/tagout, line break, and hot tap work to prevent accidental releases and maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n\n\nIn the event that an accidental release were to occur, DNI has established an Emergency Response Plan which is used to guide the response.  The facility has a well-trained emergency services team comprised of firefighters, medical personnel, hazardous materials technicians, and rescue personnel.   DNI is a member of the Laramie County Mutual Aid Organization which may be called upon and provide additional resources to emergencies.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDNI produces industrial chemicals and fertilizer products. Finished products shipped from the facility are Anhydrous Ammonia, Ammonium Nitrate Liquid, Ammonium Nitrate Prills, Urea Liquid Solution, Urea-Ammonium Nitrate Solution, Ammonium Nitrate Emulsion, Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), and Carbon Dioxide. These products are produced from natural gas, air, ammonia, and water.\n\n\n\nDNI handles the following regulated substances in quantities greater than the threshold amount:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, Ammonia Solutions (>20%), and Chlorine.\n\n\n\nGeneral Acciden"

      "SummaryText": "tal Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Action Steps\n\n\n\nA multi-faceted approach is used in the prevention of accidental releases in the facility. Equipment integrity is maintained by following proper design, fabrication, and installation, and maintenance practices and design codes.  Solid, well written operating procedures and training programs for personnel in the facility are used to prevent process upsets and equipment damage.   Continuous monitoring of the facility's processes is accomplished by both process operators and computer control to operate within equipment and process limitation.  Advisory alarms and emergency shutdown systems are designed and tested to automatically limit the potential for a release.  Incident investigations are used to learn the cause of both near misses and incidents so those corrective action steps may be implemented to prevent the future incidents.\n\n\n\nFollowing is a partial listing of chemical specific programs in the facility to prevent releases.   The use of portable ammonia specific detection equipment to detect and repair minor leaks in the facility.   Continuous monitoring of ammonia rail car unloading and truck loading by video cameras and personnel.  Chlorinators for delivery of chlorine to cooling water systems, which automatically stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a break in the delivery tubing.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nDNI experienced a release with on site consequences in 2014.  Employee had break through of respirator during high ammonia event resulting in respiratory distress. Administered first aid and transported to the Emergency Room.  Tripped flows out of the process and secured plant.  The operator suffered no long term effects from the exposure and quickly recovered. \n\n\n\nThe site experienced a second release with on site consequences in 2018.   A short duration release of chlorine occurred from a line on the cooling tower dosing system which resulted in a personnel exposure. The ope"

Shortly after, the operator developed mild respiratory symptoms and was taken to local emergency room for evaluation.   The operator suffered no long term effects from the exposure and quickly recovered.    \n\n\n\nThe site has had no other incidents with on or off site consequences in the last 5 years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDNI maintains a written emergency response program with procedures to address both large and small incidents.   The facility maintains a volunteer emergency services team with members trained as firefighters, medical personnel, hazardous materials technicians, and rescue personnel.   DNI is a member of the Laramie County Industrial Mutual Aid Organization which can provide additional resources to emergencies in the community and member facilities.  The facility maintains an array of emergency response equipment and supplies.   Routine training for all personnel is held as necessary to ensure the team can perform their assigned response duties.  The facility also participates in the community Local Emergency Planning Committee."
