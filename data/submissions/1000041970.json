The Salt Lake City Facility has established a highly cooperative relationship with the South Davis Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of normal storage practices and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.  \r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City Facility stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia and chlorine cylinders.  Covered processes include unloading, loading and storing pre-packaged chemicals for resale to commercial accounts.  No manufacturing or repackaging is performed at this facility.  \r\n\r\nPre-packaged anhydrous ammonia and chlorine containers are stored indoors at designated locations.  All cylinders are inspected upon arrival at the facility to ensure that they meet all applicable safety codes.  The cylinders are stored upright, with cylinder caps and storage tags in place.  One-hundred fifty (150) pound cylinders of both chemicals are chained to a wall at opposite ends of the warehouse.  One-ton containers of chlorine are blocked in place in the warehouse.  Anhydrous ammonia skids have flat bases and require no restraints.  All containers meet DOT specifications and the suppliers (other Hill Brothers Chemical Company facilities) maintain them in proper condition.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has PSM and Risk Management programs in place to manage handling of regulated substances.
