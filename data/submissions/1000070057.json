The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nAmmonium Polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer is produced by blending anhydrous ammonia with super-phosphoric acid in a reacting chamber and then mixing with water.  The process equipment is physically connected by transfer hose to the process piping connected to two (2) 30,000 gallon stationary anhydrous ammonia pressure vessels.  The process equipment consists of a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  The MPR ancillary equipment includes transfer hoses, liquid pumps, process piping, reacting chamber, valves, pumps, evaporative cooling tower, flow meters, and pressure and temperature gauges.  The MPR does not have any storage capabilities for anhydrous ammonia. The APP product is not subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThis covered process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations and the IFRC is responsible for the development and implementation of its PSM.  Contractor Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) transfer of anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid, and water to the MPR; (2) monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures; and (3) transfer of APP to storage.  The IFRC is responsible for training its Operators in accordance with the IFRC PSM.  The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the MPR operations.\n\n  ",

Although the process is not subject to the OSHA PSM rules, the Facility has incorporated this process into its PSM/RMPr combined management plan.  The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nThe Base fertilizer product is produced by mixing 23% aqua ammonia with water and other ingredients.  The process equipment is physically connected by process piping to the 23% aqua ammonia AST. The process equipment includes: (1) a 20,000-gallon stationary AST and ancillary process piping, valves, and liquid pump; and (2) a stationary blender and ancillary process piping, valves, liquid pumps, evaporative cooling tower, scale, and temperature gauges.  The blender is open top and does not have any storage capabilities for aqua ammonia. \n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) transfer of aqua ammonia, water, and other ingredients to the blender; (2) monitoring of flows and temperatures; and (3) transfer of product to storage.  These operations are conducted in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Mechanical Integrity Procedures.  The fertilizer product is not subject to the RMP Rule.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR ? 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is resubmitting the EPA RMP to reflect changes in the overall program management at this Facility.  Helena recently acquired this Facility and has completed the transition from the prior owner PSM/RMP program to the Helena PSM/RMP program.   \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 284,685 lbs, and the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at this Facility is 61,068 lbs (i.e. anhydrous ammonia equivalent).  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia is the sum of two stationary pressure vessels (i.e. 279,830 lbs or 139,915 lbs each), 14 cylinders (i.e. 2,155 lbs) and 3 TONNERS (i.e. 2,700 lbs).  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia is the sum of one AST containing 29% anhydrous ammonia equivalent (i.e. 31,234 lbs) and one AST containing 23% anhydrous ammonia equivalent (i.e. 29,835 lbs).\n\n\n\nAlthough the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 284,685 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 564,515 lbs.  The reason for this is because a single anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel (i.e. 139,915 lbs) is counted two more times to account for the Aqua Ammonia Blending and APP Blending processes that are connected to one of the stationary pressure vessels.  Although the "

      "SummaryText": "maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at this Facility is 61,068 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 90,903 lbs.  The reason for this is because the maximum quantity of 29% and 23% anhydrous ammonia equivalent (i.e. 61,068 lbs) is accounted for in the Aqua Ammonia Storage & Handling Process and the maximum quantity of the 23% anhydrous ammonia equivalent (i.e. 29,835 lbs) is counted one more time to account for the Base Blending process that is connected to the 23% AST.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\no Covered Process 1: NH3 Storage and Handling\n\no Covered Process 2: Aqua Ammonia Blending\n\no Covered Process 3: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\n\no Covered Process 4: Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Blending\n\no Covered Process 5: Base Blending\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all five (5) covered processes.  The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released. For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 2, and 4), the worst case release was modeled as if a 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature. For the aqua ammonia, two releases were modeled. One worst case release scenario assumes that a 16,900-gallon aqua ammonia (29%) AST failed and instantaneously spills the content into an area with secondary containment resulting in a release being evaporation at the maximum temperature. The other worst case release scen"

Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.  The alternative scenario for aqua ammonia (29%) assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to a 3-inch transfer hose failure during an unloading procedure associated with Covered Process 3.  The alternative scenario for aqua ammonia (23%) assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to a 4-inch HDPE process pipe failure during an unloading procedure associated with Covered Process 5.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Operations Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.
