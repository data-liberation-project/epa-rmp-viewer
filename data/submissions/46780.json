              "Description": "The Frick Engine Room Ammonia Refrigeration System for the Garland Business Park cold storage facility located in Garland, Texas maintains several temperature levels utilizing anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium.  The system contains two high temperature screw compressors, two low temperature screw compressors and one booster screw compressor.  The system provides approximately 250 tons of refrigeration at 0F.  The system utilizes liquid injection for cooling the oil in the screw compressors.\n\nThe system contains three evaporative condensers to convert the high pressure ammonia gas into high pressure liquid.  After the high pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high pressure liquid receiver.  The high pressure liquid is then transferred to a high suction recirculator and from there to the low suction and booster suction recirculators.  \n\nThe liquid ammonia is pumped from the high suction, low suction and booster suction recirculators to evaporators to provide the desired temperature level for various areas of the facility.  After the liquid ammonia is vaporized in the evaporators, the \"wet\" ammonia vapor is returned to the high suction, low suction and booster suction recirculators.  \"Dry\" ammonia vapor is then transferred from the recirculators to the suction of the high temperature, low temperature and booster temperature compressors.\n\nThe system contains a purger to remove non-condensables and allow the condensers to work at their full capacity.\n\nIn addition, an ammonia leak detection system has been included in the installation of the Frick Engine Room Ammonia Refrigeration System.",

The purpose of the study was to apply the \"What-If\" methodology of process hazard analysis (PHA) to the system to determine the results of unexpected or unplanned events that could produce adverse consequences.\nMany safety features were included in the original design of the refrigeration system.  Through the application of the \"What-If\" process, additional safety equipment and/or procedures to enhance the safe operation of this process have been identified.  This report includes three (3) recommendations to reduce the potential consequences or eliminate the identified hazards associated with operation of this ammonia refrigeration system.\nThese recommendations are summarized in order of priority as follows:\n2006-1Conduct infrared scanning of the electrical system every two years.\n2006-2Install ammonia detection in the candy room before the room is placed into service.\n2006-3Install self-closing valves on the oil pots.  The valve should close automatically when released during oil draining procedures."
