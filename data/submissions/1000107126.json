This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the Fond du Lac LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Saputo \u0096 Waupun facility is located at N3545 County Hwy EE, Waupun, WI 53963. The plant\u0092s primary products cheese and whey manufacturing. The facility employs approximately 371 full-time employees. The Saputo - Waupun facility consists of two refrigeration systems in proximity of each other and are interconnected through the secondary refrigerant side (glycol system). The Cheese Building, or Main Plant, and the Refrigeration Building. The combined systems are over the THQ for anhydrous ammonia and fall under a single RMP/PSM program. The Cheese Building, or Main plant, contains 18,782 lbs. and the Refrigeration Building contains 20,860 lbs. for a total of 40,645 lbs. of ammonia.\n\n?\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Saputo - Waupun plant follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP and OSHA PSM programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM and other"

      "SummaryText": "environmental programs.\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo - Waupun has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo - Waupun developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo\u0092s Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety, Risk Group and Department of Environmental affairs will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
