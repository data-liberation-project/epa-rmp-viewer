This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meeting with local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n\n\na)    All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public.\n\nb)    All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards and procedures.\n\nc)    Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals.\n\nd)    Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\n\n\nThese corporate polices also empha the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and/or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\n\n\nIt is the company's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, trained  personnel will respond in a defensive manner to isolate or remotely stop the leak.  The company has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substance handled.\n\n\n\n 2) Stationary Source(s) and Regulated Substance(s) Handled\n\nThe Henderson Terminal is engaged in the storage and transport of liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from river barges at the dock and transferred via an aboveground pipeline to two interconnected aboveground storage vessels.  The "

The anhydrous ammonia from this facility is typically used as a crop nutrient by various end users.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance present at the Henderson Terminal that exceeds the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the Henderson Terminal, the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM requirements, and therefore, the Henderson Terminal satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP program.  The Henderson Terminal has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program.  A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe Henderson Terminal encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention.  The Henderson Terminal has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in accident prevention and process safety.\n\n\n\nThe Henderson Terminal keeps a wide variety of technical documents that are used to safely operate the anhydrous ammonia process.  These documents address the chemical properties and associated hazards and limits for key parameters of process operation.  Specific plant personnel have an assignment to keep this information up to date.\n\n\n\nThe Henderson Terminal has conducted a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia are identified and controlled.  The Henderson Terminal periodically revalidates its PHA to incorpo"

The revalidation occurs at least every five years and the recommendation and resolutions are kept for the life of the process.  This revalidation process has been recently completed.\n\n\n\nThe Henderson Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Conducting training; (2) Developing written procedures; (3) Performing inspection and tests in accordance with recognized standards, and (4) Correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.\n\n\n\nThe Henderson Terminal also has procedures in place to ensure continuation of the PSM program, including writing and periodically updating operating procedures, training, operating and maintenance personnel, management of change programs, contractor safety programs; plus an audit schedule that meets OSHA PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nMoreover, The Henderson Terminal has active mitigation measures in place to prevent and/or minimize accidental releases.  These measures include: vessel construction standards, a vessel flare, safety relief valves and continuous leak monitoring.\n\n\n\n4) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances stored above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.
