The Washington Department of Labor and Industries (WISHA) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule are required by the Clean Air Act Amendments and are outlined in the Washington State Regulation WAC 296-67 and the Federal Regulation 40 CFR Part 68 respectively. This PSM/RMP are intended to aid American Water CDM in our efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the work place and possibly to the surrounding community. This Program will ensure full compliance with Regulations WAC 296-67 and 40 CFR Part 68 and should serve to enhance American Water CDM's relationship with our neighbors in Duvall and Carnation.\n\nThe major objective of the PSM/RMP for highly hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals especially to locations that could expose employees and others to serious health hazards. An effective PSM/RMP requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach--the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that impact the unit processes--were all considered in our evaluation. The various lines of defense were incorporated into American Water CDM's design and operation of the Tolt Treatment Facility (Tolt) to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals were re-evaluated and enhanced to assure their effectiveness.\n\nChemicals stored at the Tolt Treatment Facility that are targeted by the PSM and/or the RMP are Chlorine, Ozone, and Propane. \n*Chlorine is stored in quantities above the WAC 296-67 threshold limit of 1,500 lbs, and stored in quantities above the 40 CFR  Part 68 threshold"

Containers will be stored in an enclosed building with a chlorine scrubber and gas containment provided by the building. The facility is equipped with gas detectors that will activate the scrubber system in the event of a chlorine release. The facility is stafffed 24 hours a day by a licensed water treatment operator. During normal business hours there may be other employees, contractors, and/or consultants engaged in work at the facility. The chemical storage area at the facility is a secured zone and all access doors will be locked at all times unless authorized personnel are present. American Water CDM is committed to protecting employees, the public, and the environment from the release of chlorine gas."
