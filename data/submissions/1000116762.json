The exposure-response relationship between a hazardous substance and adverse health effects is typically described using statistical models. These models account for factors that may affect the accuracy of exposure-response estimates, such as data quality or the presence of other risk factors.\n\t4.5.1.4\tCharacterizing Workplace Risk - Information gathered from the three previous steps is distilled to form a clear picture of the nature and magnitude of the work-related risks. This risk characterization is used to inform risk management decisions.\n\t4.5.2\tEngineering Controls\n\t4.5.2.1\tEngineering controls protect workers by removing hazardous conditions or by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Examples include local exhaust ventilation to capture and remove airborne emissions or machine guards to shield the worker.
