      "SummaryText": "The Ute Water Treatment Plant is a 17.5 MGD conventional water treatment plant located outside of Palisade, Colorado.  The Ute Water Conservancy District provides water throughout the Grand Valley.  The plant has been producing potable water disinfected with gas chlorine since 1964.  A maximum of 16,000 lbs of chlorine gas can be stored on-site.\n\nUte water has taken many steps to ensure safety of its employees and neighboring residents.  A current list of contact information for all residents in a one mile radius is kept with our Emergency Response Plan.  We recently hosted a table top exercise with local emergency response personnel including Grand Junction Hazmat Teem, Palisade Police and Fire, the Sherriff's office and State Highway Patrol, local hospitals, the Local Emergency Planner, and the Regional Dispatch Center.  Ute Water feels that it has done everything possible to prevent a chlorine gas release and to ensure a quick and effective response if there were a release.\n\nThe Ute Water Conservancy District\u00c2\u00bfs chlorine leak prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n1.  Clearly written Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine container change over and receiving of 1 ton chlorine containers.  These procedures are strictly adhered to.\n\n2.  Annual chlorine safety training, respiratory wearer training, fit testing and medical qualification exams for all individuals involved in chlorine container change-overs and maintenance.\n\n3.  Preventative maintenance is performed on all chlorine feed equipment, the chlorine container hoist, scales, gas chlorine monitor, and exhaust fan.\n\n4.  The water treatment plant is a secure facility with barbed wire fence around the perimeter and a camera at the main entrance gate.  Intruder alarms on doors and tank hatches are tied into SCADA and the auto-dialer.  The chlorine room is secured at all times and has a warning sign reading \u00c2\u00bfPoisonous gas - Authorized Personnel Only\u00c2\u00bf.\n\n5.  The chlorine gas monitor is tested we"

The plant\u00c2\u00bfs SCADA system and auto-dialer would go into alarm.  In the event of a major chlorine gas leak, the emergency siren could be activated.\n\n6.  A recently revised and practiced Emergency Response Plan explains actions to be taken in the case of a minor or major chlorine gas leak including evacuation of the facility and the neighboring residences.\n\nUte Water has used gas chlorine for disinfection since its inception.  There has never been an accidental release of gas chlorine.  \n\nThere are no future plans for upgrades to our chlorine feed or storage equipment."
