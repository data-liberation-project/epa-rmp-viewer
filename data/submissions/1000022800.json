      "SummaryText": "Ennis Power Company, LLC operates a 320-megawatt (MW) electrical generation facility in Ennis, Ellis County, Texas.  The facility began commercial operation in May 2002.  The land use immediately surrounding the facility is rural.\n\nThe facility combusts natural gas in one combustion turbine to generate electricity.  The combustion turbine is equipped with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that utilizes waste heat from the exhaust to convert water to steam.  The steam from the HRSG is utilized to drive a steam turbine.  Electricity is generated at the gas turbine and the steam turbine.  A selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system is located within the HRSG to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the combustion turbine exhaust gas.  The SCR consists of a catalyst and injection grid within the HRSG. Ammonia is injected through the grid upstream of the catalyst.  The ammonia mixes with the exhaust gas, and as the exhaust/ammonia mixture passes through the catalyst, NOx emissions are reduced to nitrogen and water.\n\nThe ammonia injected into the HRSG is stored as 28 weight percent (wt%) aqueous ammonia in a 20,000-gallon storage tank.  No more than 17,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia solution (or approximately 127,000 lbs) is stored onsite at any time.  The aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to an ammonia skid and mixed with high temperature exhaust gas from the HRSG in a packed tower.  Upon being vaporized, the mixture is directed back to the HRSG and injected upstream of the catalyst bed.\n\nBecause the amount of aqueous ammonia onsite is greater than 20,000 pounds, the ammonia system is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 (Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations).  However, because the ammonia used at the facility is below 44%, it is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The system is not subject to the Program level 3 requirements of the RMP rule, as it is neither subject to the OSHA standard nor is it i"

The elements of the facility's RMP program include:\n     >\tA prevention program, which covers safety precautions, monitoring, standard operating procedures, employee training, preventative maintenance, maintaining specific process safety information, incident investigations, hazard reviews, and compliance audits;\n     >  An emergency response program, which spells out emergency health care, employee training measures and procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g, LEPC or fire department) should an accident occur; and \n     >\tHazard assessments that detail an accident history of the last five years, the potential effects of an accidental release, and an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental release scenarios.\n\nThe facility has implemented environmental programs and procedures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations.

Operators undergo a qualification process that addresses the aqueous ammonia system standard operating procedures and preventative maintenance procedures as well as emergency response training.\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years.  The audits focus on the aqueous ammonia system and related standard operating procedures.

The Hazard Review identified the hazards associated with the process, opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunctions or human error, and steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.

The Hazard Assessment consisted of analyzing the effects of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative case release scenario.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 40 CFR 68.3 defines the worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.\"  This definition gives no consideration to actual probability; therefore, the worst-case release scenario was analyzed as being a complete failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank and release of the entire contents to form an evaporation pool.  The surface area of the pool was limited by the dimensions of the secondary containment that was designed to hold the maximum storage volume of the tank.  The EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was utilized to determine off-site impacts and the endpoint distance.\n\nThe Hazard Assessment included the analysis of an alternative case release scenario.  The alternative case release scenario was analyzed as the formation of a one-half inch diameter hole in the transfer line between the supply or offloading tank truck and the aqueous ammonia storage tank, outside the tank containment (diked) area.  Since the truck is manned during offloading of the aqueous ammonia, it was assumed that the truck-mounted pump could be shut off almost instantaneously, but head pressure from the tank would continue the flow of aqueous ammonia through the hole.  The OCA guidance was again used to determine off-site impacts and the endpoint distance. \n\nThe facility has been operating for approximately ten years.
