      "SummaryText": "Facility and Substance Overview\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson Sales and Logistics Company, LLC distribution center located in Mooresville, IN will distribute consumer health products for the various consumer products companies that fall within the J&J Group of Consumer Companies.  The aerosol products stored and distributed primarily include the following trade names; Band-Aid Calamine Spray, Neosporin Anti-Fungal Spray, Aveeno Shave Gel, Neutrogena Sun Block Spray and Aveeno Sun Block Spray.  These products each use various amounts (or none) of the following propellants [Butane (#106-97-8), Isobutane (#75-28-5), Methyl Ether (#115-10-6), Pentane (#109-66-0)].\n\nThe consumer aerosol products are typically in metal containers, less than 8 ounces in , including the product ingredients, as well as the propellants.  The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers.  The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be 1,000-2,000 individual containers.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Mooresville Distribution Center is a new facility (currently under construction), which will start operations in April 2011.  The site has experienced no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations or know offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario was performed based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Based on the assumption that the entire contents of a cloud explodes (quantity based on weight of propellant of one palletized unit load of each) the calculated distance (in miles) to the one psi endpoint were calculated to be less than 0.06 miles (the worst case scenario was for Butane).  The calculated distance does not extend beyond the site property line (thus no offsite receptors are impacted).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency and a potential release of flammable mate"

      "SummaryText": "rials within the facility, local emergency responders (Wade Stevens Fire Department of Liberty Township) would be contacted through the use of a 911 call; secondary contact would be made to the Hendricks County Emergency Management Agency, the local district of the Indiana Emergency Management Agency. \n\nEmployees of Exel (the site operator) and Johnson & Johnson Sales and Logistics are trained and instructed to evacuate through the nearest exit in the event of a release, fire or other evacuation signal.  Employees are not responsible for any action required to contain a release or to extinguish a fire.  Emergency Response Plans and Procedures include a Hazardous Materials Inventory Summary.\n\nSafety Risk Assessment\n\nJohnson & Johnson Sales and Logistics Company contracts Factory Mutual (FM) Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting.  At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events.\n"
