Approximately three pounds of chlorine was released as the result of packing failure on one of the valves.  The injured employee was looking for the leak without wearing the appropriate PPE.  As a result of the incident, Operations was retrained on PPE requirements and new equipment was purchased to facilitate the identification of leak points. There were no offsite consequences.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nPittsburg Operations utilizes a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, Pittsburg Operations emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCA Region II LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Pittsburg Operations site has been coordinated and verified. Pittsburg Operations also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Pittsburg Operations with additional emergency response capability.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nImproving safety is a continuous process at Pittsburg Operations.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPittsburg Operations truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Element-specific employee surveys or management system reviews are conducted quarterly, and the results are summarized and shared with all site personnel. In addition, Pittsburg Operations employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at the site.\n\nContractors\nPittsburg Operations hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction, and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Pittsburg Operations has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform Pittsburg Operations of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.

Pittsburg Operations is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activity at Pittsburg Operations is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Pittsburg Operations has four regulated substances present at the site in quantities above the Federal RMP threshold quantities.  These substances are chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  The site manages sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) railcars and hydrogen fluoride railcars for a site tenant that uses those chemicals to manufacture an agricultural product. \nNote:  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler at Pittsburg Operations.  Inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) is below the Federal RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  However, the inventory is above the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program threshold quantity of 500 lbs.  Therefore, the unit operation using ammonia (anhydrous) is regulated under the CalARP Program.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nPittsburg Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

      "SummaryText": "ntory of Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) [Hydrochloric acid] below the Federal threshold quantity continues to be reported under this process to represent a unit operation that is considered a covered process due to connection to an anhydrous hydrogen chloride supply header (per the interconnectivity rule).\n\ne) 660 Block Operations, Process ID 1000130907:\nAs mentioned in item b., a unit operation formerly in 560 Block Operations, Process ID 1000130905, has been moved into 660 Block Operations, Process ID 1000130907 due to connection to the chlorine header.  In addition, a thermal oxidizing (TOX) unit has been added to this covered process.  The TOX unit operation does not contribute to inventory of regulated flammable or toxic chemicals in the process but is covered based on potential fire or explosion impact on nearby chlorine piping.\n\nf) WCS / ARS\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for all remaining unit operations and regulated chemicals were re-evaluated to be current as part of the update.  Where possible, RMP*Comp\u0099 was used more extensively for calculating release rates in place of other local data sources.  Estimated residential populations within distance to endpoint were calculated in the most current version of MARPLOT (Version 5.1.1) and updated as needed.\nToxic Alter ID: 1000112091 for aqueous ammonia in the 640 Block Operations process was removed due to the removal of that process from the resubmission.  (See item c. above)\nToxic Alter ID: 1000112087 for hydrogen fluoride in the 310 Block Operations process was removed due to the removal of that process from the resubmission.  (See item a. above.)  This ARS was replaced with a new scenario for HF release from railcar for the Site Logistics process, Process ID 1000130930.\n\n1.

The 5-year update, which is due July 12, 2024, includes general updates as well as significant changes related to the shutdown of several manufacturing unit operations onsite in late 2023 and early 2024.\n\na) 310 Block Operations \u0096 Process ID 1000130906:\nThis process has been removed completely from the current resubmission.  The two unit operations previously defined in this process handled hydrogen fluoride (HF).  These units have permanently ceased operation.  Inventories within the process equipment are below threshold quantities for HF, and process equipment has been isolated from potential HF sources.  \n\nb) 560 Block Operations \u0096 Process ID 1000130905:\nThis process has been removed completely from the current resubmission.  The two unit operations previously defined in this process handled chlorine.  One unit has permanently ceased operation with inventories below threshold quantities for chlorine and isolation from potential chlorine sources.  The second unit operation continues to be considered a covered process due to connection to the 660 Block Operations chlorine supply header (per the interconnectivity rule) and has been added into the process boundaries of the 660 Block Operations, Process ID 1000130907.\n\nc) 640 Block Operations \u0096 Process ID 1000130908:\nThis process has been removed completely from the current resubmission.  The unit operation previously defined in this process handled aqueous ammonia (concentration greater than 20%).  The unit has permanently ceased operation with inventories below threshold quantities for aqueous ammonia and isolation from potential sources of aqueous ammonia.  As a result of this change, aqueous ammonia has been removed from the site\u0092s list of regulated chemicals.\n\nd) 520 Block Operations, Process ID 1000130929:\nAn inve"
