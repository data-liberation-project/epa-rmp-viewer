      "SummaryText": "The County of Okaloosa operates the Garniers Wastewater Treatment Facility located at 714 Essex Road in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. At the treatment plant, the facility stores approximately eight (8) one-ton cylinders and a maximum of fifty (50) one hundred-fifty pound cylinders of chlorine. The one-ton cylinders are used on-site as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater. The one hundred-fifty pound cylinders are not used on site, but are used at other facilities operated by the county. The one-ton cylinders and the one hundred-fifty pound cylinders are stored in seperate areas at the facility.\n\nThe Garniers facility employs approximately 10 full-time employees. Daily inspections of the areas storing and/or using chlorine are conducted by the facility employees. In addition, both storage areas are equipped with detection systems which sound alarms if a chlorine concentration of greater than one (1) ppm is detected. The area that stores the one-ton cylinders is fully enclosed and is equipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a chlorine release. \n\nIn preparation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), both worst-case and alternative scenarios were considered. Under worst-case scenario conditions, a catostrophic event would occur releasing a full one-ton cylinder. The radius of the potentially impacted surrounding area would be 1.3 miles. This scenario is highly improbable and did not consider the mitigation of a release by the enclosure or the scrubber system.\n\nA more probable release event would occur if a transfer hose connecting the chlorine cylinder to the chlorinator was to fail. This scenario was the alternative scenario considered in the development of the RMP. This release event would have a potential impact radius of less than 0.06 miles from the site. This scenario accounted for the mitigation factors inherent by the enclosed building and an operable caustic scrubber system.\n\nThe Garniers facility has not had an an accidental release in the last five"
