              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR BROMINE\n\nTank Truck and ISO Container Unloading\n\n     One  45,000-pound tank truck or one 40,000-pound ISO container is unloaded at a time, with prevention against movement  and with constant operator attendance.  The contents are transferred by 20 psig of nitrogen pressure into the enclosed and diked storage tank, with relief valves on both the tank truck or container and the storage tank.  In event of leakage, the operator remotely closes an automatic valve to stop the flow from the shipping container.  Water from hoses would be used to cover any spilled bromine to prevent evaporation.\n\nBromine Storage Tank\n\n     The 77,250-pound storage tank and the 10-GPM transfer pump are fully enclosed and diked to contain any leakage and for protection against vehicles, fire, and solar heating.  A caustic scrubber absorbs any bromine vapors in the enclosure and during the filling of the storage tank.\n\nBromine Weigh Tank\n\n     A 5,200-pound weigh tank receives bromine from the storage tank and transfer pump, for delivery by gravity to the two bromination reactors.  The weigh tank is out-of-doors, but any leakage would drain into the storage tank enclosure and dike.  During weigh-tank filling, bromine vapors pass to the caustic scrubber.  A remote-operated valve stops flow from the weigh tank.\n\nBromination Reactors\n\n     The two 2,000-gallon bromination reactors (K18 and K-29) are protected with 3-inch-diameter, 38.5-psig rupture disks.  The bromination reactions are mildly exothermic, and the heat of reaction is removed by cooling water flowing through the reactor jackets.  A high-temperature alarm is provided to warn the operator if the operating conditions are not within the proper ranges.\n\nProcess-Safety Program\n\n     All operators have been thoroughly trained in startup, normal operation, shutdown, and emergency procedures.  Equipment is maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule.  Emergency plans have been developed and have been tested twice each year.  All employees are knowledgeable concerning the potential hazards of bromine.  The reaction processes have been subjected to intensive process hazards analysis, with periodic updating.  Any changes to the process are studied for possible safety implications, prior to the change.  Details of the process safety information, process hazards analysis, and risk and consequence analysis are available in reports dated 1990 and 1995.",

In event of leakage, the operator remotely closes an automatic valve to stop the flow from the tank truck.  Water from hoses would be used to dilute any spilled nitric acid, to retard evaporation.\n\nNitric Acid Storage Tank\n\n     The 5,000-gallon glass-lined storage tank and the 10-GPM transfer pump are within a full-containment dike, for protection against leakage and vehicles.  A water scrubber absorbs nitric-acid vapors during storage-tank filling.\n\nNitric Acid Weigh Tank\n\n     A 2,500-pound weigh tank receives nitric acid from the storage tank and transfer pump, for pump delivery at very low rates to the nitration reactor.  During weigh-tank filling, nitric acid vapors pass to a water scrubber.  A relief valve protects the weigh tank from overpressure and discharges to a water scrubber.  A remote-operated valve stops flow from the weigh tank.\n\nNitration Reactor\n\n     Flow of nitric acid to the K-9 nitration reactor is maintained at a constant low rate, with an interlock shutoff if the temperature exceeds a preset value.   Nitrations are strongly exothermic, and the heat of reaction is removed by automatically-controlled flow of cooling water or 25F. brine through cooling coils and the reactor jacket.  High-temperature and high-pressure alarms are provided to warn the operator if the operating conditions are not within the proper ranges.  Water from the fire-main system provides back-up for the normal cooling water supply.  A 4-inch-diameter rupture disk provides protection against runaway reaction (oxidation).",

              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR OLEUM\n\nTank-Truck Unloading\n\n     One tank truck containing about 40,000 pounds of 20 weight-percent oleum (\"104.5%\" sulfuric acid) is unloaded at a time, with prevention against movement and with constant operator attendance.  The contents are transferred by 35 psig of nitrogen pressure through a 1-1/4-inch Teflon/SS unloading hose and 2-inch stainless-steel piping into the diked storage tank, with a relief valve on the tank truck and an open vent (through the adjoining 98%-sulfuric-acid tank) to the atmosphere.  In event of leakage, the operator remotely closes an automatic valve to stop the flow from the tank truck.  Water from hoses would be used to dilute any spilled oleum, to retard release of sulfur trioxide.\n\nOleum Storage Tank\n\n     The 7,500-gallon stainless-steel storage tank is within a full-containment dike, for protection against leakage and vehicles.  The tank contains a submerged 50-GPM 22-psig pump, for transfers to the K-23 sulfonation reactor.\n\nSulfonation Reactor\n\n     Flow of oleum to the K-23 sulfonation reactor is manually controlled by the operator in response to indications of temperature and weight, by starting and stopping the oleum pump.  The reaction is essentially endothermic, and the heat required by the reaction is provided by the flow of hot oil through a jacket around the sulfonator, as supplied by a hot-oil system.  High-temperature and high-pressure alarms are provided to warn the operator if the operating conditions are not within the proper ranges.  A 4-inch-diameter 35-psig rupture disk provides protection against overpressure.  At the conclusion of the reaction, the temperature of the sulfonator contents is reduced by the flow of cooled oil circulating through the jacket.\n\nProcess-Safety Program\n\n     All operators have been thoroughly trained in startup, normal operation, shutdown, and emergency procedures.  Equipment is maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule.  Emergency plans have been developed and have been tested twice each year.  All employees are knowledgeable concerning the potential hazards of oleum.  The reaction process has been subjected to an intensive process hazards analysis.  Any changes to the process are studied for possible safety implications, prior to the change.  Details of the process safety information, process hazards analysis, and risk and consequence analysis are available in a report dated June 1999.",

This Executive Summary describes the regulated processes at this facility and the precautions that are taken to prevent the escape or release of noxious materials.\n\nFacility Description\n\n     The Pfister plant occupies the area between US Route 46, the Overpeck Creek, and the north-south Conrail tracks, in Ridgefield, New Jersey, and consists of nine buildings, including administrative offices, a laboratory, and the Number 7 process building of interest.  In this building, the regulated chemicals - bromine, nitric acid, and oleum - are used in four reactors.  Although these are reactive and toxic materials, special procedures and controls are used in their handling and processing.  As a result, there have been no serious incidents involving these materials in twenty years of operation.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n     Bromine is received in tank trucks or ISO containers that are approved by the U. S. Department of Transportation, having capacities up to 45,000 pounds.  It is theoretically possible - but highly unlikely (because of the construction and safety devices) - that a container could rupture, and such an incident would be considered a \"worst-case\" scenario.  The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] requires that the consequences of such an incident be determined, as is done in this Registration Report, and this involves an estimation of the maximum number of persons who possible could be affected.\n\n     As a result of the low bromine concentration that could cause discomfort (less than one-hundreth of the life-threatening concentration), the downwind distance to which persons might be affected is significant.  The USEPA \"Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" [OCA] was used, together with a cens"

Among the features which are provided to prevent the occurrence of the \"worst-case\" incident are devices to prevent overpressurization of containers, sprinkler protection against fire exposure of containers, excess-flow shutoff valves, full-time attendance by operators during unloading, leakage detectors, remote-controlled shutoff valves, enclosure and diking of the storage tank, and systems to control temperatures, pressures, container levels, and flows.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n     The USEPA also requires that consequences of \"alternative\" release scenarios be evaluated, such as leaks from piping or other equipment and for the other regulated materials (nitric acid and oleum).  This report also presents the results of  Offsite Consequence Analysis computations and \"Landview\" census summations for these materials.  With the close control of storage, transfers, and processes, these \"alternative\" releases also are unlikely and would be stopped promptly.  As a result, it is unlikely that the public or the environment would be affected by Pfister operations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\n     Operations involving bromine, nitric acid, and oleum (sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid) are regulated by the \"Process Safety Management\" standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and by the \"Accidental Release Prevention\" standard of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency.  To comply with these standards, Pfister follows strict guidelines for operating procedures, training of employees, analysis of processes for potential hazards, preventive maintenance programs, emergency plans, and investigation of incidents, with employee participation in this process safety effort.  In addition, the Pfister facility has been involved in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act [NJTCPA] program since 1990, with annual reviews "

      "SummaryText": "of the regulated processes, annual inspections of the facility by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and with two process-safety audits by an outside consultant since that date.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n     There have been no incidents involving release of bromine, nitric acid, or oleum in the past five years.  The most-recent incident occurred on September 3, 1992, and involved the release of about 1/2 pound of bromine in a pump housing which was believed to be empty.  An employee was injured when some of the bromine entered a glove, but there were no off-site effects.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n     As a part of the NJTCPA program, the Pfister facility has conducted two emergency-response drills every year since 1990.  Many of these drills involved the Ridgefield Police and Fire Departments, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee, as well as employees who are trained to recognize and respond to the simulated emergency situation and to actuate shutdown and other protective systems.  Annual tours are arranged for members of the Fire Department, to show the locations of the unloading and storage facilities and fire protection systems.  A weather station is maintained on-site, to provide information to local authorities regarding the protection of occupants of residences and business establishments in the downwind direction.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     To provide additional containment in the trench system at the bromine and nitric acid unloading spot, the in-trench weirs are to be re-located."
