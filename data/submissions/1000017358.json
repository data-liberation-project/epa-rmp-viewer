The Rogas Facility is a Liquefied Petroleum Gasoline (LPG) and Natural Gasoline Liquids loading and unloading rail car transfer facility.  The facility operations are regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARP) and 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 Risk Management Program (RMP).  This facility meets the requirements for a PSM/RMP Program Level 3 and is covered under the Inergy Services North Coles Levee/Rogas PSM/RMP Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The facility management has implemented the prevention program described below.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Rogas facility consists of six rail spurs (215 rail car capacity) and two loading/unloading racks that can handle a total of 20 rail cars.  Rogas is connected to the Inergy North Coles Levee Fractionator via six pipelines (five Natural Gas Liquids and one Natural Gas).  \n\nIn 2004 the facility and pipelines were modernized with the addition of computer controls,  four rail spurs, and a new loading/unloading rack. In addition, all piping and transfer control devices were replaced.  The facility design standards for the modernization included the 1997 Uniform Building Code, ANSI B31.3-1996 Process Piping, NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code-2001, Federal Railroad Association, and Department of Transportation.  Fire protection upgrades are compliant with the California Fire Code and Kern County Fire Department.\n\nIn 2009/2010 the facility underwent a piping expansion by adding three additional pipelines with associated equipment between the Rogas facility and the North Coles Levee plant and the new C5+ and Butane vapor compressors at the Rogas facility.  Also, the instrument air system was upgraded and a protective enclosure was built to house the MCC.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on t"

Employee participation includes issuing Hot Work permits, reviewing and participating in hazard reviews and MOCs, conducting contractor orientations, and annually reviewing operating procedures.\n\nThe fire protection system includes a fire water storage tank, pumps, fire monitors, fire hydrants, loading rack deluge, gas detectors, and fire detection systems interlocked to shutdown the process and activate the deluge.  In addition, the process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shut off valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment and excess flow devices. The loading rack operator and truck driver are in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\nIn May 1999, an external event analysis consisting of a preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted. This walkthrough was comprised of a visual inspection of the above grade process piping and vessels. The reference used for the 1999 walkthrough were the following:\n\n1) API Standard 570 Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: Maintenance Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration.\n2) Processes Unlimited International, Inc., Engineered Safety Section, CalARP Seimic Assessment Procedures, April 12, 1999.\n3) Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, International Conference of Building Officials.\n\nThe seismic walkthrough determined that, based on the document \"Maps of Known Active Fault Near-Source Zones in California and Adjacent Portions of Nevada\", and the Uniform Building Code - 1997, this facility resides outside the boundarie"

The recommendations from this analysis were incorporated in the 2001 facility upgrade and subsequent modifications.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy has been established by Inergy management and implemented by the employees.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nInergy, L.P. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies and a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five-year accident history, which is based on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and Title 19 CCR 2735.4, shows that this facility has not had a reportable incident during the period from 2005 to 2010.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety have been established based upon the PSM/RMP compliance audits and PHA revalidations.  Recommendations from the PHAs will continue to be implemented in a timely manner based on priority established by risk assessment.  Additional training on employee responsibilities in the RMP/PSM programs, new employee orientation, emergency response, hot work permit procedures, and operating procedures will be provided.   \n\nMANAGEMENT COMMITTMENT\n\nInergy, L.P. has a commitment to employee and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements established at the facility since 1993.  Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as modernization of transfer operations, piping upgrades, training personnel "
