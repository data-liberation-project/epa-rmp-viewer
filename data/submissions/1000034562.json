It was constructed for Target Corporation; Target\n\nassumed responsibility for the building in December 2008. Prior to that date, Ryan Companies managed the\n\nconstruction, startup, daily maintenance, and operation of the facility.\n\n\n\nSince initial construction, two significant contruction projects have occurred. New banana ripening rooms were installed. Additionally, evaporators were added to an area for the storage of wet produce.\n\n\n\nTarget manages the Process Safety Management Plan in accordance to all federal, local, and state\n\nregulations.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system and other equipment is an ever\n\npresent risk to the health of team members and the community. Target is committed to safety at every level.\n\nTarget's prevention solutions include both technology as well as an active business unit that is qualified to\n\nmonitor and manage the refrigeration and PSM program.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP) are living documents,\n\ndefining the administrative and operational processes relevant to the ammonia refrigeration system. Target\n\nreserves the right to modify and adapt its PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our\n\nbusiness processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs is to minimize\n\nor eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\n\n- Human error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n- Human error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system "
