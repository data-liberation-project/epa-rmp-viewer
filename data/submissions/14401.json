Lange,  Agronomy Branch Manager\n\n       RISK  MANAGEMENT  PLAN -  EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY-\n\n   1.     The   Liquid Propane   (L.P.)   Facility  Policy;\n\n       - The owners,  management, operators and employees of LaSalle Farmers Grain Company (LSFG)\nare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Liquid Propane.  If an accidental\nrelease should occur,  the facility is prepared to work withDarfur Vol. Fire Dept. and /or other authorities\nto mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  people and the environment.\n\n\n   2.    Facility Information;\n\n       -The Primary activity at the facility is the storage , transfer and Delivery  of Liquid Propane\n(specifically for use as Dryer Fuel) as sale to farmers.\n\n       -Liquid Propane is received, stored ,abd  distributed for / as a Fuel for Corn Drying.\n\n       -the maximum quantity stored could be as high as 156,000 # in our single 30000 gal storage\n tank, \n\n       -The maximum quantity handled would be the loading of 5000 gal Delivery Truck holding 21000# or the\nunloading of a 9500 gal transport holding 34000#\n\n  3.   The Worst-Case Release scenerio and the Alternative Release scenerio.\n\n        a.  The  WORST-CASE release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.   The  maximum quantity released would be 15000#, which represents the Total volume of the storage tank at 85  percent of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is  .43 miles.\n\n        b.  The ALTERNATIVE release scenerio based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\npotential incident) is a release from a rupture in a 2\" transfer pipe. The distance to the endpoint (point of \ndispersion to  1%)  would be .3 miles  with the release of 75,800# of L"
