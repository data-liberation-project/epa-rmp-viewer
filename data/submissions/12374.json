Should an incident occur our priorities are as follows:\n\n 1.1 Life safety is the number one priority at all times.  Life safety is the group of activities that ensures that  the threat of injury to people and emergency responders is reduced to the absolute minimum.  This is most easily done by limiting the exposure of  people to danger the absolute minimum.\n                                                                                                                                                                                    1.2 Incident stabilization is the number two priority at all time.  Incident stabilization is the group of activities required to stop additional damage or danger.\n\n 1.3 Limit environmental damage is the number three priority at all times.  Limit environmental damage is the group of activities required to stop or minimize damage or danger to the environment  (air, water or ground), thus reducing long-term effects on the plant and the local community.  clean-up activities start in this phase, but may last longer than the emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n 1.4 Property conservation is the number four priority at all times.

The ether is received in railcars as a mixture of ethanol, ethyl ether and water. This material is separated into the pure components by fractional distillation. The pure ethyl ether (used mainly  in automotive starting fluid) is loaded either into tankwagons or railcars for shipment. Normally up to two railcars each containing 175,000 of ethyl ether are stored on site.\n                                                                                                                                                                                      The worst case release scenario would involve the total failure of a ethyl ether railcar (very unlikely the railcars have a design pressure rating of 100 psig and a safety relief pressure of 75 psig. The normal operating pressure in railcars is 1- 4 psig.) The EPA model indicated that a vapor cloud explosion could travel 0.4 of a mile from our railcar loading station.
