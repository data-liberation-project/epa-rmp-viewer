Vantage Corn Processors (VCP) has operational control of a Corn Dry Mill and Cogeneration facility located at Columbus, NE, and is a covered facility under the rule because three processes at the facility contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  All three of the processes meet Program Level 3 criteria.  The actual components of the required RMP include:\n\n\n\n?    Conduct a hazard assessment (release scenarios)\n\n?    Develop and implement an accident prevention program\n\n?    Develop and implement an emergency response program\n\n?    Development and implementation of a management system organizational structure\n\n?    Submittal of a RMP Plan\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release, and to minimize the consequences of any such release of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nAt VCP, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n?    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n?

The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n?    The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n \n\n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nVCP operates dry corn milling, and cogeneration facilities in Columbus, Nebraska.  Operations at the site include raw material receiving and storage, corn processing and co-product separation, product storage and shipping.  The primary products are ethanol and animal feed.  In our processes, we use two toxic chemicals and one flammable material stored in quantities greater than the EPA RMP Threshold Quantity limit.  The EPA has identified that toxic chemicals and flammable materials exceeding Threshold Quantities have the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  The three substances and quantities are identified below.\n\n\n\n    Toxics    Quantity    Threshold Quantity\n\n            \n\n1.    Chlorine    4,000 lbs.\n\n(2 - 2,000 lb. Cylinders)    2,500 lbs.\n\n2.    Ammonia (anhydrous)    48,000 gal \n\n(210,000 lbs. @ 85% Admin. Control)\n\n(4 - 12,000 gal. AST)    10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n    Flammable    Quantity    Threshold Quantity\n\n1.    Natural Gasoline\n\n(35% Pentane)    500,000 gal. AST\n\n(1 - 500,000 gal )\n\n(2,795,000 lbs.)    10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChlorine is used at the cooling towers.  Chlorine is drawn into the water stream from storage cylinders to keep a bacteria-free system.  Anhydrous ammonia can used for pH adjustment and as a nutrient in our dry mill ethanol plant, the tanks are currently out of service but remain available for service.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the cogeneration facility for the selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system, which injects ammonia into the appropriate high temperature region of the furnace/boiler for conversion of NOx to N2 and H2O.  Natural gasoline is added to ethanol in a blend tank as a denaturant."

      "SummaryText": "    The \"denatured ethanol\" contains approximately 2.5 to 5 percent natural gasoline.  The purpose of the denaturant is to classify the material as \"non-food grade\".  This material is sold as an additive to unleaded gasoline. \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.  Administrative controls, mitigation systems, and preventive measures used at VCP include:\n\n\n\n?    Chemical permit system for anhydrous ammonia storage to limit the quantity in the tank to 85 percent capacity\n\n?    High level tank alarm for filling operations\n\n?    Release sensors and alarms\n\n?    Excess flow valve/regulator (system shutdown)\n\n?    Pressure relief valves and rupture disks\n\n?    On-site emergency response team (ERT)\n\n?    Monitoring of unloading operations\n\n?    A preventative maintenance program to ensure equipment integrity and proper operation\n\n?    Standard operating procedures\n\n?    Chlorine tanks designed and operated according to Chlorine Institute Standards.\n\n?    Ammonia Tanks designed and operated according to Ammonia PSM standards.\n\n?    Pressurized vacuum flow system (system shutdown)\n\n?

This information identifies the potential hazards and the potential risks they pose.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is an evaluation of the impact of a release of a hazardous substance from a complete failure (catastrophe) of the largest vessel, releasing the entire contents over a"

The probability of a release meeting these conditions is extremely small.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at VCP's Columbus Facility is the rupture of the anhydrous ammonia outdoor aboveground storage tank and release of the entire contents (full tank = 68,000 lbs.).  The worst release would occur over a 10-minute period and the distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 4.7 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using the RMP*Comp program for Anhydrous Ammonia as well as Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-99-009). There are no mitigation measures included in this scenario.  Public and environmental receptors in this WCS include:  residences, schools, public recreational areas, commercial / industrial areas, national or state parks / forests and officially designated wildlife refuges.  The population was estimated and public receptors were identified using The EPA TRI Facility Siting tool and U.S. Census Data utilizing Marplot 4.2.4.  Environmental receptors were identified using U.S. Geological Survey Quad Maps.  Additional information regarding the WCS is included in the Registration Data Elements.\n\n\n\nThe worse-case flammable release scenario at VCP's Columbus Facility would be a vapor cloud explosion of the natural gasoline following release of the entire tank contents (2,900,000 lbs.).  The consequence distance to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch is 1.1 miles.  The distance was obtained using RMP*Comp.  There are no mitigation measures included in this scenario.  Public receptors include residences and commercial/industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the exposure distance.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) is the evaluation of the impact of a more likely release of smaller quantities of material.

Alternate toxic release scenarios have been prepared and selected for chlorine and ammonia.  An alternate flammable scenario has been prepared for natural gasoline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selected ARS for chlorine is described below.  Chlorine could be released at the facility if a one-ton chlorine cylinder valve is sheared off.  The entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 lbs.) could be released at a rate of 63.4 lbs/sec.  The release would occur inside the chlorine building.  Liquid chlorine is released which flashes immediately to vapor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 0.4 miles.  Active mitigation in this scenario includes release sensors and alarms, vacuum system shutdown, the presence of unloading personnel, and on-site Emergency Management Team (ERT) personnel and equipment.  The exposure distance was obtained using EPA Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-99-009).  Public receptors include residences and commercial / industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the exposure distance.\n\n\n\nThe selected ARS for anhydrous ammonia is described below.  Anhydrous ammonia could be released when a pressure release valve malfunctions.  Anhydrous Ammonia is released at a rate of 288 lbs. per minute for 30 minutes (8,640 lb. release).  The distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) is 0.4 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using the ALOHA 5.4.1 program for ammonia (anhydrous).
