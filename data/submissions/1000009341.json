No accidental release of anhydrous ammonia have occured at this facility in the past five years.  This is a new ammonia storage site July 2009.\n\n5.  This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Minburn Fire Department, which is a member of the Dallas County Emergency Management Agency in Iowa.  This program includes a response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency operations and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the facility by the Minburn Fire Department.\n\n6.  Changes t"
