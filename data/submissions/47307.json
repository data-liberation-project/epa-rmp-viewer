If an emergency related to the ammonia storage system were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our on-site emergency response program.\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled:  This facility manufactures silicon carbide wafers and semiconductor devices for the microelectronic and other industries.  Ammonia is used in the manufacturing process.  Ammonia is stored in 6 22,000-pound ISO tanks. Hydrogen is used in the manufacturing process.  Hydrogen is stored in two tanks with a total capacity of 13,582 lbs.\n\nAmmonia - The worst-case release scenario is the failure of one 22,000-pound tank resulting in a vapor cloud.  Using RMPCompTM, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.63 miles.  Off-site public receptors include a residential population of approximately 7458, and commercial, retail and light industrial facilities within the Research Triangle Park and the City of Durham.\n\nHydrogen - The worst-case release scenario is the failure of the 6424-pound tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using RMPCompTM, the distance to the toxic endoint is .2 miles.  Off-site public receptors include commerical, retail and light industrial facilities.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility has developed and implemented the requirements for an OSHA PSM Plan for the facility.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Cree has never had an accident involving the Bulk Ammonia or Bulk Hydrogen system that resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place. \n\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia or hydrogen storage systems, it is Cree's policy to implement our emergenc"
