      "SummaryText": "The Athens Utilities Board owns and operates the Vernon Wade Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located in Athens, Tennessee.  The system serves an estimated population of 18,784 individuals.\n\nThe WTP has a design capacity of approximately 4 MGD and utilizes chorine for disinfection.  Current chlorine management practices involve two, one-ton cylinders being stored or operated at the facility.  The two cylinders are connected with an automatic switchover device.  Chlorine is the only chemical utilized at the WTP above 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities.  There are no flammable chemicals or substances stored at the WTP.  \n\nThis facility is also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  These involve implementing operational and maintenance procedures that limit the risk of an accidental release such as those modeled in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) portion of the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP).  PSM requirements also involve working closely with local emergency response personnel to limit the consequences of an accidental release were one to occur.  \n\nThe Vernon Wade WTP has a schedule in place that requires periodic inspections of equipment used to load/unload chlorine, feed chlorine in our water treatment process, and monitor the atmosphere for chlorine leaks.  These inspections are documented by operating personnel and minimize the potential for equipment malfunctions or faulty cylinders that could lead to chlorine releases.  Operational procedures are also in place that outline specific steps to take when chlorine cylinders are loaded or unloaded, when a chlorine cylinder is placed in service, when a chlorine cylinder is removed from service, for normal operation of our chlorine process, and for emergency shutdown of our chlorine process.  These procedures minimize malfunctions and operator errors that could cause a chlorine accident.  There are also preventive maintenance procedures in place where tubing and chlorination"

      "SummaryText": " system parts are regularly replaced to minimize the potential for mechanical malfunctions that could cause chlorine releases.  \n\nAdditionally, this facility has emergency procedures in place in the event a chlorine release should occur.  These specifically outline the steps that operators, management, and administrative personnel should take when an accidental release is discovered.  Periodically, emergency drills are performed in conjunction with local emergency response agencies, like the McMinn County Hazmat team and the Athens Fire Department.  If first responders are not available to participate in emergency drills they are conducted with AUB water plant personnel.  First responders are invited to visit our facility and walk through the chlorine process area so that they can keep up with any changes to our process or procedures.  There is also an opportunity to address any concerns or questions that arise during their visit.   The latest drill was conducted at the Vernon Wade Water Treatment Plant on February 16, 2009 with AUB water plant personnel.  \n\nTraining is performed annually at the facility, where inspection, maintenance, and operational procedures are reviewed with plant operators.  Our facilityA?s emergency plan is also reviewed, along with properties of chlorine, first aid for chlorine exposure, required PPE, management of change procedures, contractor training, and accident investigation procedures.  This training serves not only to ensure our PSM operation, maintenance, and emergency response procedures are fully understood and being followed, but to identify any areas where current procedures need to be revised or new procedures implemented through communication with operating personnel.  \n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation is also conducted periodically to identify situations that could cause a chemical release and to plan specific actions that would be taken to either minimize the chances for the situation to occur or mitigate the ef"
