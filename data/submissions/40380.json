The location of the facility is 8597 Toews Road.  Planada, CA in Merced County.  This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements set forth in the Clean Air Act (CAA), Section 112 (r).  The facility contains or has the potential to contain approximately 2000 or more pounds of chlorine.  The volume of chlorine on site is normally 2000 pounds.  There are two cylinders on the site.  When one is empty the regulator is switched to another and an additional tank is ordered.  \n\nThis plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicated the possible hazard zone under the Worst Case Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario as required by the CAA and CalARP for Program 3 facilities.  These maps delineate the areas that are considered to be in the hazard zones under each scenario and the area that will need to either be evacuated or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place.  Within the zone are two population groups of concern.  There is a labor camp on E. Gerard Ave. and a public school on Childs Ave.  \n\nThe Planada Community Services District has taken numerous precautions to prevent releases of chlorine gases that could affect their employee, nearby residences or the public.  The precautions include on site alarm systems to warn employees of leaks of chlorine.  An automatic communication system that notified operators of the leak.  The operators will then relay the information to County HazMat Emergency responders.  The chlorine is stored in appropriate containers within a cement block building that has a ventilations system that can be controlled from outside the building.  The facility maintains an emergency B kit for chlorine leaks at all times.  The workers at the site are trained in the use of self-co"

All necessary parts that might be required to repair the anticipated types of leaks are available on site.  Facility employees audit the facility to maintain emergency equipment, communication equipment and their training status.\n\nThe Planada Community Services District has worked with the local emergency responders such as the Fire Department, the Police Department, the local HAZMAT group and the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) to ensure that all parties are aware of the emergency response plan and know what to do in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nPurpose:\n\n1 Protect Planada Community Services District employees, nearby residences and the public from the potential harm of uncontrolled release of chlorine both on and off the site;\n\n2. Provide information for onsite emergency responders to sue to access the hazard of a release or threatened release of chlorine;\n\n3. Establish procedures for activation of this plan and the emergency response to an uncontrolled releases; \n\n4. Comply with the requirements of Section (r) of the Clean Air Act;\n\n5.
