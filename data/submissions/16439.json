      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only material considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has one 18,000 gallon tank, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to trucks and applicators.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nWe have never had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n2. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any anhydrous line or hose breaks..\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.   We have also coordinated with the Condon Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the zone of concern from this scenario would extend 5.1 miles from our facility, and would include the city of Condon and its schools.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA\u0012s worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the zone of concern from such a release would only extend 2000 feet and would not include any residences, hospitals, schools, or commercial areas."
