The toluene diisocyanate (TDI) used in the process is the chemical covered by the Risk Management Plan requirements of 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nSenior Management is fully committed to the safety of its employees and the community.  An accidental release and emergency response program has been developed and approved by the State of Wisconsin Emergency Response Board, the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the local fire department.  \r\n\r\nAll Reiss Industries employees are trained regarding the health hazards of TDI and the appropriate respnse measures should a TDI spil occur.  Emergency response training for employees occurs at regular intervals; no less than once per year.\r\n\r\nReiss Industries has not had an accidental release of any quantity of TDI within the last five years.\r\n\r\nRegular inspections of the material handling equipment and review of procedures will continue and be improved as technology advances."
