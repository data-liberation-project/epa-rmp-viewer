      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim?s Pride Corporation?s chicken processing facility at Hinton, Virginia, a single stationary source.  The facility?s refrigeration system is a standard two-stage refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  There is approximately 33,000 pounds of ammonia on site.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy follows the National Response Team?s Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (?one plan?) and is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative release scenario?.  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is release as a gas over 10 minutes, due to and unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Pilgrim's Pride Hinton facility involves a failure of the new Pump Package Receiver under maximum storage conditions.  The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  This scenario was performed using pre-defined conditions by the EPA, namely release of the en"

The EPA-mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77?F), and average humidity (50%).  The reason this RMP is being updated is because this Pump Package Receiver is new and is larger than the vessel used for the previous worst-case scenario calculation.  Therefore, the worst-case scenario results have been changed. \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia this vessel could hold is 17,000 pounds.  Under normal operating conditions, this pump package receiver contains approximately 5600 pounds and seldom, if ever, would reach the 17,000 pound capacity. \n\n2.  Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point.  At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground. \n\n3.  Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard. \n\n4.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle. \n \nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a 250 foot, 2 inch, high pressure liquid line that runs along the roof.  Rupture could occur if corrosion weakened the pipe and some force was placed on the pipe to rupture it.  The scenario, by definition, is ?more likely to occur? than the"

The scenario we chose to evaluate does reach offsite endpoints and a few nearby public receptors.\n\nThere is no passive mitigation for either scenario.  We do, however, conduct non-destructive testing of the thickness of our pipes and vessels on a regular schedule to find any corrosion problems early and correct them as soon as possible.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n*  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners \n*  Preventative maintenance program \n*  Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners \n*  Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping \n*  Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program \n*  Procedure for handling all changes to the system \n*  Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications \n*  Up-to-date process safety information \n*  Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses \n*  Non-routine safe work permits for work on or near the ammonia process. \n \nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.

Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked on a monthly basis for timely completion as required.\n\nOnly one accidental release of ammonia causing one recordable injury has occurred at this facility in the past five years.
