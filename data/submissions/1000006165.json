This substance is used in the Mannich process to produce water treatment polymers. Substances that are used by Polychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part 68 and are above the minimum threshold quantity are as follows:\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\nDimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored as a 60 percent solution in water.  The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is 57,000 pounds (37,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\n         \n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical specific prevention steps have been developed. The key parts to the program are:  \n\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\n          Management System Responsibilities\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating\n          Recordkeeping Requirements\n          Communication and Coordination of Risk Management Information\n     DOT Hazardous Material Training\n     Contractor Performance Selection Process\n     Operating Procedures\n     Emergency Procedures\n     New Employee Environmental Health and Safety Orientation Training Program\n     Process Safety Program Auditing\n     24-hour Emergency Communications\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements for the chemical dimethylamine such as:\n\n     Mechanical Integrity - Preventive Maintenance of Equipment\n     Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n     Management of Change\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n     Incident Investigation\n\n\nEm"

The ERP has historically been coordinated with the City of Wayne LEPC and the local emergency dispatcher (i.e., 911).\n\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed.  No accidental releases from covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site or off-site; or resulted in off-site evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nSafety Improvement:\n\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Polychemie plans to periodically review the policies, procedures, and activities associated with the RMP as required by the regulations."
