LDH has installed a cryognic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation plant in Geismar.  \n\nThe Chalmette Gas Processing Plant receives Chalmette Refining's off gas in two streams.  The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas.  These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids.  The natural gas liquids are then pumped into a transmission pipeline to LDH's fractionation plant in Geismar, LA.  The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns a residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  The product is stored in a 15,000 gallon product surge tank prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\nLDH has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  The policy is supported by many programs such as compliance with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an eq"

In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.
