      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility is the following:  Mallard complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Larry Wickman who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Larry will then decide what steps to be taken in the event of an emergency.   Our facility here in Mallard is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of an anhydrous ammonia rail car when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is 160,000 pounds.    This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 16,000  pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.   According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoints is 4.4 miles.  Mallard has 2 bullet tanks and 33 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  On occasion this sight may experience 2 rail cars to be unloaded into the bullet tanks.  These rail cars will carry a maximum of 160,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per rail car.  These rail cars are spotted for a short period of time likely to be no more than 10 days.  If all storage tanks, nurse wagons, and rail cars were filled to 85% capacity total anhydrous ammonia on sight would be 727,107 lbs.  There are an estimated 523 people within this radius.  Our alternative case scenario is a transfer hose failure.  This hose failure would result in a quantity release of 5,954 pounds of anhydrous each minute for a period up to a 2 minute time period.  According to EPA lookup tables the distance to the toxic endpoint is .5 miles.   Within the radius of either scenario are schools, residences, recreation areas, and major commercial, office and industrial areas.  It is this facility's intention to co"

      "SummaryText": "mply with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator Company holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees followed by an exam.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems. Receiving ports include one-way valves to protect from product discharged during receiving.  Also within the past year we have installed steel barricades 8 feet apart around the perimeter of the bullet tanks.  These steel barricades are sunk to a depth of 4 feet below ground level and cemented for strength.  These steel barricades protrude 3 1/2 feet above ground level.  This should minimize vehicle contact with bullet tanks at the storage facility.  The bullet tanks are locked when the plant facility is closed to deter vandalism or accidental discharge of ammonia at the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Mallard Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with  the Palo Alto Disaster Coordinator and Mallard Fire Dept members.  The Mallard Fire Dept has inspected our NH3 facility.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans except as follows.  We are currently investigating the use of locking devices on nurse wagons to prevent or deter the theft of ammonia for meth labs.  We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
