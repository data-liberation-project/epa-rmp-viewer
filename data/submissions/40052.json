All KRG facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner.  It shall be the responsibility of the General Manager to ensure that all procedures are followed.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is KRG policy to immediately call the local fire departemnt and assist the agency.\n\nIt is also KRG's belief and policy to work openly with all local, state, and federal agencies for the betterment of the community and the industry.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nKern Ridge Growers, LLC (Lamont), is a grower, packer, processor, and shipper located at 8005 Wharton Avenue, Lamont, California, that uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed loop refrigerating system and gaseous Chlorine.  The refrigerant charge is 2160 pounds.  The Chlorine in stored onsite with two, one ton tanks charging the Fresh Production with Chlorine gas.  The gas is mixed with water and acts as a sanitizer.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nFor this document, two (2) separate Ammonia release scenarios are used:  the \"Worst Case\" as required by law and the \"Alternative Release\" (most likely).  The Worst Case release scenario was based on the high pressure reciever completely filled, discharging 110 pounds per minute for a peroid of 10 minutes.  Distance to the end point of 200 ppm is .87 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario was identified throuhg the What-If study preformed on June 4, 1999 at the Cal ARP/RMP class held at the Kern County Fire Department instructed by Howard Wines, III.  In an unlikely event of a release, the gas/vapor would be discharged to the atomsphere.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program:\nThe following programs and procedures have either been in place or are being implemented at the time this summary was being written.\n\nCal"
