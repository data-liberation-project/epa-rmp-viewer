In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses. There have been 4 minor incidental releases of ammonia that were discovered, documented, and repairs were made to the system. All 4 minor incidental releases were due to O-ring failures associated with solenoid valves. These small releases were documented and resolution documented as well. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Sysco - Riverside facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nSysco - Riverside maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and a"

All relief valves in the engine room are piped to a common header, which vents to the ammonia diffusion tank.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sysco - Riverside ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The maintenance activities and schedules were developed by, and are performed by, an outside ammonia refrigeration maintenance contractor. \n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 2009 Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to an ammonia diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Sysco - Riverside has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs"

Compressors C4 and C5 pull low stage suction from the -15F Recirculator with side port suction from the +15F Recirculator. Compressor C6 pulls suction from the -30F Accumulator. At these Compressors, the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased through the discharge port of the machines.  Compressors C1 - C5 then send high pressure discharge vapor to the Condensers.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.  The facility was constructed and began operations in 2013.   \n\nThe primary business of Sysco - Riverside is to provide cooling and storage of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility refrigeration system has a maximum intended inventory of 21,816 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. For the purposes of this registration, the maximum intended inventory was rounded to 22,000 lbs. of ammonia.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration.
