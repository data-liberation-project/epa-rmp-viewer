Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at United Farmers Co-op in Norseland are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the St. Peter Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\n\nexpertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Norseland (Figure 1).  The maximum\n\namount stored is 57,800 gallons (297,439 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85% including\n\nthe capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains\n\n78,734 pounds at 85 % maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\n\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (78,734 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  We\n\nanticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. At Class F\n\natmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban to"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 1.5 miles2 x\n\n3.14 x 75 people = approximately 530  people within 1.5 mile radius of the site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n\n2,500 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\n\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.4 mile (Figure 3).

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\n\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\n\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\n\nidentified and controlled effectively.

These procedures address various modes of operation; the\n\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n\n(Appendix B).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\n\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\n\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\n\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\n\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\n\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\n\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at United Farmers Co-op to manage changes in process chemicals,\n\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\n\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\n\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\n\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\n\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\n\nequipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\n"
