(Scholzen) that is regulated by the EPA 112[r]. Scholzen receives, stores, and ships chlorine gas in standard, 22 liter, pressurized cylinders to various customers within the area. Each cylinder contains about 150 lbs. of chlorine at high pressure and Scholzen's peak inventory may approach 50 cylinders for a total of 7500 lbs. of chlorine.\nAs required by EPA, Scholzen has evaluated the consequences of a worst-case release(postulated but highly unlikely) and an alternative release (a less conservative estimate) involving the accidental release of chlorine gas from a cylinder into the. atmosphere. The worst case assumes the entire release of 150 lbs. of chlorine within 10 minutes from a cylinder located in the Scholzen warehouse. Using the conservative estimates given in EPA's OCA Guidance, a worst case release impacts an area of diameter of 0.3 miles (less than 1600 feet) from the point of release. The alternative release scenario impacts an area of diameter of less than 0.1 miles (about 500 feet). Only a few private residences and a local motel (for the worst case scenario only) are impacted by these release scenarios. Scholzen has experienced no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five year reporting period as required by EPA and no member of the public or Scholzen workers have ever been injured from a chlorine accident at the Scholzen Warehouse in Hurricane, Utah.\n\nScholzen has developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program comprised of trained personnel, safety equipment, emergency and medical plans and resources, and procedures to address safety issues regarding its possession of chlorine. This Risk Management Program meets all local, state, and federal regulations and industrial safety standards including those of EPA and OSHA.\n\nThe Scholzen Products Company Risk Management Plan includes the following el"
