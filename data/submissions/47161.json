Storing a large quantity of chlorine can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  The Yuma Desalting Plant is owned and operated by the Bureau of Reclamation.  As such, it takes its safety obligations in storing and using chlorine seriously.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps the Bureau of Reclamation takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Yuma Desalting Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation recognizes the responsibility to make its environment, community and employee safety a primary part of our daily concerns.  The Bureau of Reclamation is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  The Bureau of Reclamation is dedicated to developing an environmentally responsible energy resource compatible with community needs.   The prevention of accidents and protection of its employees, property and the general public are essential to the efficient and successful completion of every project undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau of Reclamation requires active injury and illness prevention as an important element of production on a daily basis.\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Ai"

This document summarizes the Bureau of Reclamation\u00bfs existing health and safety programs, its internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Yuma Desalting Plant Authority has prepared an emergency action plan (called the Continuity of Operations Plan) to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Yuma Desalting Plant is located at 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona in the southwest corner of Arizona near the California and Mexico borders.  The YDP is located in the northwest quarter of Yuma, immediately south of Cocopah R.V. and Golf Resort and adjacent to the Arizona Public Service Yucca Power Plant.\n\nThe WQIC and production plant use the chlorine systems to provide a chlorine solution as a disinfecting agent.  This disinfecting step is necessary to promote the destruction of algae, bacteria, micro-organisms. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at Yuma Desalting Plant exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.  The anhydrous chlorine process is a Program 3 process.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nYuma Desalting Plant is in compliance with federal Process Safety Management requirements. Yuma Desalting Plant\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nDetailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\nComprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\nComprehensive preventive maintenance program.\nPerformance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and re"
