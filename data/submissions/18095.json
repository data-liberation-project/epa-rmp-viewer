      "SummaryText": "storage tank containing hydrochloric acid with no mitigation assumed.  The release has off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided software (RMP*Comp).  \n\n This release is highly unlikely due to the tank's materials of construction, periodic vessel inspections, and available de-inventorying capacity in the case of an emergency.\n\n Worst-case Flammable Release Scenario\n\n The worst-case flammable release scenario for the Washington Works site involves the release of ethylene from a tube trailer. The release has off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided guidance documents and equations.  Based on the results and location of the tube trailer, no residences are within the area of impact.\n\n The release of the tube trailer contents is highly unlikely due to the design and inspection of the tube trailer in accordance with DOT regulations, the materials of construction for the transfer piping, and gas detection with early warning signals.\n\n Alternative Toxic Release Scenarios\n\n There are three alternative toxic release scenarios for the Washington Works site.  The chemicals involved include hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, and chlorine. The scenarios use the best engineering judgement as to a more likely scenario for the processes involved with no mitigating factors to minimize their impact.  The meteorological conditions are those given in the EPA Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual for alternate release scenarios.  All scenarios have off-site impact as determined by the EPA guidance manual tables and RMP*Comp software.\n\nFor chlorine, the release involves shearing off a discharge valve on a cylinder.\n\nFor formaldehyde, the release involves release of material via a safety relief device due to high pressure that subsequently becomes stuck open.\n\nFor hydrochloric acid, the release involves the failure of a transfer hose on a shipping trailer.\n\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario\n\n The alternative flammable release scenario developed for the Wash"

No deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, and no deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage off site occurred as a result of this release.\n\nThe release occurred due to a lightning strike that caused power to be lost in one of the manufacturing areas on our site. Because of the uncertain movement of the release due to the shifting winds, the local alert system was sounded as a precautionary measure.  Since previous communications with our community requested that individuals shelter-in-place upon hearing the alert system, it is assumed this action was taken by some within the area, but there are no documented cases.\n\n Investigation into the incident occurred and recommendations to prevent recurrence were documented.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n The Emergency Response program in place at Washington Works is such that plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases.  The program can be summarized as follows:\n\n-Training and preparation\n  -Plant personnel and emergency responders receive emergency response training.\n  -Emergency response plans are current.\n  -The plant conducts periodic emergency drills, including critiques.\n  -A plant representative actively participates on the Washington and Wood Counties Local\n    Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs).\n\n-If a release with the potential for off-site impact occurs:\n -The plant emergency alarm is sounded.\n -The pl"

All of these are monitored to ensure they remain current.  \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n Making our processes safer is an on-going program at Washington Works.  Employee suggestions, capital improvements, audit programs, and various other activities ensure that we provide safe, reliable processes. Other programs aimed at improving process safety and our emergency response planning include:\n\n-Recommendations defined during cyclic process hazards analyses that reduce or eliminate the\n risks associated with our processes.\n -Training of technical personnel in Inherently Safer Process Technology.\n -Improved exchange of information and communication with our LEPCs."
