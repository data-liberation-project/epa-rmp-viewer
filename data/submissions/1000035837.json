(Synergy Liquids) is submitting this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transloading facility in Three Rivers, Live Oak County, Texas.\n\n\n\n1.1 ?68.155(a): Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids is committed to operating and maintaining the LPG transloading operations in a safe and responsible manner. A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency action planning will be used to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of the employees as well as the citizens of the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Synergy Liquids will implement, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of the facility and the substances regulated by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 that are currently handled on-site in stationary sources above their corresponding threshold quantities;\n\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\n- A five-year accident history for significant accidental releases from processes covered by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n- An overview of the emergency response programs; and\n\n- An overview of improvements at the facility implemented to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting the employees, the public, the environment, and company assets.\n\n\n\n1.2 ?68.155(b): Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids has executed an agreement to utilize the existing rail spur at the Three Rivers Oilfield Service Center located at 3077 S. Hwy 37 Access, Three Rivers, Texas, for the proposed transloading facility.  The proposed operations will include the transloading of LPG (e.g., mixed butane) from railcars to tanker trucks or vice versa.

Transloading operations will be performed by a third-party carrier on behalf of Synergy Liquids; there will be no permanent Synergy Liquids employees located on-site.   \n\n\n\nThe LPG is a mixture of propane, propylene, and butanes (i.e., i-butane and n-butane). These chemicals have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of substantial accidental releases:\n\n\n\nRegulated Flammable Substances:\n\n\n\nPropane (CAS Number 74-98-6);\n\nPropylene (CAS Number 115-07-1);\n\ni-Butane (CAS Number 75-28-5); and\n\nn-Butane (CAS Number 106-97-8).\n\n\n\n1.4 ?68.155(c): Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of flammable substances.  Synergy Liquids has developed a written procedure that lists the conditions and guidelines for safely transloading mixed LPGs from an LPG rail car to an LPG tank truck or vice versa.  This procedure will be followed by the third-party carrier who actually performs the transloading on behalf of Synergy Liquids.  \n\n\n\nMixed LPGs are liquefied flammable gases transported under pressure.  All ignition sources in the vicinity of the transloading operations will be eliminated prior to executing the transloading procedure. \n\n\n\n1.5 ?68.155(d): Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOperation of the Three Rivers LPG Transloading Facility will begin in 2013; therefore, there have been no accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.6 ?68.155(e): Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids has coordinated emergency response activities with the Three Rivers Volunteer Fire Department.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, the transloading operator will notify other operators in the vicinity, dial 911 to alert the local Fire Department and call the Three Rivers Oilfield Service Center Operati"
