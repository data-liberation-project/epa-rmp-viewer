The facility is adjacent to the Mississippi River at Mile Point 80.   The facility receives, stores, and transfers a wide variety of bulk liquid materials including food grade oils, fuels, solvents, and industrial chemicals.  Bulk products are stored in aboveground storage tanks surrounded by secondary containment diked sized to contain a complete failure of the largest tank and rainfall associated with the 25 year, 24 hour storm event within the containment area.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nStolthaven New Orleans, LLC is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. \nEmployees involved in operating the acrylonitrile handling facility are trained to identify and understand the hazards posed during the storage and transfer process.  Training includes the review of information pertaining to the hazards of acrylonitrile, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures. The facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in handling acrylonitrile to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  Written training information includes the physical properties of acrylonitrile, the health risks associated with chemical exposures, and material safety data sheets.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled \n\nStolthaven handles more than the threshold quantities of acrylonitrile (20,000 pounds). Stolthaven is regulated under the Program 2 requirements of 68.10.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program  \n\nStolthaven??A?s accidental release prevention program includes all the elements required under Part 68 Subpart C including, Safety Information 68.48; Hazard Review 68.50; Operating Procedures 68.52; Training 68.54; Maintena"
