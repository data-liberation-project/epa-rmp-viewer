The facility is included in the community emergency response plan. Their role is to immediately call 911, Plant Manager and Maintenance Supervisor\nwhile waiting for the Fire Department and appropriate responders to arrive at the scene. The rest of\nthe employees are to be evacuated from the facility to a designated area. The Fire Department and\nappropriate responders will take over the role as Incident Commander upon arrival.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMitigation measures to prevent accidents involving anhydrous ammonia include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The facility's PSM team is planning to meet periodically, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes may include the following items:\n\n1.            Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n2.            Continue to have employee involvement in program development.\n3.            Continue employee involvement through safety"
