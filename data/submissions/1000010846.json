              "Description": "Blowing agent (n-Pentane) employed in RMAX's foam manufacturing process is flammable according to the definition contained in A?1910.1200(c). RMAX's Dallas Operation may have up to 66,470 pounds of Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent present in its process at any one time. This is above the applicability threshold of 10,000 pounds, as established in A?1910.119(a)(1)(ii). Thus, RMax has determined its Dallas, Texas facility is subject to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119. Through preparation of the Risk Management Program / Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM), RMAX has determined that its Dallas Operation is aProgram 3 process as defined by 40 CFR 68.10(d). This determination is based on the results of the worst-case release scenario for n-Pentane, the location of public receptors being within the distance to the endpoint (as presented in the scenario modeling results), and the applicability of 29 CFR 1910.119 to the facility. \n\nRMAX has defined its covered process as that equipment which contains or contacts the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent starting at the bulk storage tank loading (or fill) connection and extending up to and including the mix heads (located at the Pour Table). This determination was made based on the fact that once the Blowing Agent is mixed with the other foam components; it is no longer a liquid and is part of a solid, non-flammable product. \n\nRMax has developed and implemented written procedures which ensure that its employees have been made aware of and are actively involved in the development of the information comprising its RMP/PSM Plan, including the process hazard analysis. For all PHAs conducted by RMax, the PHA Team will be made up of at least the following personnel: Plant Manager; Process Engineer/Plant Engineer; Employee(s) with responsibility for receiving/supervising unloading of Blowing Agent; Chemical Mix Operator; Pour Table Operator; Maintenance Personnel; and, other Person(s) with a knowledge of the PHA methodology. \n\nA recommendation that is a result of a PHA conducted by RMax will be addressed as soon as practicable. For each recommendation, a documentation form will be completed. This form will list the specific recommendation and will: assure that the recommendation is resolved in a timely manner; document what actions are to be taken; develop a written schedule for the completion of required activities; assure that information required to be communicated to affected employees is done so; and, verify (by RMax Plant Manager) that the recommendation has been completed. RMax's PHA is updated and/or revalidated at least every five (5) years after the completion of its initial PHA. Also, any time there is a change in process equipment, raw materials, or method of operation, the PHA will be updated. \n\nAll work on the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent system is performed by RMax Maintenance and/or the equipment manufacturer personnel. These personnel are fully informed of the potential fire and explosion release hazards related to the system. RMax ensures ontractors have completed appropriate safety orientations and training prior to the commencement of work. These actions fulfill the contractor safety requirements set forth in OSHAs PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119(h)) and EPAs RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.87). \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.79 and 29 CFR 1910.119(o), RMax has implemented a compliance audit program to verify that the procedures, practices, and process controls contained in its RMP/PSM Plan are adequate and properly implemented. A compliance audit is conducted by RMax at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119. More frequent audits may be conducted at the discretion of the Plant Manager, or if it is determined that more frequent audits are necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations. As a requirement for implementing a Level 3 program, RMAX has implemented an Emergency Action Plan for release response, emergency notification, facility shut down and evacuation, medical response, fire/explosion, and post incident follow up.",

This commitment is a critical element of the facility's RMP/PSM Plan. It will extend not only through the initial development of the plan, but will endeavor to incorporate the practices and procedures established by this plan into the facility's normal way of conducting day-to-day business. RMAX has established a management system to oversee the development, implementation, and successful continuing implementation of its RMP/PSM Plan. The goals of this system are:\n\n- Clarify the roles and responsibilities related to process safety issues at the facility;\n- Avoid problems or conflicts among the various people responsible for implementing elements of the risk management plan;\n- Avoid confusion and allow those responsible for implementation to work together as a team;\n- Ensure that the program elements are integrated into an ongoing approach to identifying hazards and managing risks;\n- Ensure effective communication about process changes; and,\n- Provide full compliance to all regulatory requirements.\n\nThe overall implementation of the RMP/PSM Plan is the responsibility of the Plant Manager. Under this plan, it is his duty to ensure all elements are ultimately implemented as described. Although other employees will have key roles in the RMP/PSM Plan, the Plant Manager assumes this overall responsibility.\n\nIt is in the best interest of RMAX and RMAX employees to continually evaluate potential safety issues. Should any employee find any area or practice to be a potential safety hazard, let your supervisor know. Do not wait for someone to ha"

Entry to confined spaces will be permitted only after proper training has been conducted.   Our employees are not permitted to enter a bulk chemical tank. \nIt is also our policy to prevent chemical spills by maintaining our chemical handling equipment, chemical storage tanks, chemical transfer lines, and containment walls, in excellent condition. \n\nPolicy: In the case of a Major Chemical Spill our employees will immediately evacuate the facility. Our employees will not attempt to assist in the clean-up of a major chemical spill. In the unlikely event the containment wall fails to restrict a chemical spill, RMAX certified HAZMAT technicians may be asked to place absorbent barriers in the flow path of the spilled chemical. However, RMAX employees will not be asked to make contact with hazardous spilled chemicals.       \n \nFacility & Regulated Substances Handled\n\nRMAX, Dallas Operations manufactures polyisocyanurate foam insulating board (foam board). The facility operates under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 32615 (Urethane and other foam (except polystyrene) manufacturing). The foam board produced at the facility is used in both residential and commercial construction applications. RMAX produces foam board in thickness ranging from A? inch to 4.5 inches.\n\nRMAX uses three main raw materials in the production of foam board: Methylenebis Di-Phenylisocyanate (MDI), Polyol, and Blowing Agent (n-Pentane).  Several catalysts and fire retardants may also be used depending upon the type of foam board being produced. MDI is considered as part A and Polyol combined with catalyst and surfactants are considered as a part B.   \n\nThe main raw materials are all liquids and are stored on-site in bulk tanks sized at 12,000 gallons.

Once parts A and B are combined the liquids exothermically react to form solid foam. \nn-Pentane (CAS No: 109-66-0) is a substance regulated by 40 CFR 68 [EPAs Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions]. Taking into account A?68.115(b)(2)(i), RMAX has determined the total quantity of n-Pentane in its foam board manufacturing process (for purposes of a threshold quantity determination) to be the total amount of the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent present in its process at any one time. The maximum amount present in RMAX's foam board manufacturing process at any one time is 66,470 pounds. This is above the threshold quantity for n-Pentane of 10,000 pounds, as established in A?68.130. Therefore, RMAX has determined that the Dallas facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for n-Pentane. \n\nRMAX has defined its covered process as that equipment which contains or contacts the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent starting at the bulk storage tank loading (or fill) connection and extending up to and including the mix heads (located at the Pour Table).

The program provided a conservative estimate for the distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure. The quantity of n-Pentane used in the worst case release scenario analysis for RMAX's Dallas, Texas facility has been determined to be the amount of Blowing Agent contained in the facility's on-site bulk storage tank. In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(e), for purposes of calculating the distance to the worst case release endpoint, RMAX has assumed that the entire contents of the single largest vessel containing Blowing Agent (66,470 pounds) is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, and that 10% of the released quantity participates in the resulting explosion. \n\nRMAX has determined the maximum threat distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure using RMPComp is 0.3 miles for a release quantity of 66,470 pounds of Blowing Agent.  Using U.S. Census Data for 2000 and an aerial map, it is estimated there is no residential population within a 0.3 mile radius.
