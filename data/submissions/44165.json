The diked area also contains 6 inches of water to serve as a water blanket should a release occur. Cs2 weighs approximately 10.5 lbs per gallon and is only slightly water soluable. This water blanket will contol vapors reducing the chances of fire or explosion. There is a 15 lb nitrogen blanket on the Cs2 storage tank 24/7. The nitrogen system is equipped with a low pressure alarm. If nitrogen pressure drops below 5 PSI an audible alarm will sound alerting everyone of the potential problem. There are inventory controls in place to ensure that there are no more than 63, 000 lbs ( 6,000 Gallons ) in the tank at any time. The storage tank is also situated on load cells to assist with the inventory control. The tank truck unloading area is a concrete pad with secondary containment to contain any release. The tanker unloading area is equipped with bonding and grounding straps to eliminate static electricty.
