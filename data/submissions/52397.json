Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MarkWest Energy Appalachia, LLC (MarkWest) - Siloam facility located in South Shore, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Greenup County, Kentucky and Scioto County, Ohio Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses processing, storage, and wholesale distribution of various liquified petroleum gases (LPGs).  The following LPGs are present at the facility: propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes), and mixed feed natural gas liquids (a combination of all the previously mentioned LPGs commonly referred to as Y-grade).  All of these substances are regulated due to their flammable and explosive nature.  \n\n\n\nThe facility receives the mixed feed Y-grade from pipeline, tank truck, and rail car.  The Y-grade is stored in above ground vessels and then processed at the facility into propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline.  These products are stored in both above ground vessels and also, in the case of propane and normal butane, in underground caverns.\n\n\n\nThese products are then distributed from the facility by tank truck, rail car, and, in the case of normal"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
