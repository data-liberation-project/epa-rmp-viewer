Torrey Canyon Road dead-ends into Guiberson Road at the entrance to the facility.  The facility is relatively remote and bounded by private property on the south and southeast and citrus groves on the northeast.  A dry creek wash (Torrey Canyon Wash) is located along the northeast boundary of the facility. \r\n\r\nThe SCVG Plant consists of one Program 3 process, which utilizes several operations to produce natural gas and natural gas liquids product.  Two gas streams come into the plant from local oil production fields and enter separate gas scrubbers, then flow through three compressor skids where the gas is compressed to the Southern California Gas Company specifications.  The gas is cooled and sent through the turbo expander where gasoline, butane, and propane are separated out of the process stream and sent to a pressure vessel for storage before custody transfer.  The natural gas from the process is dry gas, which is sold to a public utility.\r\n\r\n1.3  Regulated Substances\r\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities establish by this regulation.\r\n\r\n1.4  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant is subject to RMP requirements as well as OSHA\u00bfs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM)"

The Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant, by complying with the PSM and RMP standards, has im-plemented all of the requirements of the RMP Program 3 prevention program.\r\n\r\nCompliance with PSM\u00bfs comprehensive program ensures the operating integrity of the plant processes that handle flammable materials.  The objective of the company\u00bfs PSM program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.  To control these types of hazards, VPC has proactively identified, evaluated and developed operating and main-tenance procedures to prevent, or at least mitigate, the release of chemicals due to fail-ures in the process or equipment.  VPC relies on its workforce expertise, experience, judgment and training to properly implement and maintain the PSM program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process.  Using this approach the following components were considered in the evaluation: 1) the process chemicals; 2) process technology; 3) process equipment; 4) operations and maintenance activities and procedures; 7) training programs; and 8) other elements that affect the process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the de-sign and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemi-cals have been evaluated and tested to assure their effectiveness at each level. \r\n\r\n1.5  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to implementing the PSM elements, the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant utilizes specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control or releases of regulated (and other) substances.  The Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant utilizes control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials.  This equipment includes:\r\n\u00bf\tRelief and/or safety valves;\r\n\u00bf\tFlare system\r\n\u00bf\tHigh temperature alarms and/or shutdowns;\r\n\u00bf\tFlame detectors;\r\n\u00bf\tCombustible Gas Detectors;\r\n\u00bf\tFire Protection System;"

VPC adheres to written operating procedures to protect its employees, environment, property, and the general public from any off-site impacts that could occur as a result of operations at the plant.  VPC operates its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations, which serves to reinforce its long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at their facilities.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, building safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  The VPC philosophy is to implement engineering and administrative controls to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances, as well as non-regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe VPC SCVGP Emergency Action Plan relies on local emergency responders and emergency response agencies in case of an incident. Agencies in conjunction with plant personnel are expected to respond to the hazards of a chemical release and employ procedures to mitigate the release of such chemicals to the environment.  The highest priority in an emergency response is for the safety of responding emergency personnel as well as affected and non-affected personnel.  Emergency procedures are implemented according to what is appropriate based on a hazard assessment performed at the scene of the incident.  VPC will always attempt to have an Incident Command structure in place to assist emergency response personnel in the immediate control of any release.  Priorities for response are based on life, environment and property, in that order.\r\n\r\nManagement supports plant safety by means of periodic visits to the plant by management personnel, and by stationing a qualified operator on-site during"
