This is accomplished to a great extent by a well developed, up-to-date and implemented Risk Management Program. All USCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is USCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All USCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\n\n\n\nUnited States Cold Storage, Lumberton is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed loop system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor and is commonly familiar to most people due to the fact that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span in the environment of 7 days before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\n\n\nTypical items stored within USCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in any supermarket and restaurant. Temperatures ranges between -30 degrees to +45 degrees F. Most of the refrigeration equipment is located inside the facility. There are a couple exceptions, the condensers and piping on the machine room roof and the piping to and from the freezers, coolers, truck and rail docks are located on the warehouse roof. In an unlikely event of a refrigerant leak in any refrigerated space, the ammonia vapor would be co"

The machine room contains most of the large refrigeration machinery and vessels. The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout to help lessen any leaks that might occur and to provide an early alert.\n\n\n\nUSCS believes that prevention is foremost. All USCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration(IIAR).USCS has on staff at the corporate level a Regulatory Compliance and Safety Manager who is a certified Safety Professional by Board of Certified Safety Professionals. All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\n\n\nThe USCS Lumberton facility has been operating at this location for the past 25 years. Within that long history the facility has seen few refrigerant releases. Since June, 2004, this facility has not experienced any accidents or releases from their refrigeration system(s) that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or offsite, deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for 29 CFR 1910.38-Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's 1910.119, Process Safety Management and 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response  plan.\n\n\n\nThe PHA revalidation recently performed for this facility produced 3 recommendations to improve safety. The first PHA produced 13 recommendations to improve safety at the Lumberton facility. Such changes included installation of new mitigation and/or controls"
