      "SummaryText": "1   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBaskin Robbins is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, we rely upon the able assistance of the Vernon Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team.\n\n\n2  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ice cream.  The plant is located at 2522 East 37th Street in Vernon, California.  We have one RMP-regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is approximately 24,000 lb.\n\n\n3  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and EPA Model RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nConsequence modeling was conducted to determine the release distances from the site. \n\nThe worst-case release scenarios represent a release of the largest vessel's contents when full over a 10-minute release period. The scenario involves the release of 10,500 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Release distances were calculated using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, and toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  Results for the WCS were modeled"

      "SummaryText": " using EPA's RMP-Comp based on a toxic gas release that has been liquefied under pressure, and is located in an enclosed space. The largest vessel is located in an enclosed area, the engine room. The walls of the engine room are considered passive mitigation, and reduce the release rate to the atmosphere outside the building.  For a release of a toxic gas in an enclosed space, RMP-Comp assumes that the rate of release to the atmosphere is 55% of the release rate if the release were happening outdoors.\n\nThe alternative scenario consists of an ammonia release from an oil drain valve that was inadvertently left open. The pipe diameter is 3/4\". The scenario involves a release rate of 635 lbs./minute.
