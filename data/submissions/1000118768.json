This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  The Arena terminal is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nFacility and Product Description\n\nThe Andersons Arena Facility receives bulk shipments and re-loads distribution trucks with propane.  This facility implemented this process in the Fall of 2019.  The facility is situated in an agricultural setting and is located approximately 3 miles west of the town of Arena, Wisconsin, Arena Township, Iowa County.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is propane.  Propane is an extremely flammable colorless gas and can travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back to the leak. Propane is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.  Propane is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  Two tanks are used for bulk storage of propane.    To fill the tanks, propane rail cars are offloaded via loading stations from the rail cars and into the large storage tanks.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Andersons has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Andersons maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nComprehensive analyse"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures\nTo ensure safe operations, The Andersons  maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at The Andersons to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at The Andersons. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits \nThe Andersons conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Andersons believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, The Andersons employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit\nThe Andersons has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nPreventive maintenance (PM) is an integral piece of this hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and piping are inspected at least monthly and documented using a PM database.  All hose and valve replacements are documented in the PM database.  Records of major maintenance tasks performed on the tank or related equipment are saved in the PM database.\n \nTraining\nEmployees receive training on propane safety, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP), and Hazard Communication Program.  Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.  Training is performed with all employees annually and within 90 days of employment.\n\nContractors\nPrior to performing work contractors are pre-screened and evaluated, and if approved, receive a contractor safety review prior to performing work at the facility.  During this review, they are informed of any potential hazards at the facility, emergency procedures, site-specific safety rules, and the ability to request an SDS for any product at any time.\n\nIncident Investigation\nFormal investigations are performed for all environmental or safety incidents.  Documentation is kept on file at the facility and the Corporate Safety Department.\n\nFacility safety training / meetings allow employees to discuss any concerns they may have with the operation of the facility.

All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated.  Once the response team has arrived, the facility will work with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak.  \n\nThe facility employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order:  911, the facility manager, the Corporate Safety Department and Group Safety emergency phone numbers, the appropriate Federal and State of Wisconsin agencies.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the both the facility Spill Control and Emergency Response Plans.  \n\nCommunication Procedures with Emergency Responders\n\nThe Fire Department, LEPC, and State Regulatory Agencies receive a copy of the hazardous materials storage information, annually, in accordance with community right to know obligations.  A copy of the Arena Facility's EAP is on file with the Local Fire Department.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Arena facility has not had a propane release in the last five years.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Andersons is continually working with management and employees to improve safety at the terminal. The Andersons has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
