Box 2188\nScottsbluff, NE 69361\n\nFor further information contact: Don Hickox, Safety Coordinator\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Scottsbluff)\n\nThe management and employees of Panhandle Cooperative Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. \n\nIn the event of an emergency Panhandle Coop would dial 911 immediately and work with the local fire department or other authorities.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years. .  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38.  We also provide state and local authorities the emergency and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nAnnual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, emergency response, and the use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.  We also have frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n\nAnnual inspections by the State Fire Marshal include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  We perform periodic evaluations to assess the maintenance of safe"
