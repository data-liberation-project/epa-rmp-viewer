(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equalizer, Inc.) owns and operates a fertilizer facility near Hastings, Nebraska which is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  \n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires a facility which handles threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to develop a program (if one is not already in existence) to prevent accidental releases of these substances and to minimize the consequences of those releases that do occur.  This Risk Management Program is to include a management system, a hazard assessment to identify the possible offsite impacts of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, a five-year accident history record, an accidental release prevention program, an emergency response program and a Risk Management Plan which summarizes the entire program and is submitted to the EPA.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility located near Hastings in south central Nebraska, serves as a storage and distribution terminal for fertilizer products.  \n\nThe Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility serves as a vital link in the fertilizer distribution system by receiving products from manufacturing plants, by storing the products until they are needed and by distributing the products primarily in the area of south central and southwestern Nebraska.  Being centrally located, the facility provides a convenient location for fertilizer retailers to get their product.  Additionally, Equalizer Midwest, Inc. is committed to being a solid, reliable member of the Hastings community.  \n\nEqualizer Midwest, Inc. has 12 full-time employees, with a total of more than 100 years of combined operating experience.

The employees recognize that community involvement and volunteerism are the most effective way to improve the communities they live in.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility that is subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule.  The anhydrous ammonia is primarily received by rail and shipped by truck and is stored as a refrigerated liquid at ambient pressure and also as a liquid under pressure.  A refrigeration system is utilized in support of the storage of the liquid at ambient pressure and various vessels and piping serve in the transfer of ammonia within the process.   Ammonia heaters are utilized to raise the temperature of the refrigerated liquid from   -28 degrees F to 35 degrees F, as required for the loading of ammonia transports.  The anhydrous ammonia distributed from this facility is used almost exclusively as an agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe facility was originally designed and constructed to be an anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant and was operated as such from startup in 1962 until 1985, at which time the manufacturing process was discontinued.  Since 1985, the facility has functioned strictly as a terminal for anhydrous ammonia, utilizing the storage and transfer infrastructure of the original manufacturing plant.  Also, since 1985, changes including additions and improvements have resulted in the current design and operation of the terminal.  Farmland Industries, Inc. owned and operated the facility from 1962 until 2003.  In June of 2003, the facility was purchased by Equalizer, Inc. of Waco, Texas, which subsequently established the ownership and operation of the facility under Equalizer Midwest, Inc.\n\nAccidental Re"

Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of the facility, to the safety of its employees and to the safety of the general public.  Consequently, the management and employees of the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.\n\nThe Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility has a written Emergency Response Plan - as required by the RMProgram and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules - and is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local emergency response agencies.   Personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding activities at the facility and emergency response issues.\n\nEmployees are trained in the implementation of the plan and appropriate response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nAs a handler of anhydrous ammonia, the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29CFR 1910.119, in addition to the RMProgram rule.  Under the RMProgram rule, the handling of ammonia at the facility is characterized as a Program 3 process, requiring a Program 3 Prevention Program.

According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked but that the distance to an endpoint estimated under the worst-case scenario should not be considered a ?public danger zone?.\nPossible causes or the improbability that such a release may occur are not considered.\n\nEPA has defined the alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nAs previously mentioned, anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility that is subject to the RMProgram rule and, therefore, to the requirements for hazard assessment.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nOwing to the seasonal nature of the use of anhydrous ammonia as an agricultural fertilizer, to the limited rate at which this product can be received and to the fact that the demand for this product during the ?season? can be very great over a relatively short time span, an inventory of anhydrous ammonia must be available at the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility for when it is needed.\n\nThe largest vessels at the facility for the storage of anhydrous ammonia are the refrigerated liquid storage tanks within which the liquid ammonia is maintained at ambient pressure.  Therefore, the hypothetical worst-case release scenario for this location is assumed to involve the catastrophic failure of one of these tanks.  And, as required by the rule, the worst-case release scenario also assumes that the entire storage tank content is released as a gas in 10 minutes.

In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of the process and storage tanks, including these, and largely preclude such an unlikely failure.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nA more reasonably likely release event than the worst-case scenario, but which is still hypothetical, can be envisioned as occurring in the facility areas where anhydrous ammonia is handled regularly, e.g. in the loading and unloading areas.  Since the RMProgram rule does not require the use of a catastrophic vessel failure for the alternative release scenario and since the rule does allow for the consideration of active mitigation measures such as system shutdown safeguards (which are located throughout the facility) and operator intervention to mitigate and limit the consequences of an accidental release, the release rates and total release amounts for alternative release scenarios are generally significantly lower than those of worst-case release scenarios.  Thus, the alternative release scenario could include such an event as an ammonia transfer line or hose failure, the lifting of a safety relief valve, a seal failure on an ammonia transfer pump or etc.\n\nThe hypothetical alternative release scenario for the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility is assumed to involve a break in a four inch ammonia transfer line.  The distance to the endpoint for this release was determined with the DEGADIS model, i.e. a publicly available model which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with ammonia release events.
