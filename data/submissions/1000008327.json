The area immediately surrounding the plant is primarily rural with just a few commercial facilities and residential areas.  The Androscoggin River is the closest water body and is directly adjacent to the plant.  The major routes serving the facility include U.S. Route 2 and Maine Route 108. \nThe only process at the Rumford Mill facility covered by RMP is the chlorine dioxide process which involves the manufacture, storage, and distribution of a 1.2 % solution of chlorine dioxide.  Based on a review of chemicals present at the plant, there are no other substances that are covered by RMP.\nPursuant to the RMP rule, owners must include a five-year accident history that identifies all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in: (1) deaths, OSHA reportable injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or (2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  See 40 C.F.R. A!A? 68.42. A review was completed for all existing RMP covered chemical release/spill records and incident investigation reports dating back to June 2004.  No accidental releases from covered processes at the mill meeting the criteria described above have occurred within the past five years.\nThe Rumford Mill is committed to the safety and health of Rumford workers and the public, preservation of the environment, and prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Rumford; and programs to evaluate the hazards throughout the facility.\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Rumford Mill attempts to co"

The Rumford Mill provides response training to mill personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department and with the LEPC.\nThe Rumford Mill has established a written response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for: \nA?X    Providing proper first aid and medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances (The Rumford Mill has emergency responders and/or Medical staff on site at all times.)\nA?X    Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of response equipment\nA?X    Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment \nA?X    Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\nA?X    Training response teams (HAZMAT, Rescue, Fire Brigade, and Security)\nThe Rumford Mill maintains emergency response teams trained in emergency response procedures.  The emergency teams are a Pulp Mill HAZMAT Team and an Emergency Response Team (which includes HAZMAT, Confined Space Rescue, Fire Brigade, Security Team and a Medical Staff). All Rumford Mill employees are trained in evacuation procedures.  The Rumford Mill periodically conducts emergency response drills, including drills coordinated with the Rumford Fire Department and other emergency response agencies.\nThe Rumford Mill utilizes many tools to continually improve the safety and environmental programs at the mill, including: the Process Safety Management process, incident investigations, periodic audits and reviews, and employee participation in mill safety programs.\n"
