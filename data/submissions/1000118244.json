      "SummaryText": "Lemont Refinery Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery believes that Safety, Environmental\nStewardship, and being a good corporate neighbor are core business values.  To demonstrate these values substantial accident prevention resources have been invested into the refinery.  It is our policy to include accident prevention in every part of our business, design, operations, and maintenance systems.  However, if a release should occur, substantial resources (trained response personnel and equipment) will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammable products and flammable mixtures, including propane and butane.  In addition, the refinery uses Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) as a catalyst to produce consumer hydrocarbon products.  At Lemont refinery, we have identified eleven (11) RMP Covered process units.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery utilized EPA's RMP*Comp as the release modeling software to perform its offsite consequence analysis.  Each of these analyses is utilized to complete the OCA section of the RMP Submission.\n\nFor toxic modeling, the only toxic chemical above threshold quantity is HF. Worst case modeling used the greatest amount held in a single vessel released over a 10 minute period. Alternate release scenario modeling was done on a hose failure that occurs during the HF unloading process.  In the unlikely event of a release, water is the best medium to use to prevent airborne HF from affecting surrounding areas. Lemont Refinery has installed numerous mitigation systems to prevent effects of an HF release from occurring.  These include:\n\u0095\tRapid Acid De-Inventory System to qu"

This was done to verify that another vessel wouldn't potentially have a greater affect public receptors than the worst-case release scenario developed under requirements of the regulation. The flammable alternate release scenario, modeled a hole that develops in the feed line going into the Iso-Butane storage spheres.  This was chosen because of the area's proximity to the property line and the usefulness this scenario provides for emergency planning. The Lemont Refinery has installed LEL open path lasers to detect a release of iso-butane near the storage spheres and remote operated isolation valves to mitigate a potential release. \n\n5 - Year Accident History\n\nWhile minor releases of regulated chemicals have occurred in the last 5 years, there has not been any releases from RMP covered processes that met the criteria established in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Lemont Refinery has e"

These teams are responsible for understanding regulatory requirements, identifying gaps in the program, and developing and implementing plans to close gaps and enhance the programs. The accident prevention practices are summarized in the following paragraphs.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Refinery has a written plan to encourage employee participation in its prevention program.\nEmployees give input into the program in many different ways; some of these include: Process Hazard Analysis participation, Members of Incident Investigation Teams, Members of MOC hazard review and PSSR teams, review and use of Operating Procedures, development of Unit Specific Training, Safe Practice Standard Committee Membership, Safety Awareness Committee, etc. In addition to the written employee participation plan, employee involvement is also achieved with several hourly/salaried employee committees that are responsible for safety and health evaluations at the refinery.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe foundation for safe plant operations is the knowledge of how it is designed and how it should operate.  This knowledge must provide for identifying and understanding the hazards of the chemicals and processes of the plant.  It is required that this knowledge be documented. Process Safety Information comprises three categories:\n\u0095\tHazards of materials\n\u0095\tTechnical information\n\u0095\tEquipment design information\nThis information is made available to employees of the refinery and kept evergreen utilizing the facility Management of Change and Process Hazard Analysis process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis on each operation within the plant.

These procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures undergo a review and approval process before being made effective.  All effective operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary and certified as current and accurate on an annual basis.\n\nTraining\n\nOperators are trained in refinery and process overviews, refinery safe work practices, and specific procedures required to operate their process unit. After a new operator has been hired, they will undergo a 6 week course of refinery overviews, safe work practices, and process introduction. Once this is complete, a new hire will be released to their process unit to continue with on-the-job training as well as classroom and computer based training (CBT).

Contractor employers are required to ensure that the plant's safety rules are being followed.  Prior to contractors being brought onsite, the contract company is evaluated to assure they meet established safety requirements, have the required historical safety performance, and have employees who are qualified to perform work on the process units.  This evaluation is done utilizing a 3rd party network that provides contractor qualification grades based on refinery established criteria.  The refinery audits contractor work on a daily basis to ensure they are meeting the requirements.  A Contractor Safety Management Committee and Contractor Safety Association have been established to review safety issues and discuss performance at the Lemont Refinery.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Refinery performs a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for new facilities and/or modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This element of the program is closely tied to the Management of Change program and is an integral part of authorizing start up of physical changes.  An upgraded electronic MOC system has been implemented which includes mandatory PSSRs to be completed prior to authorization of change.  Lemont Refinery also requires that PSSRs are also done prior to start up after any major maintenance event.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Refinery maintains plant equipment in good operating condit"

In addition to repair, the refinery has a Preventive Maintenance schedule for tests and inspections of process equipment, conducts those tests and inspections, and repairs deficiencies that are found.  The Preventive Maintenance Program follows manufacturers' recommendations or recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nThe refinery Mechanical Integrity Program ensures that any new equipment meets design requirements and was installed properly before it is placed in service.  The refinery also ensures that spare parts and other maintenance materials are the correct ones for the job.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Refinery has safe work practices that govern many aspects of operations and maintenance of the facility. These practices are designed to ensure that all work in the refinery is completed safety. Examples include the refinery's general Safety Manual, Safe Work Permits, Hazardous Energy Control, Hot Work Procedure, Confined Space Entry, Fall Protection, Respiratory Protection, etc.  Employees are trained on these practices, and they are strictly enforced for any work in and around the refinery processes.  There is a joint salaried and hourly employee Safe Practice Standards committee that reviews, revises, and evaluates adherence to the refinery safe work practice standards. Any deviation from safety work practices must be reviewed and approved in accordance with refinery variance policy.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Refinery has written procedures for managing changes that occur in the processes.  The procedure requires a technical and safety review, making needed operating procedure changes, and a management authorization for the changes.  When changes are made, affected employees are to be trained in or informed of the change and equipment information and other process safety information is updated to document the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWhenever an incident or accident occurs that caused or might have resulted in a release of t"

The objective of the investigation is to determine the root cause(s) that lead to the incident and take appropriate action to prevent their reoccurrence.  All incidents and near misses are promptly reported and investigated by a field investigation team that collects evidence and related documentation to determine root causes and corrective actions. Incident that meets the requirements of RMP will have a higher-level team investigation using root cause analysis methodologies. The Refinery uses a team investigation approach that includes 2-6 people from many related disciplines who will review the details of the incident, identify root causes, and develop findings and recommendations for prevention of future incidents.  Electronic incident management systems are in place to assure that recommendations are reviewed by management and implemented in a timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Refinery performs an audit every three (3) years to ensure compliance with all elements of the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA Risk Management Program.  This audit is led by CITGO Corporate and performed by an outside entity (either personnel from other CITGO sites or 3rd Party Contractor). If non-compliance is discovered, then deficiencies are reviewed and corrected.\nIn addition to regulatory required audits, refinery management is constantly reviewing and evaluating PSM/RMP programs and Safety Practices to ensure that they are followed and in good standing. Key Performance Indicators are developed and assessed on a regular basis.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Refinery employs trained and certified Emergency Response and Medical Professionals that are at the facility 24 hours a day.  In addition, numerous shift operations personnel are trained to respond to and mitigate incidents.\n\nThe refinery maintains a Facility Response Plan that ensures that incidents are pr"

It details roles and responsibilities for emergency responders and incident management.  The plan includes procedures for notification of Local Responders, the Local Emergency Management Agency, as well as State and Federal Agencies as well as procedures for responding to fires and releases of toxic materials, incident assessment and mitigation, evacuation, hazardous material cleanup, and emergency medical information.\n\nThe Refinery maintains numerous pieces of emergency response equipment from fire trucks to hazardous material response vehicles and equipment.  It also maintains a fire water system that can supply ample fire water for fire and toxic vapor release mitigation, in addition to a separate water mitigation system that surrounds the main acid area of the Alkylation unit.   Since the last RMP update, the refinery has upgraded emergency response equipment including new rapid response trucks, upgraded firefighting foam, drone capabilities, hazmat trailer, and constructed a second fire station. \n\nThe Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the Will County Emergency Management Agency and the Will County LEPC.  The plan is also coordinated with the Lemont and Romeoville Fire Departments (local response organizations).  Response training and coordination is conducted to ensure the refinery response organization and local responders are familiar with each other's emergency response procedures and systems. Tabletop drills and field exercises are conducted periodically with participation from local, State, and Federal organizations. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt CITGO Lemont Refinery, we have a safety culture of continual improvement. One such improvement is evaluation of process units for implementation of additional Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) throughout the refinery"
