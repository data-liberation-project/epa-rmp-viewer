This includes classification, investigation and mitigation of risks and hazards identified by the investigation. The refinery employs an incident coordinator to oversee the incident management program and all incidents are reviewed by management. This includes reviewing incidents that may need to be investigated to comply with the requirements of PSM and RMP. This helps ensure that all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Investigations are conducted by a team of management, represented and contract employees (if a contractor was involved). The team produces a written report that includes finding, recommendations and learnings that are reviewed with management. Corrective actions are entered into the management system and tracked until completion. Investigation reports are available to all refinery employees.
