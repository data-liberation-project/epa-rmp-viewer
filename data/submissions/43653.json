              "Description": "VWR has compiled information that is necessary for safe handling and storage of regulate chemical products.  This information includes:\n\n?    Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each regulated chemical.  This information is available electronically or as hard copy.  The latest MSDS revision was May 2005;\n\n?    Maximum intended inventory of equipment in which regulated chemicals are stored.  (i.e., the maximum intended container size is 205 liters).\n\n?    Acceptable storage temperatures and conditions for flammable substances.  (Special conditions ? Ethyl Ether to be stored in the flammable storage room at ambient temperature.  Acids to be stored separately from ammonium hydroxide)\n\n?    Equipment use and maintenance specifications (use and maintenance specifications for forklifts, storage racks, and other equipment are maintained on file at the facility).  Appendix C of VWR?s IPRP displays the preventative maintenance procedures for equipment involved in the receipt, warehousing, transportation and storage of regulated chemicals;\n\n?    Codes and standards used to design and build the facility: NFPA 30 (Flammable and Combustible Liquids), NFPA 231 (Standard for General Storage), NFPA 231c (Standard for Rack Storage of Materials).  The Flammable Storage Room has been designed to the 1994 Uniform Fire Code.  Sprinkler and drain pipes have been installed with earthquake shock absorbers and buffers between the pipes and building wall connections according to local fire codes.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW\n\nThe hazard associated with the regulated chemical are:\n\n?    Corrosivity\n?    Flammability\n?    Toxicity\n\nVWR periodically reviews and audits its operations to identify and control potential hazards.  The most recent review was completed on June 3, 2002.  The review was conducted using, as a guide, Guidance for Auditing Risk Management Plans/Programs under the Clean Air Act 112(r).  This document cited in EPA?s guidance document Risk Management Program for Warehouses (40 CFR 68), as providing a suitable framework for conducting a hazard review.  Additionally, facility personnel and other persons familiar with warehouse operations provided input to the hazard review process.\n\nThe major hazards identified during this review were:\n?    Toxic Release\n?    Fire or explosion\n?    Earthquake\n?    Equipment Failure\n\nThe possible effects of external events such as earthquake, tornado and flooding were considered.  Existing emergency shut down procedures were deemed adequate for handling most external events.  However, VWR intends to conduct further investigation to determine whether current earthquake protections are in conformance with accepte guidelines in California.\n\nCurrent facility management practices were deemed appropriate to prevent a fire and explosion hazards during normal facility operation and foreseeable emergencies.  For example, the existence of standard operating procedures and training programs help minimize the risk of human error associated with normal facility operations.  Similarly, daily inspection of forklifts and the use of standard checklists, help ensure that forklifts do not fail while in use for materials handling.\n\nIf a chemical release were to occur, it would be first detected by an operator, either visually or by odor.  Once detected, the facility has direct-reading colorimetric detection equipment that can determine the concentration of the chemical in air (measured in parts per million or percent).\n\nMitigation systems and equipment are available for use by trained VWR emergency response personnel in the event of a release.  A corrosives spill can be controlled through a special neutralizing and absorbing material, which is applied to the spill.  Similarly, toxic substances can be absorbed and containerized for later disposal.  Mitigation systems for fire and explosion include a system of sprinklers, dikes, firewalls and blast panels.\n\nAlthough findings from the audit were favorable, several action items were identified as follows:\n\n?    Worst case flammable scenario for ethyl ether needs to include the larger drum size using 313 lbs. in the simulation.\n?    Updates to minor items and in SOPs, safety inspections, emergency response plans and the RMP need to be included.\n?    Newer maps of the facility and the area are available and should be included in the emergency response plan.\n\nThese items were completed.  The new Worst Case Flammables scenario did not alter the overall endpoint or effected population.  It was deemed unnecessary to resubmit the RMP to EPA.\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nVWR maintains written procedures for most operations.  Appendix C of VWR?s Risk Management Plan identifies procedures relating to normal start-up and routine operations; Section 2 for procedures relating to emergency shutdown. Section 2 includes procedures for temporary operations during an emergency.  The issuance or revision date is shown on procedures to indicate the date of last revision.\n\nTRAINING\n\nVWR provides employee training for routine operations and emergency situations.  The training process can include one or more instructional formats, such as lecture, videotape, interactive computer-based training, hands-on exercises, demonstrations and on the job training.  Training is conducted by a qualified instructor or other competent person.  Employee proficiency may be evaluated using one or more techniques, including actual demonstration, classroom test or verbal assessment.\n\nVWR has reviewed the capabilities of existing employees and determined that the employees possess the knowledge, skill and ability to perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.  A written certification to this effect has been prepared and is on file at VWR acknowledging the training and competency of all individuals named in the risk management plan.\n\nNew employees and employees who are transferred to new responsibilities receive training prior to starting the job.  This ensures that all employees understand and can perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.\n\nEmployees will be retrained whenever operating procedures are significantly revised, and at least once every three years, even if procedures have not been changed.  Specific OSHA, DOT and EPA training requirements may also dictate more frequent training.\n\nFor administrative efficiency, training under this section may be combined with any other employee training provided by VWR.\n\nVWR has formally asked each of its on-site contractors to certify in writing that their people working on-site have been trained in accordance with the proper safety and environmental health standards, and they currently adhere to all applicable regulations for the same.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nVWR maintains a list of process equipment that requires routine inspection and maintenance.  There are written procedures relating to inspection and maintenance requirements.  Personnel responsible for inspection and maintenance are trained on these procedures.  These procedures are typically developed by VWR or are obtained from equipment manufacturers.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nVWR will conduct an audit at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance with Prevention Program requirements.  The next audit will be completed no later than June 3, 2005.  Findings and recommended corrective actions will be put in writing, and corrective actions will be implemented in a timely manner.  Upon completion of corrective actions VWR will provide a written certification that the compliance evaluations have been completed.  All written records relating to compliance audits will be retained for at least five (5) years.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nVWR?s emergency procedures include provision for conducting an investigation and analysis of each incident in which the emergency plan is activated.  Because VWR investigates all incidents, this procedure satisfies the requirement that VWR investigate each incident that ?resulted in, or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.?\n\nEach incident report and corrective actions will be put in writing.  Corrective actions will be implemented promptly.  The results of the investigation will be reviewed with affected workers (VWR and vendors) whose job tasks are relevant to the incident.  The incident report will be retained for a minimum of five (5) years.   At a minimum, a summary shall be prepared including the following elements:\n?    A description of the incident;\n?    Date of the accident or potential accident;\n?    Date the investigation was begun;\n?    Factors contributing to the accident or event;\n?    Any recommendations resulting from the investigation.\n\nCorrective actions will be promptly implemented.  The results of the investigation will be reviewed with affected workers (VWR and vendors) whose job tasks are relevant to the incident.  The incident investigation report and all supporting documentation will be retained for a minimum of five (5)years.",

      "SummaryText": "VWR International (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The regulated chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single ?covered process? for regulatory purposes.  The following regulated chemicals were identified to exceed the threshold quantity (TQ) for regulation under the federal Clean Air Act Accident Release Prevention rule (CAA ARP) or the associated California Regulation (Cal ARP)\n\nFederal:\nChloroform        20,000 lbs\n\n\nCalARP\nChloroform        20,000 lbs\nEthyl Ether        5,000  lbs\nHydrochloric acid    10,000 lbs\nHydrofluoric acid    650 lbs\nNitric acid        4300 lbs\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 205 liter metal drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  RMP Comp version 1.7, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility that toxic effects may be anticipated, "

However, both release scenarios considered indoor releases contained by dikes or berms in the flammable storage room.\n\nVWR?s prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n?    Safety Information ? includes detailed information about the hazards of the regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n?    Hazard Review ? a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures ? written SOP?s to guide employees in safety conducting normal, temporary and non-routine/emergency operations.\n\n?    Training ? includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expected to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n?    Maintenance ? required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified workers.\n\n?    Compliance Audits ? conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n?    Incident Investigation ? conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.  Flammable chemicals are stored and handled in specially designed rooms with electrical fixtures and equipment that "

In the event a container is damaged, there is special low-level ventilation to capture flammable vapors before an explosive concentration can accumulate.  Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.  \n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering from regulated substances or otherwise.  However, VWR has developed a comprehensive emergency response program that addresses small and large-scale incidents, including coordination with outside agencies and responders."
