Natrosol \u00ae  is used  as a thickener in latex paint and personal care products. The primary ingredients in Natrosol \u00ae are cellulose (wood or cotton linter fiber) and ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is received in 25,000-gallon railroad tank cars and stored in two tanks, each limited to 27,000 gallons by administrative controls. The ethylene oxide unloading and storage area is provided with containment dikes and pits in which a spill can be diluted with water. This facility is also equipped with leak detectors and fixed water spray nozzles to minimize any adverse impacts if there were a spill.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nNo longer required.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario: \nNo longer required.\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe use of ethylene oxide at Parlin has been subject to the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) regulations since their adoption in 1988, as well as the subsequently adopted OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119).  The plant has an established risk management system in place to meet these requirements and to minimize the potential for accidental release of these substances. Our management system includes:\n1. Process hazard analysis to identify and address potential hazards.\n2. Management of change procedures to assure that standards are maintained and potential new hazards assessed. \n3. Mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, Detailed operating procedures for process control \n4. Training for the personnel involved in operating and maintaining the processes.\n5. Facility design incorporates multiple layers of incident prevention.\n\nFive"
