The facility consists of seven 30,000 gallon tanks and is serviced by 30,000 gallon railroad cars, staged on railroad property, awaiting offload.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pullaway leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\nWe have never had an accident at this location involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Hermon, ME Fire Department and request that t"
