      "SummaryText": "The City of Belmont and the Belmont Water Pollution Control Facility personnel are committed to the safe operation of the wastewater treatment plant.  The plant uses chlorine as to disinfect wastewater to maintain public health and receiving stream water quality.\r\n \r\nThe waste water is biologically treated then disinfected via chlorination.  In the disinfection process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated wastewater is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in a contact chamber, killing pathogens that are dangerous to humans, animals and aquatic life that remain after biological treatment. After chlorination, the wastewater is further treated with sulfur dioxide to dechlorinate the water to within regulatory guidelines for water discharged directly to the river (now set at 27 ppb or less)\r\n\r\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Belmont Water Pollution Control Facility stores a maximum of six one-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 12,000 pounds of chlorine) and is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of chlorine also makes the facility subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119)requirements. Sulfur dioxide is also stored at the facility; but, in quantities less than the 2,500 pound threshold for RMP considerations. \r\n\r\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The alternative toxic release scenario is a slower release approximated as a leak evacuating a cylinder in a total of 100 minutes.  Again, this would involve a release of 2,000 pounds, over longer period of time.  These releases could affect local populations.\r\n\r\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  All tenets of the Process Safety Management Program are incl"

As a testament to these programs, the Belmont Water Pollution Control Facility has not had a chlorine release in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency response to accidents and releases is coordinated with the Gaston County LEPC.  In the event of a chlorine accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify the LEPC and evacuate the facility.  Trained LEPC staff will evaluate the situation and make further decisions."
