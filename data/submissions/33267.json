There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five year period.\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n? Written site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n?  Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n? Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\n? Chlorine system maintenance procedures\n\n? Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation\n\n? Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\n? Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan\n\n? Training in support of the certification of operators\n          \nThe plant superintendent and the operators annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. Recent activities include a Process Hazard Analysis, a RMP Self-Audit and RMP training in June 2004. \n          \nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals.\n? In 1996, a full vacuum chlorine delivery system was installed. The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine. \n? Plant inventories have been reduced from five (5) full cylinders to three (3) full cylinders of chlorine at the site.\n? A plant expansion is underway which is scheduled to replace chlorine with an UV (ultraviolet light) disinf"

      "SummaryText": "ectant process by the end of 2007. \n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 1999, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County EMS and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a Regional HAZMAT Team to provide hazardous materials response have been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are being planned.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City  of Oxford has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets quarterly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n            - Hazard Communications\n\n            - Personal Protective Equipment\n \n           - Lockout/Tagged\n\n           - Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have been no reportable chlorine releases from the plant.  The plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.\n\nReport by:\n\nDennis Wilson\nWWTP Superintendent \nCity of Oxford"
