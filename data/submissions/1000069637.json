Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the Kraft Heinz design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Kraft Heinz has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n\n\n1.1.    Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.    It is the policy of Kraft Heinz to:\n\n\n\n1.1.1.1    Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.2    Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.3    Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.4    Ensure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work i"

Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n\n\n1.1.3.    This facilities aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials whereever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n\n\n1.1.4.    Kraft Heinz has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process.  It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n\n\n1.1.5.    The first duty of Kraft Heinz employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n\n\n1.2.    Facility Description\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz is a food processing facility where food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, assembled, frozen and packaged for shipment to end users. A total of 355 employees work at the facility in a three shift schedule.  There is a minimum of two operators on duty/on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n\n\n1.2.1.

Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System\". Over the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the Process System.  The engine room, which houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery and motor control center, is located on the northeast quadrant of the facility.\n\n\n\n1.3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n1.3.1.    As required by EPA guidelines, the worst-case release scenario involves a failure within the process system.  The worst-case release scenario was calculated and the results are on file at the Massillon facility.  \n\n1.3.2.    The alternative release scenario involves the loss of anhydrous ammonia through a safety relief valve that is installed on one of the process system's vessels containing liquid ammonia. This scenario was also calculated and is held on filed at the facility. \n\n\n\n1.4.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\n1.4.1.    Kraft Heinz is equipped with an emergency warning system.  Alarms are placed in the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Kraft Heinz Emergency Response Manual. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.    Plant personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and other various rules and regulations. \n\n\n\n1.4.3.    The Massillon Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discuss emerge"
