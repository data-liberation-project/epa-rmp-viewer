      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\n\r\nThe Geismar, Louisiana facility operates steam-methane reformer (SMR) units, each of which produces a flammable gas mixture called synthesis gas (syngas) . This syngas contains primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and small amounts of other flammable and inert gases. The syngas from the  units is further refined on-site into final products of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide. Some of the syngas produced by the reformer units is also used indirectly as a raw material in a formaldehyde production process. Anhydrous ammonia is used to control the air emissions from one of the reformer units.  The ammonia is injected into the flue gas and passed over a catalyst to reduce potential air pollutants into harmless substances such as nitrogen and water vapor.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \r\n\r\n1. Methane:  Supplied by a local natural gas utility, is reacted in steam-methane reformer units to produce syngas, which is a flammable gas mixture containing hydrogen, methane and other non-regulated substances. \r\n\r\n2. Hydrogen:  Produced on site and supplied to local customer via pipeline.\r\n\r\n3. Formaldehyde:  Stored in our tank farm, and distributed to a nearby customer via  pipeline.  \r\n\r\n4. Anhydrous ammonia:  Used to control the air emissions from one of the reformer units.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\n\r\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possi"
