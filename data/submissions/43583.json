If this is not possible water should be applied to the leak in the form of a mist to dilute the fumes or the tank should be cooled with water if the pop off valve releases.  The fire department should be called to help if adequate water cannot be supplied with our equipment in place.  Wind direction should be noted to see if evacuation is necessary down wind.  If the leak is very serious proper authorities with self contained oxygen units can be contacted to shut the leak off.  Anhydrous handlers will wear gloves, goggles and long sleeve shirts.  Transfer hoses that go to nurse tanks are to be bled off and locked up every evening.  The large storage tank is to be locked up every evening.  The valves and hoses are to be checked periodically.  This plan is a working document to prepare all employees for immediate informed response to emergency situations.  Proper response to an emergency is designed to protect public health, property and the enviroment as well as our most valuable asset, our employees."
