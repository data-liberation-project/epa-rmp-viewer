Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  \n\nThe most recent PSM compliance audit was completed in August 22, 2022.  PSM compliance audits are conducted every 3 years.\n\nA brief summary of key aspects of the prevention program is provided below:\n\n\u00bf\tThe facility employs a dedicated and full-time PSM coordinator to ensure the facility's program elements are in compliance and procedures are being followed.\n\u00bf\tUtility/maintenance personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, at all times with production; on days the factory is not operational, Utility/Maintenance personnel are to perform daily checks on the ammonia system, and are available on-call 24/7.  The ammonia alarm panels are also monitored 24/7, 365.\n\u00bf\tEmployees are included in the development of the PSM program.\n\u00bf\tMost of the ammonia pipework is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of ammonia release.\n\u00bf\tThe plant provides routine on-the-job training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates:  August 2019-June 2024.  The rule requires that the 5-year accident history include all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  To date, there have been no accidental spills or releases of ammonia at this facility for the past 5 years meeting those conditions.  This 5-year history does not include any nuisance odor reports (i.e., packing leaks that were reported by employees"

This facility has implemented the use of an electronic preventive maintenance system, which manages preventative maintenance, inspection, and training aspects of release prevention.  The ammonia compressor safety cutouts are inspected semiannually and maintenance procedures were reviewed in March 28, 2024.\nNestle has developed and implemented emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage to the ammonia system at all times with production; on days the factory is not operational, Utility/Maintenance personnel are to perform daily checks on the ammonia system, and are available on-call 24/7.  The ammonia alarm panels are also monitored 24/7, 365.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Medford Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission (Taylor County Emergency Management Director), in the event of an emergency.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nNestle manufactures frozen pizza products at the Medford plant.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes for the primary process at this facility are 311412 and 3114121.  Nestle has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Medford plant - ammonia.  The ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on site is approximately 48,223 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT"
