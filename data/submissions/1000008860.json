Only the chlorine supplier will install or remove chlorine cylinders at the facility.  Plant personnel have been trained in procedures regarding the use of chlorine.  The chlorine system operates under a vacuum to minimize the potential for release.\n\nEmergency response policies are discussed below under the section entitled Emergency Response Plan.\n\nFacility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Katy Wastewater Treatment Plant is currently a 3.07 MGD plant. This facility is committed to accident prevention and protection of employees and the public.  \n\nThe plant utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  Chlorine is maintained at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present on-site and any one time is 4,000 pounds which is in excess of the Risk Management Planning threshold of 1,500 pounds.  Sulfur dioxide is also maintained at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide present at any one time is 4,000 pounds, which is below the Risk Management Planning threshold of 5,000 pounds.  \n\nThe City of Katy Plant was constructed in 1979, expanded in 2004, and has never had an accidental release of a toxic chemical.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Safety Hazard Analysis was conducted in May 2009 using the what-if and checklist methodologies.  The Plant chlorine system utilizes numerous engineering and administrative safeguards including vacuum design to minimize release potential, use of continuous gas detectors to provide early warning of a release, operating procedures for the system, preventative maintenance procedures, personnel training and use of personal protective equipment.  \n\nTo maintain compli"

      "SummaryText": "ance with the Process Safety Management Standard, the plant operator will certify that training has been provided to personnel operating the chlorine system and the sulfur dioxide system.  Also, refresher training will be conducted at a minimum of yearly.  That training will cover the areas of process safety information, operating procedures and emergency procedures.  Training records will be maintained. \n\nThe City will verify outside contractors training before starting work.  The contractor will be informed of the toxic compounds on site, and the potential for hazardous release.  The City will also inform the contractors of their responsibility while on site.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant has had no accidental releases of either chlorine of sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe City has developed an Emergency Action Plan in lieu of Emergency Response Plan.  It addresses the requirements of 40 CFR 68 pertaining to notification, medical treatment, response procedures, planning, use and maintenance of emergency equipment, employee safety training and emergency response evaluation dealing with chlorine gas.   After discovery of a leak, the Operator and one other person will make an assessment of the situation.   If the assessment indicates that repair by Plant personnel is possible, the Plant personnel will perform the needed repairs.  If the assessment indicates that a major leak has occurred, the Plant's Emergency Action Plan will be implemented and the City of Katy Police Department will be notified.  All communication with other response agencies and any notification to the public will be coordinated through the City of Katy Police Department.  Plant personnel are trained in the Emergency Action Plan at least annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll employee's involved in process will receive training on improved procedures and RMP elements for the year 2009.\n\n"
