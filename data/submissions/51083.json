      "SummaryText": "A. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Campbell Soup Supply Company that the receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine at its facility in Sacramento, CA be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Campbell Soup Supply Company has gathered safety information on chlorine, performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events that might affect the process, performed an offsite consequence analysis of defined release scenarios, established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases, and established a written emergency action plan coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nThe Environmental Project Engineer is responsible for the management of the chlorine safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCampbell Soup operates a food processing plant located at 6200 Franklin Blvd., Sacramento in Sacramento County.  The facility prepares food ingredients, blends food ingredients, and fills food products into containers for sale throughout the Western United States.  The regulated substance used at Campbell Soup?s facility and considered in this RMP is chlorine.  Chlorine gas is used to disinfect well water for process uses.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Sta"

      "SummaryText": "rtup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\nD.   Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any chlorine-related incidents at the Sacramento Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe emergency response plan for this facility consists of notifying emergency responders and evacuating personnel to designated assembly areas upwind of the release location.   Once the affected areas have been isolated, trained facility personnel will respond to chlorine releases up to an Operations level per HAZWOPER regulations.  Their role is to contain a release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and prevent possible exposures.  If the release is beyond the capabilities of facility personnel, representatives from the Sacramento County HAZMAT Division would be called to respond to the incident.\n\nThe emergency response program has been coordinated with the Fire Department and with the Sacramento County HAZMAT Division.\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral modifications have been made to the chlorine system over the past five years to improve safety.  Since all measures identified have already been implemented to date there are no current planned changes to further improve safety at the facility."
