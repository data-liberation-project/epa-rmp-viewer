      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of The McGregor Company (TMC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to the operations at the TMC Boettcher Landing Facility located at Central Ferry in Pomeroy, WA.  At this Facility, TMC engages in the distribution and sale of chemicals to customers, most of who use TMC's products to support agricultural operations.  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia from the Boettcher Landing Facility located approximately 24 miles north-northwest of Pomeroy, WA at 601 Central Ferry Road, Pomeroy, WA 99347.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Boettcher Landing Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Boettcher Landing Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nTMC is submitting this plan as a \"Resubmission\" of all applicable sections of the RMP.  Based on its analysis, TMC has revised this RMP to reflect 2 covered processes and has changed the RMP Program Level from 2 to 3.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at the Boettcher Landing Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Boettcher Landing Facility stores and"

A total of nine (9) 34,000-gallon insulated railcars can be staged on the North and South Rail Spurs combined.  Trained Facility Process Operators transfer the anhydrous ammonia from the railcars to all three (3) storage stationary tanks for storage.  Two of the stationary storage tanks are 30,000 gallons and one is 25,949 gallons.  From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia may be transferred to NH3 Semi Truck(s) for transportation to the client location.  TMC trains all of its Process Operators and Maintenance Personnel in the relevant operating and maintenance procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the two covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1), and (2) the failure of making a sealed connection of the loading arm to the NH3 Semi Truck.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices and emergency shutoff valves) and operating procedures that TMC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Boettcher La"

      "SummaryText": "nding Facility Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Boettcher Landing Facility Manager is assisted by other trained TMC staff, as directed.  The Boettcher Landing Facility Manager is responsible for ensuring that TMC Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nTMC's Boettcher Landing Facility is a non-responding facility. TMC has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Boettcher Landing Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by The McGregor Company at the Boettcher Landing Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Boettcher Landing Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Whitman County LEPC and Pomeroy Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Boettcher Landing Facility.\n\n"
