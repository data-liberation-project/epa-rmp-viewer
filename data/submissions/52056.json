As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, CIE completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCentral Indiana Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of Central Indiana Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, it is the policy of Central Indiana Ethanol to notify the Marion City Fire Department and Grant County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 115,800 pounds.  Central Indiana Ethanol has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios related to anhydrous ammonia.  An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Central Indiana Ethanol has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.   \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP revision, Central Indiana Ethanol has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.

      "SummaryText": "fety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation will be conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.  A  PHA for the ethanol process was conducted prior to start up and no significant modiifcations to the process was required as a result. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nCentral Indiana Ethanol does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
