Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nSmith Frozen Foods, INC (SFFI) has implemented a risk management plan. We prevent accidents by designing for safety, taking care of our equipment, operating safely, and auditing our operations. SFFI has an active Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which is audited every three years.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nSFFI is a year-round facility processing frozen vegetables. SFFI also freezes vegetables.  The facility operates a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for product freezing and storage.  At this facility there are 4 freeze tunnels and two large cold storage facilities.  The total ammonia inventory exceeds the threshold quantity for accidental release prevention. \n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program below. The facility has committed to completing audits and inspections as well as holding employee meetings to establish current procedures.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nOperating Procedures \n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nHot Work Permit \n\nManagement of Change \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nCompliance Safety Audits\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damag"

Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the case of an accidental release all nonessential personnel are to leave the area of the possible release. Various emergency controls are activated; exhaust fans may be used to expel ammonia from the facility or doors may be closed if it is determined that the release should be contained.  Local emergency officials are immediately notified and requested to assist by dialing 911. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Improvements\n\nAny areas of improvement that can be identified in audits, hazard analyses and inspections are identified, and corrective actions are taken in the event a recommendation is made.\n\n"
