      "SummaryText": "Hygiene offices perform routine inspections and identified problem areas are cited for immediate correction. \r\n\r\nABATEMENT: In an emergency situation the Fire Division is immediately notified either by telephone or the alarm system. The incident is then assessed for hazardous consequences. Either the spill cleanup crew or the Emergency Response Team is notified and the proper regulatory agencies are contacted. The incident is then remediated in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nTRAINING: NAWS China Lake training is provided by various organizational elements. The OSH office provides Hazard Communication training including specific hazard training via the Chief of Navy Installations web site. The Environmental Planning and Management Department provides initial HAZWOPER and annual refresher training. The Fire Division provides training on Disaster Preparedness as well as the proper use of fire extinguishers. Additionally, each organizational element provides Safety training on topics specific to their operations. Training records are maintained for three (3) years at the OSH office.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES/PROCESSES: NAWS China Lake performed a feasibility study on changing from chlorine gas for its wastewater treatment to a concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite. The study determined that the change of process chemistry involved much more than a simple \"drop-in\" replacement. Aside from the Hypochlorite solution, other supporting chemicals had to be used. The change would have additionally required major construction to our facility and the procurement and installation of additional reaction vessels. This would have necessitated the initiation of a Military Construction (MILCON) request. If granted the MILCON would, in and of itself, have been cost prohibitive without factoring in the additional cost of the reaction vessels, addition chemicals, and increased manpower to operate the new process. For these reasons the change was d"
