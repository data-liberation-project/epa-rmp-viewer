It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Inland South and the Visalia Fire Department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of foam products that are used as packaging material. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.19.
