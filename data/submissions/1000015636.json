              "Description": "To meet the requirements of Process Safety Management (PSM), Springdale Ice Cream and Beverage uses a comprehensive maintenance and Menchanical Integrity program for all critical process equipment. This program is in place to verify that all ammonia refrigeration equipment is designed and installed correctly, and operated safely and properly.  The program also establishes a formal procedure for training system operators to perform tasks associated with the ammonia system. A sound preventive maintenance program is vital tothe continued safe and efficient operation of the system. Therefore, we have established an ongoing, documented inspection and testing program. We conduct daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections of all critical process equipment. \n\nFor safety and security purposes we have installed a video survellance camera outside the plant near the ammonia receiver.  A fence has been installed around the ammonia receiver and is locked to prevent unauthorized entry.  The perimeter of the property is also fenced.  \n\nTwenty-seven (27) Ammonia Sensors are located inside and outside the plant. All of the ammonia sensors are wired to a central alarm panel in the Engine Room. There are two (2) inside sensors with associated manual activation switches, that when activated, they turn on the emergency ventilation fans. There is also one (1) sensor and associated manual activation switch, that when activated, shuts down all ammonia compressors and closes the \"king\" valve.",

An Ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7) Refrigeration system is used at the facility to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The ammonia refrigeration system is regulated under OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and is subjected to Program 3 requirements of the EPAA?s Risk Management Program.  SICB is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers the following areas:\n\n-Employee Participation\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n-Operating Procedures\n-Non-Routine Work Practices\n-Contractor Requirements\n-Process Safety Review\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Training Requirements\n-Management of Change\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n-Incident Investigation\n-Emergency Planning and Response\n-Compliance Audits\n-Security Against Theft\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Springdale Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nPlant employees are kept informed of the PSM program by initial training upon hire and periodic refresher training in safety meetings and plant wide events.  The facilityA?s Refrigeration technicians are in charge of the administration and actual operation of the ammonia system.  All records of the PSM system are maintained in the PSM office located in the Engine Room of the facility, where they are open to examination at any time by concerned employees or management.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nWritten information is available to the employees"

The written information includes the MSDS for ammonia and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.  An Emergency Response Summary book has been prepared and distributed to the Springdale Fire Department to help them to be prepared for an emergency response.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies so that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist Technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are reevaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, SICB maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining:\nA program has been developed for training employees in all aspects of the refrigeration system.  Training for the refrigeration technicians includes a review of all duties they must perform on the ammonia refrigeration system.  The technician training program includes formal classroom training, on-the-job training, and performance demonstrations.\n\nContractors:\nAll contractors working on the system are screened and evaluated by the technicians in charge of the PSM program before being allowed to work on the ammonia refrigeration system.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nSICB carries out well documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to provide proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nHot Work Permit:\nThis element of the system requires that a signed permit is obtained before any cutting, welding, or open flame is used at the facility.\n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at SICB to manage changes in ammonia systems technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nSICB promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an unintentional release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring.

This event occurred on June 14, 2010.  A total of 394 pounds of ammonia was released, causing evacuation of the facility.  This release occurred when a product mix tank air vent line was mistakenly capped after the tank was cleaned.  As a result, when the tank was filled with ice cream mix, the tank over pressurized and swelled.  This swelling caused the vessel to distort and split the outer metal shell.  The shell dropped on to the ammonia oil drain valve and piping located below the tank, causing the ammonia release.  The tank was removed from service and piping modifications have been installed that will prevent the vent line from being mistakenly capped in the future.  Four employees were treated and released at area hospitals.  No one off site was injured.  No off site evacuations were necessary.\n"
