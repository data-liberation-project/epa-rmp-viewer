      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nIdeal Chemical and Supply Company, Inc.,  is a distributor of industrial and commercial chemicals.  Ideal also repackages, blends and formulates a variety of powdered and liquid chemical products.\n\nThe Memphis facility is constructed on four acres of land located at 4025 Air Park Street in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee.  The building faces to the east with production and product storage to the south, and west.  Most of the drainage from the site goes to storm drains located in the lower truck lot and railroad tracks and drains west to Getwell Road.\n\nIdeal Chemical & Supply Co. is committed to The Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  This process recognizes the need for industry to meet or exceed legal requirements for the responsible management of chemicals and chemical industry practices in achieving the collective objectives of improved health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nThe following describes just a few of the programs that have been implemented at Ideal to improve operations and reduce risks:\n\n1.  Risk Management:  Chemical safety management affects both employees and customers.  Through        evaluation and planning Ideal strives to reduce the risks associated with handling chemicals throughout their lifecycle.\n\n2.  Compliance Review and Training:  Regulations are constantly changing, and staying current is the first step of the challenge.  Ideal makes the difference by implementing programs for compliance and sharing information upon request.\n\n3.  Carrier Selection:  Safe transportation of chemicals is essential in responsible distribution.  Our drivers are fully trained, our trucks properly maintained, and our products contained and secured.  We routinely audit our outside carriers to verify that they also meet the same safety requirements.\n\n4.  Handling and Storage:  Proper handling and stroage includes facility design, loading and unloading, maintenance and cleaning.  Unders"

      "SummaryText": "tanding the latest information on chemical hazards safeguards against exposures, prevents accidents and reduces emissions.\n\n5.  Job Procedures and Training:  Written operating procedures, along with job descriptions that include minimum skill requirements, standardize our operation.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan:  Systematic emergency response requires consistent planning, both internally and in cooperation with outside agencies.  Installation of containment systems, emergency drills, communication and facility tours are a few of the steps Ideal has taken.\n\n7.  Community Outreach:  Ideal is dedicated to interacting with the community on issures related to responsible chemical distribution.  We work with government agencies to support public policies and regulations that address community concerns.\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nChemicals handled by Ideal that are subject to the Risk Managment Program include chlorine, and oleum (sulfuric acid).  Chlorine is handled in 150 lb. and 2000 lb. cylinders,and sulfuric acid  in an aboveground storage tank. \n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, Ideal has investigated possible accident scenarios using the U.S. EPA approved RMP*Comp model to evaluate potential offsite impacts.  Ideal believes that the most resonable accident scenario involving chlorine could impact an area with a radius of O.1 mile from the facility.  This scenario involves the leaking of chlorine from a cylinder.  Likewise, the most probable releases of sulfuric acid have the potential to impact an area of similar size.\n\nIdeal has not had an accident or release involving the above chemicals during the last five years.\n\nIdeal is subject to the Process Safety Management rules of OSHA.  Ideal is constantly evaluating its safety programs for improvement."
