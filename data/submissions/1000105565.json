      "SummaryText": "The Restaurant Depot Distribution Center\n10700 Telge Rd, Houston, Texas\nThe Intent of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of Anhydrous ammonia, and mitigate the \nseverity of a potential release that may occur.\nThe Restaurant Depot Is a distribution facility that provides dry and perishable goods to our stores across Texas. Goods are brought in and stored and shipped out on a daily basis. Restaurant Depot is a refrigerated warehouse that handles an average of 25-35 trucks a day inbound and 15-18 outbound. To refrigerate the warehouse, we have an ammonia refrigeration system that requires about 14000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This is a closed loop system with all ammonia vessels being located in the warehouse building. Ammonia is considered a low-pressure refrigerant that we operate from 0 to 180 PSI. The system is maintained by experienced personnel employed by the Restaurant Depot, and qualified contractors who assist in keeping the system up to date and in peak operating order. Throughout the history of this facility there has never been a major release of ammonia. We adhere to strict preventive maintenance program to ensure safe operation.\nThe system is also equipped with an automated control system, that monitors the operations 24 hours a day 365 a year. It is set up to shut down operation of system should something get out of set parameters. Ammonia sensors are located throughout the DC, that will warn of any release to help with the safety of or staff and community.\nIf leaks do happen most are small enough to stay within the confines of the building and handled by trained personnel. \nIf we were to have a large release the Harris County Hazmat Response Team, the Fire Department and Police will be notified to make sure all safety concerns are covered. if there was to be a large release the community would be notified by the response teams mentioned above.\nThis facility follows OSHA PSM guidelines.\nRestaurant Depot has a contingency program setup for repo"
