Our goals include employee safety and prevention of all hazardous material releases to the environment.  We will maintain a safety and environmental program, which embodies the proper attitudes toward safety and environmental protection on the part of everyone.  This program requires the total cooperation on the part of every employee in all safety, health and environmental matters.\n\nBHS ACQUISITION has specifically authorized designated facility emergency coordinators to commit any resources necessary to control an incident.  This includes mobilization of other emergency response organizations as well as the purchase of necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nII.\tGeneral Facility Description\n\nBHS ACQUISITION - Nampa, Idaho is located in an industrial area along Interstate-I84, inside the Nampa, ID. city limits.  The site is split into two separate properties"

The property that provides storage for the RMP chemicals is bounded on three sides by other businesses and factories, and to the east by a large field.  Surrounding uses are industrial.  The closest residence is 0.3 miles away.  There are no at-risk populations (e.g., schools, nursing homes, day-care centers, hospitals, prisons, etc.) located within 0.5 mile of the facility.  The closes environmentally sensitive area is the Deer Flat National Wildlife Refuge, approximately 5.0 miles away.\n\nA.  Description of Primary Activities at Facility\n\n BHS - Nampa is a warehousing, distribution, packaging and blending facility only.  No manufacturing of chemical products occurs at this facility.  All RMP regulated chemical products are received, stored and delivered to customers in the original closed containers.\n\nB.  Description of Facility Processes\n\nBHS - Nampa engages in the following activities:\n--Delivery by truck of chemical products in bulk and non-bulk UN-approved containers,\n--Internal movement of chemical products from the receiving area by forklift (or pallet jack( to and from the designated storage area),\n--Delivery of chemical products to customers,\n--Packaging from large containers into small containers (no RMP chemicals),\n--Blending of two or more chemicals into a third chemical.\n\nC.  Description of Products/Quantities Handled at Facility\n\nBHS Nampa from time to time may store two CAA \u00a7112 RMP program chemicals in amounts that exceed threshold planning quantities:  Chlorine gas and Sulfur Dioxide Gas.  The largest container of chlorine gas that might be stored at the facility is a one-ton cylinder.  The largest container of sulfur dioxide gas that might be stored at the facility is a one-ton cylinder.\n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention Planning at the Facility\n\nA.

      "SummaryText": "summary.  The primary legislation affecting chlorine is OSHA's Process Safety Management(PSM) rule.  A chlorine PSM program has been implemented at the facility.  The uniform fire and building codes also apply to this facility and are enforced by the Nampa City Fire Department.  The fire department performs periodic safety inspections of the facility.\n\nThe Company has a formal safety-training program designed to meet training requirements promulgated by OSHA, DOT and EPA.  Hazard communication training (OSHA) is the primary method the Company uses to educate employees on the risks associated with these two chemicals.  Emergency response training is performed in accordance with OSHA's HazComm/Hazwoper regulations (29CFR Part1910.120 and 29CFR Part1910.1200).\n\nB.  Internal (Company) Release Prevention Program Requirements\n\nBHS is a member of and has an employee on the Board of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD), It is certified under the NACD's Product Stewardship / Responsible Distribution Program.  This program requires member companies to prepare policies and procedures that promote the safe use and handling of chemical products by member companies and also by customers who purchase the chemical products.  BHS has more than 100 policies/procedures that address topics including the storage, handling, and transportation of compressed gases and incident planning for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide gas (among other BHS - designated chemicals of concern).\n\nBHS facilities are audited regularly for compliance with all internal and external requirements by BHS environmental staff as well as independent auditors.\n\nIV.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents or accidental releases involving either of these chemicals have occurred at BHS Nampa facility. \n\nV.  Emergency Response Program\n\nBHS - Nampa has an emergency response plan that is exercised annually.  The plan is reviewed and updated as often as necessary (e.g., to reflect changes in personnel,"

The facility has contracted with an emergency response contractor (Olympus Technical) to provide assistance with any incidents that cannot be handled by the facility or the fire department.  BHS - Nampa has three on-site emergency coordinators who are trained to manage all incidents that require implementation of the plan.\n\nBHS also maintains a corporate emergency spill response phone number (1-208-249-0730).  The on-call technical support employee is immediately available to provide assistance during an incident.  The on-call staff acts as backup to the on-site emergency coordinators.\n\nVI.  Planned Improvements to Safety Program\n\nBHS is committed to accident prevention and, accordingly, maintains an excellent reputation in the chemical distribution industry.  A primary planned improvement to BHS's safety program is an update of the training materials (e.g., videos and handouts and lesson plans) to meet revised regulatory requirements.\n\nIntroduction\nBHS ACQUISITION (BHS) is multi-national wholesale distributor of chemical products.  Personnel trained in the safe handling and storage of chemicals, including bulk commodity, non-bulk quantities and compressed gases, operate each BHS branch.\n\nEvery BHS branch varies in chemical inventory, equipment and means of chemical handling.  Although every branch is different, the processes for handling chemicals are similar.  Primarily, at the BHS Nampa branch, the covered RMP process is storage only.  \n\nIncorporated by Reference \n\nAll of the following items are mentioned in the text of the Risk Management Program for the Nampa branch and are incorporated by reference.\n\nRMP Report \n\n\tThe report generated by the EPA's RMP*Submit TM  containing all the information submitted to the EPA, and is included in Appendix 1 (the RMP*Submit Generated Report) of this document.\n\nPSM (Process Safety Management) \n\n\tInformation obtained from BHS developed PSM plans in accordance with OSHA's PSM regulations,"
