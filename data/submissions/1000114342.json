The worse-case scenario is unlikely to occur because the aqua would be contained in the diked secondary containment structure, and because of operational and maintenance procedures in place to prevent a release.  The alternate release scenario is rupture of a 2-inch diameter aqua transfer hose.  The rate of release is calculated at 685 gpm of aqua and the duration of the release is estimated at 2-minutes before human intervention stops the flow.  This scenario would result in a release of 1,370-lbs. of ammonia with a calculated distance to the toxic endpoint of less than 0.1-miles.  The area surrounding the facility is flat terrain, and is predominately urban to the north and rural to the south.\n\nThe facility Plan complies with the U.S. EPA Risk Management regulations under 40 CFR 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations under 19 CCR Division 2 Chapter 4.5.  The covered process is subject to Program 2 requirements.  Prevention of accidental releases of aqua ammonia is achieved through proper process design, standardized loading and unloading procedures, operator training, and a preventative maintenance program that includes inspection and testing of equipment.  Emergency equipment includes a storage tank vent to protect from excess pressure, and a local emergency shutoff valve on the fill line.\n\nDuring the past 5 years, the facility has had no accidental releases of aqua ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan that provides evacuation procedures and notification contact information.  Employees receive annual training on the plan and periodically participate in evacuation drills.  The facility hazmat response team is qualified to"

      "SummaryText": "SIMPLOT GROWER SOLUTIONS - ORLAND CALIFORNIA:  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe purpose of the facility Aqua Ammonia Risk Management Plan is to prevent the accidental release of aqueous ammonia solutions into the workplace, the surrounding community, and the environment, and to set forth procedures to control and mitigate a release if one was to occur.   It is the policy of the J. R. Simplot Company to manufacture, handle, transport, store, and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state, and local environmental, health, & safety laws, while reducing the risks to human health, safety, and the environment.  This policy applies to all groups, divisions, operations, and departments of the J. R. Simplot Company, including the Simplot Grower Solutions (SGS) facility located at 1536 S. Railroad Avenue, Orland, Glenn County, California.  Facility management is expected to implement, and all employees are expected to comply with, the spirit and letter of this policy.\n\nSGS Orland is an agricultural retail store, providing ag-related products and services to area farmers.  The facility stores and handles bulk dry and liquid fertilizers, and performs both dry and liquid custom fertilizer blending.  Packaged fertilizers and pesticides are stored and sold to farmers for agricultural use.  Bulk herbicides are stored and repackaged for sale to farmers.  The regulated substance stored and handled at this location is aqua ammonia (aqua), which is a liquid fertilizer product containing 24% ammonia in water.  Aqua is received at the facility via tank truck, and is offloaded into an aboveground 7,800-gallon storage tank.  For delivery, aqua is transferred from the storage tank into bobtail trailers, then shipped to customers as 20% nitrogen liquid fertilizer.\n  \nThe worst-case release scenario for the facility is a catastrophic failure of the 7,800-gallon aqua storage tank.  Given a maximum fill level of 95%, this event would cause a spill of 7,410-"
