      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) Hambert Compressor Station (Station). Because this station is not normally occupied under the guidelines found in 29CFR1910.119, it is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard. However, APC has decided proactively to apply the standard to the station to provide a higher standard of safety.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. APC has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies. If the situation requires, will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nLocation and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Hambert Compressor Station is located in Weld County near the intersection of Weld County Road 38 and Weld County Road 35 in a rural area, which is used primarily for farming.\r\n\r\nThe Station consists of seven compressor units that discharge 60 MMCF/D through to delivery points with a MAOP of 1,220 psig on the discharge side of the compressors. The station is equipped with inlet separation. Liquids separated (condensate) are injected into the station's discharge.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the water and hydrocarbon dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission. Control of the water dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that need to b"

      "SummaryText": "e removed.  The amount of water and hydrocarbons in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The water is removed from the gas stream using a tri-ethylene glycol dehydrator and the heavier hydrocarbons are removed using a JT skid to cool the gas below the hydrocarbon dew point.  The hydrocarbons recovered from the JT skid are injected into a pipeline and taken to a processing plant for further processing.  The station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant. \r\n\r\nThe Stations maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances. Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\r\n\r\nHistory and Ownership\r\n\r\nThe Hambert Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1970's. The compressor station was sold to Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in 1993 and who maintained operations through December 1, 1999. In 1999, HS Resources bought the station and operated it until 2001.\r\n\r\nIn August 2001, Kerr McGee (KMG) acquired HS Resources and continued operations until APC acquired Kerr McGee in 2006. The station was expanded in 2012-13 to accommodate the increasing amount of gas being produced as the result of the horizontal drilling programs being conducted in the DJ Basin.\r\n\r\nProgram Level\r\n\r\nAPC has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Hambert Compressor Station for the following reasons: \r\n\r\n1.\tThe station has a documented Emergency Response Plan, which has been coordinated with the local fire department;\r\n2.\tThe station has not had a accidental release of the regulated substances (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused death, injury, or response/restoration activity for an environmental receptor in the previous five years; and \r\n3.\tThe distance to any receptors is greater than then calculated endpoin"

This plan is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThere have not been any accidents in the past five years that meet the criterion for inclusion with this submittal."
