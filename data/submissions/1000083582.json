This commitment is demonstrated by the resources investing in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The objective of risk management is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, BTEC's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing a set of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS). In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against an international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to the requirements of ISO 14001. After an extensive review, which included a number of audits of various ExxonMobil Corporation facilities, Lloyd's concluded that the \"environmental components of the OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard.\" They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil Corporation to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nExxonMobil Baytown Technology & Engineering Complex (BTEC), located in Baytown, Texas,\r\nU.S.A., operates a variety of processes for conducting both fundamental and applied research in the development of new and improved processes and products for manufacturing basic and intermediate chemicals, commodity and specialty poly"

EPA's\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP) provisions. However, the only areas affected by the processes are limited to workers at the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant and ExxonMobil Refinery surrounding the BTEC properties.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at BTEC. This section addresses the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information,\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and \r\nCompliance Audits. The accident prevention program at BTEC equally covers all individually listed regulated substances, flammable mixtures, and toxic substances.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nBTEC encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.\r\nEmployees have access to information created as part of the BTEC accident prevention program, which is document in an employee participation plan that is maintained at BTEC. In addition, BTEC has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personnel safety.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The specific business groups within BTEC are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, BTEC has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. BTEC ensures that the process is maintained within these safe limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\r\n\r\nBTEC also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nBTEC has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and control"

BTEC primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards on the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team. This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned a greater risk receive attention first. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are complete. The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with design safety features, BTEC periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process. These hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nBTEC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\r\n(1) initial startup;\r\n(2) normal operations;\r\n(3) temporary operations;\r\n(4) emergency shutdown;\r\n(5) emergency operations;\r\n(6) normal shutdown; and,\r\n(7) start-up following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.\r\nThese procedures are used"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, BTEC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in BTEC operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests and/or skills demonstrations) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on key operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
