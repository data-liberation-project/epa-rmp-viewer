Protecting the health and safety of and Fox Metro\u0092s employees as well as the general public during wastewater treatment activities is the primary objective. Fox Metro prides itself in its excellent operating record. The facility was first constructed ion 1929. In the last 50 years, no accidents have occurred in which would put the public or the environment at risk.\nFox Metro developed a safety committee, which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the safety rules and procedures. This committee meets monthly. The committee is made up of management and labor representatives, which act as a resource for the District. the safety committee is responsible for accident and injury records, development and implementation of the safety and education program, safety inspections and safety standard compliance.\nFox Metro treats and average of 35 million gallons of wastewater, with a design average flow of 42 mgd. The general process for treating wastewater utilizes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove pollutants. First, bar screens and grit chambers remove large debris while primary settling basins permit smaller particles to settle out from the influent flow stream. The flow is subsequently mixed with activated sludge (bacteria) which remove organic pollutants through bacterial metabolism. These bacteria are then allowed to deposit in secondary settling tanks. Finally, the flow is passed through cloth filters, disinfected during required disinfection seasons, and discharged to the Fox River at levels below the regulatory compliance standards allowed by the NPDES permit.\nThis risk management plan (RMP) was created to address methane only. Other chemicals that are utilized by Fox Metro do not exceed the mandated threshold quantities. Methane is a flammable gas which"

Anaerobic digesters are large tanks where bacterial activities are utilized to decompose organic solids from wastewater. These organic solids are called sludge. The process of anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge eliminates pathogenic organisms, reduces the volume of materials that require ultimate disposal, creates a sludge that can be easily dried and utilized for farmland enhancement, and created gasses that can be used as a fuel supply.  \nFox Metro operates a temperature phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) process for processing its biosolids.  There are four fixed dome anaerobic digesters (M1, M2, M3 and M5) and a fixed domed intermediate storage tank (IS tank).  A fifth digester, M4, is currently used for storage, where 3,000 cubic feet per minute of fresh is pulled through the tank, there is no potential for methane accumulation in the tank. M1 and M2 are used as thermophilic digesters and Digesters M3 and M5 are used as mesophilic digesters.  Both the thermophilic and mesophilic process produce methane.  The intermediate tank is also operated under anaerobic conditions. All of these tanks produce methane.  \nThe digesters, IS tank, and associated piping store approximately 19,918pounds of gas and the capacity of the sphere is approximately 6,945 pounds. Therefore, the total maximum amount of digester gas present on site in any one day is 26,863 pounds.\n According to Fox Metros 2024 digester gas data, the gas created from the TPAD process varies from digester to digester and throughout the year but is approximately 63.5% methane, 37.5 % carbon dioxide, 1.3% nitrogen and 1.5% water.  The gas is collected from the digesters and can be used to fuel the boilers for the TPAD process, or stored in a sphere for later use.  Any additional gas is flared by two permitted, on-site waste gas burners.\nRMP* Comp, a software modelling program created by the Chemical emergency Prevention and preparedness Of"

      "SummaryText": "fice of the EPA, the NOAA, and Cameo team of the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division was utilized for two scenarios: a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario. Appendix F: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants of the EPA Risk Management Plan Guidance was extensively consulted for determining modelling scenarios. The worst-case release scenario modelled was a vapor cloud explosion of all the methane from the largest vessel, in this case, the sphere. Instantaneous failure of the sphere could potentially produce a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.20-mile radius. The modelled alternative scenario was a slower release from the sphere over a ten-minute time period and a subsequent explosion. Failure of the gas sphere would cause a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.10-mile radius.\nRelease prevention program,\nThe Release Prevention Program consists of mainly employee health and safety training, preventative maintenance, and strict operating procedures. Employees are trained immediately upon employment and updated annually thereafter on proper welding and cutting procedures, lock-out/tag-out procedures, proper lifting, hand safety, forklift operation, hazard communication, fire extinguisher training, and first aid/CPR. Preventative maintenance prevents breakdowns, reduces wear, improves efficiency, and extends the life of equipment and structures while enhancing the reliability and dependability of the wastewater treatment equipment. Strict operating procedures ensure that the proper startup/shut down sequences are utilized when operating equipment. The IEPA Bureau of Air conducts periodic inspections with regards the sphere and digesters. The most recent inspection occurred in September 2024.

Additionally, Fox Metros\u0092 liability insurance carrier requires a risk inspection as part of the policy compliance with the most recent inspection completed in 2023. No deficiencies were noted by the Village of Oswego nor the insurance carrier. Additionally, a full internal and external integrity test of the sphere and associated ancillary gas conveyance and safety equipment was performed by two independent inspection contractors in October 2023. These inspections confirmed that there were no safety issues with the sphere.\nFive-year accident History\nFox Metro has had no accidental release of methane in the last five years. No one either on-site or off-site had been injured in association with the methane, and no emergency evacuations have resulted.\nEmergency Response Program\nAn emergency response plan is in place at fox Metro in case that an emergency was to occur. The employee(s) first aware of an emergency would notify the emergency response center who in turn would immediately notify the appropriate emergency responders (Oswego Fire Department, and Kendall County Sherriff\u0092s Department). Select employees at the facility have been assigned duties in the event of an emergency and are trained to fulfill those duties to assist professional emergency responders."
