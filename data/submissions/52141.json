The plant processes natural gas delivered from wells.  The plant processes consists of separation of natural gas liquids (NGL).  The NGL product is stored in three NGL storage tanks.  The product is sold and shipped via truck.\nProgram Level\nIt has been determined that this is a Program 1 facility.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the range of the worst case release scenario.  This facility is subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility?s Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Mountrail County Local Emergency Planning Committee(LEPC) and agency personnel will tour the facility.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corp.  takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThe facility contains a simple NGL product storage and shipping process.  Butane, propane and pentane are the primary components of the NGL inventory listed in the RMP rule.  Propane is used as refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\nRelease Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario is that the single largest container is released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  No active mitigation is conside"

      "SummaryText": "red.  Worst case meteorological conditions are assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable mixture vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.2 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 138,607 pounds in ten minutes for the NGL process.  \nThere are no public receptors within this distance. There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\nAccident History\nThis is a new facility and therefore, has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.   The plan is designed to protect personnel on the site, to ensure their safe and orderly evacuation in event of an emergency, and to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel."
