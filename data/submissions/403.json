Delta Pride has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for Delta Pride utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium.  The System contains eight (8) high stage compressors and six (6) low stage compressors.  The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling on nine of the compressors and water cooled oil coolers on the remaining five (5) compressors.\n\nThe System contains eight (8) evaporative condensers to convert the high pressure ammonia gas into high pressure liquid.  After the high pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory of 17,800 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia, includes three (3) high stage recirculators which provide high temeprature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes three (3) low stage recirculators which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.\n\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the low temperature recirculators to the suction of the low stage compressors.  The discharge from the low stage compressors goes to the high stage recirculators, which provide ammonia vapor to the suction of the high stage compressors.  The discharge from the high stage compressors provides high temperature ammonia gas to the evaporative condensers.\n\nTh"

The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the Delta Pride Refrigeration System in good operation.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases at Delta Pride during the last five (5) years.\n\nThe equipment listed below is inspected daily.\n\nall refrigeration compressors\nall ammonia pumps\nall condensers\nall ice houses\nall heat exchangers\nall spiral freezers\n\nShould there be an ammonia release, the Indianola, Mississippi Fire Department (IFD) will respond.

The IFD provides emergency response training to designated Delta Pride Emergency Response Team personnel.  Should the need for an evacuation occur, the Indianola Police Department (IPD) will notify all households identified by the IFD to be within the 1.2 mile radius.\n\nAnnual in-house employee training programs from Mississippi State "
