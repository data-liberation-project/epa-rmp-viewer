RMP Facility ID#1000 0021 1889\nJuly 2010, First Time Submission\n\nSite Information\nRAPAC LP (\"RAPAC\") operates as a manufacturer of expandable polystyrene (EPS) beads (loose fill packaging material) in Oakland, Tennessee (NAICS 32614). The facility has three aboveground storage tanks (2- 12,000 gallons and 1- 6,000 gallon capacity) onsite containing pentane (C.A.S.# 109-66-0) which is used in the formulation of the packaging products. All three tanks are maintained inside a concrete dike with a capacity to hold approximately 34,000-gallons. \n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nRAPAC is committed to providing a safe working environment. We will achieve this mission by promoting a culture in which employee safety is paramount in each and every endeavor. We will actively promote and maintain the following beliefs in everything we do:\n\nAA?    Safety performance is critically important to the success of RAPAC. \n\nAA?    Concern for employee safety will be evident and embedded into all phases of our work by design and through the business decisions that we make. \n\nAA?    Each employee is empowered with responsibility for his or her personal safety and the safety of their fellow employees and stakeholders. \n\nAA?    Continuous improvement is a way of life at RAPAC; we use feedback and experience to refine and build upon our culture to ensure continual forward progress. \n\nAA?    Safety incidents are preventable; we will strive to ensure that our policies, practices, and decisions are proactive on all accounts. \n\nAA?    Management is responsible for ensuring employees have the knowledge, skills, and equipment necessary to protect themselves and others. \n\nAA?    We will not be satisfied to simply meet safety compliance standards. \n\nAA?    Every task must be performed with concern for the welfare of ourselves, fellow employees, our contractors, our visitors, and the community in which we operate. \n\nRoles and resp"

So that the system works effectively, each person within the company must understand his/her roles and responsibilities for the overall program management and for each individual program. The success of our program depends on all employees incorporating our culture into every part of our day-to-day business practice and decisions.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nRAPAC has developed and compiled a comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction in the safe operation of facility processes covered by this risk management plan.  Procedures provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations. \n\nEach procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure.  Operating procedures are kept current through the management of change process.\n\nThe Plant Manager and Maintenance Manager bear responsibility for developing, reviewing, and approving operating procedures.  The Maintenance Manager is responsible for correctly implementing operating procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nRAPAC had one accidental release of pentane in the past five years. In February 2010, approximately 3,000 lbs of pentane was released into the concrete containment dike due to a pump failure. No one onsite or offsire was injured; however, the area 1,000 feet downwind from the release was evacuated as a precautionary measure. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe RAPAC plant is not required to establish and implement a community emergency action plan to handle releases; however, the plant maintains an internal emergency action plan containing specific procedures for prompt response to emergencies that impac"

All employees are trained on this plan during new-hire training and receive refresher training on a routine basis.\n\nThe RAPAC plant maintains a working relationship with the City of Oakland Fire Department, the Fayette County Fire Department, and the Fayette County Emergency Management Agency. These agencies are knowledgeable regarding the risks associated with the pentane system and response procedures during an emergency. \n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nRAPAC is planning to improve and upgrade the pentane storage and release monitoring system to provide additional release prevention mechanisms and make it easier to operate and maintain the system as a whole. In addition, new process controls will be implemented at the pentane system that will trigger revisions to the system training program and emergency response action plans. \n\n"
