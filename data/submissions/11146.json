However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Seminole Gas Processing plant achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n7 A commitment to OSHA's PSM and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's RMP, DOT's Pipeline Safety and Texas Railroad Commission Rule 36 regulations which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n7 Development and use of Amerada Hess Corporation and Seminole Gas Processing Plant safety, operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n7 Knowledge of and adhe"

The Seminole Gas Processing Plant identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Wilfred Baker Engineering Company of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 724 feet (0.14 miles) from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Propylene Accumulator storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (80% at 60F). The maximum distance beyond the plant property boundary is 135 feet, which enters into the Amerada Hess Seminole District pipeyard. Since the plant is located in a sparsely populated area, this worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Amerada Hess.\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Managment Program rule (40 CFR 86.10(b)(1)). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the executive summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area exce"

The plant processes or stores regulated flammables, such as Methane, Natural Gas Liquids and Propylene.  In addition, the plant produces and contains as by-products of processing, Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Seminole Gas Processing Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, the Seminole Gas Processing Plant has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Seminole Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding"

The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.  \n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Seminole Gas Processing Plant identified potential candidates for worst case scenarios and utilized the services of the Wilfred Baker Engineering Company of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1 psi overpressure.
