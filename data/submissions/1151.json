      "SummaryText": "A risk management plan has been implemented at Wheeler Brothers Grain Company's Canton, Oklahoma facility to provide a contingency plan in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan has been developed to prevent accidental release through responsible handling and proper storage of the product, ensure proper training and safety equipment are provided for our employees, and to make the surrounding community aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\nWheeler Brother's Canton facility is primarily a grain elevator as well as a fertilizer and chemical dealership.  The only regulated substance which qualifies under the Clean Air Act of 1990 in quantities above the minimum threshhold is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient.  Two 12,000 gallon storage tanks are located at this site.  Neither contain anhydrous ammonia at more than 85% of capacity.\n\nAs required by EPA guidelines the following worst-case release and alternative release scenarios have been devised as follows:\n\n     Worst-case Scenario:  Failure or rupture of 12,000 gallon storage tank containing 53,000   \n     pounds of anhydrous ammonia (85% of capacity) released over a 10 minute period.  Under\n     the worst weather conditions the contents could travel .70 miles (Degadis model) before \n     dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\n     Alternative release Scenario:  Failure of 1\" transfer hose and the release of 3,000 pounds\n     of anhydrous ammonia over a 2 minute period.  Under the worst weather conditions the \n     contents could travel .20 miles (Degadis model) before dispersing enough to no longer pose\n     a hazard to the public.\n\nWheeler Brothers accidental release prevention program at the Canton location falls under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards at 29 CFR 1910.111 for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "as also implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.  Maintaining our facilities, equipment and employee training program in accordance with these guidelines is merely a starting point.  We have taken additional steps to prevent accidental releases.  These include the installation of valve locks and a security fence around the storage tank and fill station to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at this location in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nAs part of our emergency response program, this facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n          Wheeler Brothers Grain Company\n          202 W Santa Fe\n          P.O.
