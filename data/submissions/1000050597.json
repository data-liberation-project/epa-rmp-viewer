Polyvinyl Fluoride is the polymer used in TEDLAR(R), which is a film product with multiple applications.  The polymer is produced at Fayetteville Works and shipped to other DuPont sites for final processing.  The regulated substance Vinyl Fluoride is used in the Polyvinyl Fluoride manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe DuPont Fayetteville Works is in compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  Our Process Safety Management system includes a documented process technology system detailing the hazards of the materials, equipment design basis and the process design basis.  Periodic Process Hazards Analyses are conducted to review the entire process to insure safe operation and compliance with design guidelines.  Materials of construction are strictly controlled to insure the mechanical integrity of the systems.  Extensive operating"
