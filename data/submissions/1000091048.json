      "SummaryText": "This report is intended to provide a Risk Management Plan for the isobutane tank stored at the Spin Master facility located on 3002 Anaconda Rd in Tarboro, NC. The tank holds isobutane that is used to fuel two extruders located inside the facility. The tank has a capacity of 6,555 gallons and if roughly 20 feet long with a diameter of 10 feet. This tank is stationary roughly 5 feet off the ground. Isobutane is only fed into the tank by the supplier, Amcor, Inc. and only removed from the tank through a controlled pump system. Isobutane is removed from the tank using a low-pressure pump located next to the tank. This low-pressure pump feeds two high-pressure pumps located within the facility. These pumps are checked daily to ensure that they are operating correctly. The following handling and storage guidelines have been put in place to create a safe environment. The tank is always kept stationary within a locked gate with signs that inform flammable liquid is stored within the gate. Access is limited to Amcor, Inc. employee refilling tank and Spin Master maintenance staff when necessary. Smoking and open flames are prohibited within the enclosed area (at least 20 feet of the tank) and is only allowed in the designated smoking area on site (480 feet away).\n\nBased on the EPA description for denoting program levels, this process has been categorized as a Program 3 process. This process fails to meet the following criteria to allow the process to be categorized as Program 1: \"Processes with no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint from a worst-case release\"\n\n"
