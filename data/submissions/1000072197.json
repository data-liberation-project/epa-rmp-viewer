This is a structured approach to managing the safety, health, and environmental risks, which are inherent in our business.  While OIMS was not designed to meet a specific regulation, each section of the Process Safety Management (PSM)/Risk Management Program (RMP) standard can be mapped directly to an OIMS system.  The OIMS system is the overall guidance, while specific operating, mechanical, technical and / or SHE procedures support the system by providing more detailed information.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\n   The ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Finishing Plant (BRFP) is a quality producer of hydrocarbon resins.  Our products are used throughout the adhesives industry to provide \"tack\" to such familiar products such as bandaids, tape, glue sticks, and diaper tabs.  The plant, located at 12480 Scenic Highway, Baton Rouge, La., has been in business at the same location since 1968.  Only the physical separation of resin from solvent occurs at BRFP.  All process chemistry occurs at the ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Chemical Plant.  A brief description of the physical separation process is as follows: \n\n   1) resin concentrate (feed) is shipped via pipeline from the Baton Rouge Chemical Plant and is received in the BRFP storage tanks; \n\n   2) the feed is then pumped to stripping towers where solvent and light molecular weight resins are taken overhead and returned to the chemical plant; \n\n   3) the molten resin product is taken off the bottom of the towers and pumped to molten resin storage tanks; \n\n   4) the molten resin is then processed into various finished packaged forms.\n\n   Pentane is a colorless liquid with a \"gasoline\" odor.  It is used as a raw material component in the resin production and exist"

Total loss of containment of Tank 502 (which contains as much as 3,600,000 lbs of flammable mixture containing pentane) under worst possible weather conditions, and an ensuing vapor cloud explosion of this mixture, would be the worst case scenario for a flammable at the BRFP.  Offsite impact for this scenario as determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines would extend for 1.2 miles.  The alternative release scenario for the BRFP would be the result of a flange separation due to level gauge freeze during inclement weather and a subsequent pool-fire.  The amount of flammable mixture available would be 94,400 lbs/hr.  Distance of concern for this scenario would be 0.1 miles.  There are no toxic chemicals on site that exceed threshold limits.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\n   The following is a general overview of the OIMS elements supporting the PSM/RMP program at BRFP.\n\n\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Employee Participation [29 CFR 1910.119(c), 40 CFR 68.83]\n\n   OIMS 1.1 - Management, Leadership, Commitment, and Accountability:  This system provides the framework for management to set expectations, establish standards and goals, provide resources, and ensure that performance is measured, communicated, and continuously improved.

Critical equipment also includes devices which protect against breaches of security access that have the potential for serious consequences.  This system is intended to help ensure this equipment operates when called upon.\n\n   OIMS 6.4 - Mechanical Integrity:  The mechanical integrity system protects the safety and health of personnel, the environment, equipment, and satisfies applicable laws, regulations, and approved standards.  It addresses the mechanical integrity of all equipment that can impact SSH&E with a focus on prevention of loss of containment.  It applies to existing facilities, new construction, modifications to existing facilities, and replacements-in-kin"

This is achieved through comprehensive response procedures that coordinate on-site responders with Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), industry, and public agencies.  Fixed fire protection equipment is maintained on-site with additional capability provided by area ExxonMobil resources.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\n   As previously discussed, OIMS 11.1 (Assessment and Improvement) is in place to improve Operations Integrity by measuring performance relative to requirements.  Since OIMS supports PSM / RMP elements as discussed above, the assessment and improvement process under OIMS 11.1, by definition, improves overall process safety at the site.  This is accomplished through a process of internal and external OIMS assessments and follow-up.  Internal assessments are conducted annually utilizing personnel trained in the expectations OIMS.  External assessments are conducted periodically by personnel from outside the affected operation.  Team composition and frequency are consistent with the complexity of operations, regulations, and performance history.\n\n"
