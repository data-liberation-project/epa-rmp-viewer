The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 68. Both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the Process Safety Management standards as defined in the CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Section 1910.119, respectively.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nGallo Winery prepared the CalARP/RMP/PSM program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia and sulfur dioxide systems at the facility as part of the original system construction. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Gallo Winery personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, with backup emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Mat"

Gallo Winery will continue to improve ammonia and sulfur dioxide-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program.\r\n \r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Gallo Winery is located at 600 Yosemite Boulevard, Modesto, California in an area zoned for industrial use. The facility is west of Santa Rosa Avenue, which runs north and south along the east edge of the site. Gallo Winery is a family-owned business that processes wine by aging and bottling. Gallo Winery has been located at this site since 1934. The NAICS Code for the Gallo Winery is 31213.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in five independent processes at the State and Federal Program Level 3 (Program 3): four refrigeration systems and one pH adjustment of wastewater system. The ammonia refrigeration systems are closed loop systems. The process refrigeration systems contain approximately 19,729 pounds, 12,384 pounds, 12,384 pounds, and 12,660 pounds of ammonia, respectively. The refrigeration systems provide cooling to product chiller shells. The chillers are used to cool product as it circulates in sealed stainless steel tubing and across plates. A maximum of 32,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is used to adjust the pH of wastewater leaving the Gallo facility as needed to keep the pH within regulatory requirements.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is also used at the facility in two independent processes at the State Program Level 2 (Program 2): two refrigeration systems. Sulfur dioxide is used in four independent processes at Program 2: sulfur dioxide transfer, sulfur dioxide storage, finished wine sulfur dioxide injection, and sulfur dioxide transfer by Tank 3010.\r\n\r\nThe EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations have different threshold quantities of hazardous materials for their programs than the CalARP regulations have. All five Program Level 3 processes are covered by RMP, PSM and CalARP regulations. However, the si"

In addition, CalARP regulations for Program Level 2 processes are less stringent than those for Program Level 3 processes. Gallo Winery has chosen to manage its Program Level 2 processes to meet the more stringent Program Level 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe CalARP/RMP/PSM regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the Program. Program 3 requirements of the CalARP/RMP/PSM apply to the Gallo Winery facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for the facility and an alternative release scenario for each process chemical. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the CalARP/RMP.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe CalARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Gallo Winery has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration, ammonia pH adjustment, ammonium hydroxide, and sulfur dioxide handling systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is inadvertent build-up of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Gallo Winery ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control sy"

Further, the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped. \r\n\r\nThe predominant safety concern with the sulfur dioxide systems is inadvertent build-up of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to sulfur dioxide expansion (heat and/or pressure). Care must be taken to not surpass 125\u00baF (51.7\u00baC) as the fusible safety devices in the sulfur dioxide cylinders melt at 165\u00baF (74\u00baC). The three dispensing systems are equipped with sulfur dioxide scrubber systems.\r\n\r\n \r\nOther safety features at the facility include: \r\n\u00bf\temergency shutdown systems\r\n\u00bf\tsecurity monitoring of the facility around the clock 365 days per year\r\n\u00bf\tcomponent specific safety shutdowns\r\n\u00bf\tcompressor and other system safeties are tested annually\r\n\u00bf\tpressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and most other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\r\n\u00bf\tmany of the ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\r\n\u00bf\tpressure relief valves are replaced at least every 5 years\r\n\u00bf\toperators receive ongoing training in operations \r\n\u00bf\tmaintenance personnel receive ongoing training\r\n\u00bf\tfire alarms and sprinkler system \r\n\u00bf\tstandard operating procedures for the ammonia system operation\r\n\u00bf\tstandard operating procedures for operation of the sulfur dioxide systems\r\n\u00bf\tstandard operating procedures for operation of the sump wastewater pH system\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia and sulfur dioxide systems at the facility, Gallo Winery has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the systems.

Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia refrigeration, ammonia pH adjustment, and sulfur dioxide systems at the facility. The SOPs will provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\r\n\r\nGallo Winery is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia and sulfur dioxide systems. A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the preventive and corrective maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems. An inspection-based preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the sulfur dioxide systems. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection and calibration testing and overhaul of system equipment. The preventive maintenance systems are used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe CalARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the 5-year accident history at the regulated facility. Gallo Winery reported no accidental releases of sulfur dioxide at the facility during the past 5 years. A single release of anhydrous ammonia vapor occurred on (date). The release of approximately 550 pounds was not detectable at the site boundary downwind of the release. No injuries either on-site or off site occurred. As a result of the release, Standard Operating Procedures were changed, refrigeration technicians were retrained, and purchasing receiving procedures were altered in an effort to prevent further releases of a similar type from occurring.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event that ammonia and/or a sulfur dioxide release requ"
