The worst-case release scenario at the Davis Supply facility involves the release of the contents of a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes.  An offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed based on calculations provided by the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (January 27, 1999) document.  This scenario followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. These conditions were set by the EPA to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; and the assumptions do not likely reflect realistic results.  The toxic endpoint based on EPA assumptions was estimated to be to be 0.4 miles.  The population within the entire 0.5 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.4 miles for this scenario was estimated to be 969 people.  Figure 3 depicts the worst-case scenario 0.4-mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the East to depict the prevailing wind and, therefore, most likely impact direction.

      "SummaryText": "a. Davis Supply is a supplier of water treatment chemicals for small, local, public and private water treatment facilities.  The facility is located at 6012 Pine Hill Road in Port Richey, Florida.  A site location map is included as Figure 1 at the end of the executive summary.  This office/warehouse facility includes a chlorine storage area under roof outside the building structure, which contains 150-pound cylinders of chlorine. A maximum inventory level of 48 cylinders or 7,200 pounds of chlorine gas will be stored on site at any time.  A site drawing is included at the end of the executive summary as Figure 2.  Based on the maximum inventory levels, only chlorine is subject to the RMP standard.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release.  This facility does not fall into any of the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes as listed in the RMP standard.  As a primarily retail business (i.e. selling toend users) with less than 10 full time employees on site, this facility does not meet the requirements for regulation under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.   This facility therefore qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.  \n\nb. Currently nine (9) people are employed by the facility.  In addition to 6 drivers, there are three (3) office personnel.  The facility is generally staffed by 3-4 people during the normal business hours of 0800 hours to 1700 hours, Monday through Friday.  \n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as \u00c2\u00bfworst-case release\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfalternative release.\u00c2\u00bf  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, \u00c2\u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the\u00c2\u00bfmaximum quantity in the largest vessel\u00c2\u00bfis released as a gas over 10 minutes,\u00c2\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00c2\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case"

The only difference between the valve of a 1-ton container and 150-pound cylinder is the presence of a fusible plug on the 1-ton container.  The release rates therefore would be expected to be the same.  Based on the calculations as provided by the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (January 27, 1999) document the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated to be 0.1 miles.  Figure 4 depicts the alternative release scenario 0.1-mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the East to depict the most likely impact direction.  The population within the entire 0.03 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.1 miles for this scenario was estimated to be 38 people.
