The management and employees of the Phoenix facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride is received and stored in high pressure tube trailers that contains 3,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride in each tube.  The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT containers such as cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, would be the rupture of  a high pressure tube that contains a maximum of 3,000 lb . The results would be a maximum release of 3,000 lbs of refrigerated anhydrous hydrogen chloride over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 0.03mg/L (EPRG-2 Level) was determined to be 2.4 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 45,953 residents and several special receptors which  the Arizona state Sanitarium, Arizona State Hospital Farm and several schools based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".  Many business and industries are also within the endpoint which includes Motorola Semiconductor Complex. The environmental receptors that are affected are Papago Park which contains the Phoenix Zoo, Desert Botanical Gardens and Gov. Hunt Tomb.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable,"

This release would result in the maximum release of 600 lb anhydrous hydrogen chloride at a rate of 10 lb/min.\n\nThe release endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2) was determined to be 0.10 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include several public receptors and businesses based on actual observations. They would include the Motorola Semiconductor Complex, several smaller businesses. 114 residents were affect by this scenario based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\". No passive or active mitigation systems were considered.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and testing of the DOT containers.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen chloride.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen chloride system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen chloride.

The PHA was review and updated on November  9, 1996 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on 3/4/99 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHAs hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.

The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in February 1999.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on 2/10/99.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle hydrogen chloride has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.

BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in February 1999 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.
