Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe facility will conduct audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audit will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\nAccident History\nThe facility has not had any accidents reportable for the regulated substance under RMP. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nAztalan Bio maintains a written Emergency Response Program. The purpose of the Emergency Response Plan is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The Emergency Response Plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including medical treatment, evacuation plans, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, Aztalan Bio maintains, inspects, and tests emergency response equipment. Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan. The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs owner of this facility, Aztalan Bio will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility. As it updates procedures affecting RMP, modifications will be submitted."

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and piping & instrumentation diagrams.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\nAztalan Bio maintains written procedures that address process operations during normal, emergency, startup and shutdown situations. The facility develops and implements a training program for its employees involved in facility operations. \n\nContractors\nAztalan Bio requires its on-site contractors to attend a training program and to follow Aztalan Bio safe work practices. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nAztalan Bio conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) as may be required for its facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes inspections and equipment testing to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operational condition.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.

Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through fermentation and distillation process.\n\nThe regulated substance stored at the facility is natural gasoline, which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n1.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site. Denaturant is stored in one (1) 105,200-gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located within a berm containment structure.  A worst-case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The SDS lists several RMP-applicable constituents; however, it is assumed the entire mixture as Pentane. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 614,158 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (0.7 miles), the model results are provided as part of this documentation.
