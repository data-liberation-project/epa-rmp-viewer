If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bath Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilityA?s primary activities encompass the storage and transfer of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to and from 9 solution mined underground storage caverns and 6 30000 gallon above ground storage tanks.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are butane and propane.  \nThe maximum inventory of butane that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational limitations is 283,441,939 lbs. The maximum quantity of propane expected to be present at our facility is 14,122,278 lbs.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  This facility complies with EPAA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program"
