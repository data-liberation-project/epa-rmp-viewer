Chlorine is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers on an unenclosed, covered, concrete pad. The chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas, and is released into wastewater using a vacuum-regulated system. The maximum intended chlorine inventory at the facility is 24,000 pounds which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\n\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide in the removal of chlorine from treated wastewater. Sulfur dioxide is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers on an unenclosed, covered, concrete pad. The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquefied gas and released into wastewater using a pressurized system. The maximum intended sulfur dioxide inventory at the facility is 24,000 pounds which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.\n\n\n2.0\tPOLICIES\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are toxic chemicals and precautions must be taken in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to reduce the threat of accidental release which might result in exposure to the surrounding community and to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and industry rules, regulations, and guidelines. Chemical safety at the City of Nacogdoches WWTP is dependent upon strict operating procedures, safe handling methods, and thorough training of employees. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety devices are also inherent in the design of the facility and in the equipment used in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical processes.\n\n\n3.0\tWORST CASE/ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nEPA defines the worst-case scenario as total failure o"

The alternative-case scenario should also reach an offsite endpoint, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nAt the City of Nacogdoches WWTP, the worst-case scenario for chlorine would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas.
