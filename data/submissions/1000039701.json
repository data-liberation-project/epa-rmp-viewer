The amounts of hydrogen handled by this faclity exceeds the threshold quantities set by the EPA.It is our ploicy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Air products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspection, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, and relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel suppliment the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emrgency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the nitoifcation of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).
