      "SummaryText": "The only two chemicals present above threshold levels are chlorine and sulphur dioxide. The total volume on-site is 8,000 lbs of chlorine and 8,000 lbs of sulphur dioxide.\nThe city of Ashland has accidental release and emergency response policies in place at the Wastewater Treatment Plant. As detailed in Section 9, the treatment plant is part of the county-wide Disaster and Emergency Services (DES) group which has a plan for an accidental chlorine or sulphur dioxide release. This includes staging locations, emergency measures and public communications plans.\nThe treatment plant treats the sanitary waste from the city's residents, businesses and industries. Chlorine is used as part of the disinfection process and suphur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to discharge into the receiving stream.\nThe worst case chlorine release involves a ten minute release of a one ton chlorine cylinder. Under this scenario, chlorine could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a health hazard. Up to 3,000 residents live within this area.\nThe treatment plant has taken pro-active steps to prevent an accidental chlorine release. Plant staff have gone through emergency management training and regular maintenance is performed on the equipment. In addition, the chlorine is applied by vacuum. If the vacuum is broken, chlorine will not leak unless the vessel is ruptured.\nAs detailed previously, the treatment plant emergency response program is coordinated with the county-wide plan. Initial emergency response is provided by the Ashland Fire Department and the communication plan includes coordination with local television and radio stations as well as door-to-door contact of residents in the affected area.\nThe city is reviewing the continued use of chlorine as a disinfectant. New leak detection equipment was installed in 2006 to insure reliability and safety."
