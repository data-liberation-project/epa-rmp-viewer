              "Description": "The Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time.  These three regulated substances are mixtures.  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance(1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Terminal Storage site consists of two PP storage bullets, two storage tanks (C-6, C-16), and may receive material by barge, truck, or pipeline.  Naphtha and/or Natural Gasoline may be stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock and Propylene / Propane is stored in the bullets as feedstock.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit.  The following prevention program is linked to the RMP regulated flammable mixture Naphtha.\n\n\n\nPer 68.25(2)(ii), a Worst Case Release scenario for (Natural Gasoline) which reflects the greatest potential impact / endpoint distance, has been submitted to represent all of the regulated substances.  Per 68.28(a) the Alternative Release scenario for a Natural Gasoline (pool fire) is submitted to represent all of the flammable substances.  Modeling results for Worst Case Release and Alternative Release scenarios are on file at the plant for all of the regulated substances.  The Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard Regulations.",

              "Description": "The Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time.  These three regulated substances are mixtures.  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Terminal Storage site consists of two PP storage bullets, two storage tanks (C-6, C-16), and may receive material by barge, truck, or pipeline.  Naphtha and/or Natural Gasoline may be stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock and Propylene / Propane is stored in the bullets as feedstock.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit.  The following prevention program is linked to the RMP regulated flammable mixture (1,3 Butadiene).\n\n\n\nPer 68.25(2)(ii), a Worst Case Release scenario for (Natural Gasoline) which reflects the greatest potential impact / endpoint distance, has been submitted to represent all of the regulated substances.  Per 68.28(a) the Alternative Release scenario for a Natural Gasoline (pool fire) is submitted to represent all of the flammable substances.  Modeling results for Worst Case Release and Alternative Release scenarios are on file at the plant for all of the regulated substances.  The Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard Regulations.",

With approximately 5,000 employees, the LLC and its affiliates own more than 10.5 billion in assets, including various manufacturing and research facilities in eight countries.  Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC is equally owned by Chevron U.S.A.

These three regulated substances are mixtures.  The Propylene / Propane mixture is a feedstock that is received by barge and stored in bullets and subsequently transferred via pipeline to other Chevron Phillips manufacturing plants.  Natural Gasoline and Naphtha may be brought in by barge or pipeline and stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock for other CPChem manufacturing plants.  Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges.  However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit and are remotely located from the CPChem manufacturing main plant.

Williams, EHS Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\n\n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-835-8757) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.  Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., Emergency Response Group would also respond to any event at the Port Arthur Terminal.  The Terminal is covered by emergency procedures and processes from both the main Port Arthur facility as well as its own.  \n\n\n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard regulations and to the best of our knowledge we are in substantial compliance with these regulations.

      "SummaryText": "Arthur Terminal is continually reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work, and to minimize environmental impacts.  The Port Arthur Terminal manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization.  Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety.  We have adopted a program of continuous improvement which can involve changes to plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems.  The facility continually uses the MOC / PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified.  The facility also uses extensive facility siting procedures / requirements, to continuously evaluate personnel safety and process hazards."
