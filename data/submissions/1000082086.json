Statement of Purpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Plan is to identify those incidents, such as fire, explosion, spills or air pollution releases that would affect the surrounding community and guide the response to any such occurrence.  Site personnel are trained properly to deal with specific emergency response situations.  This Plan is written in compliance with the Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Action Section 112(e)(7).  This location is covered by this regulation because Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) is stored and processed at this site.\r\n\r\nThis Plan is designed for the employees of Akzo Nobel Coatings Inc., Emergency Responders and the general public, and contains details of specific response actions and reporting procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency.  This Plan is supported by various procedures contained in the SPCC Plan, Health and Safety Operating Procedures and Work Instructions, Emergency Response Manual, Emergency Response Pre-Plan Manuals, Emergency Action Plan, the Site Process Safety Management Program and various other plant operations manuals.\r\n\r\nB. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nVAM is delivered to the site in railcars which may be up to 25,000 gallons in capacity.  It is stored in two 15,000 gallon storage tanks prior to being pumped to the plant for processing.  VAM is pumped from the storage tanks into a weigh tank or reactor vessel inside the plant.  The reaction converts all the monomer into a non-hazardous polymer (latex).\r\n\r\nC. Worst Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nOnsite locations processes involving VAM include:\r\n\r\n1. An outside rail siding for 25,000-gallon tank car shipments, approximately 600 feet from the nearest offsite building, and 300 feet from the nearest (west) fence line.\r\n\r\n2. Two outside 15,000-gallon storage tanks in a diked area just north of the rail siding, approximately 330 feet from the nearest (west) fence line.\r\n\r\n3.  6,000-gallon reactor inside the process buil"

Review of the Site, it is clear that the RMP Worst Case Scenario is the loss of a full railcar, which would instantaneously release 25,000 gallons (190,000 pounds) of VAM.  A railcar is the largest single vessel and the cars are typically spotted as close to the nearest fence line as any other vessel.  \r\n\r\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility achieves compliance with the accidental release prevention requirement through our OSHA PSM process.  Critical components of the process are as follows:\r\n \r\n\r\nPART 1910.119(c) -- EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe facility has had a Process Safety Management Employee Participation Policy in place since April 1993.  The policy discusses employee participation in such areas as:  hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident/accident investigation, emergency planning and response, and safety and health committees.\r\n\r\nPART 1910.119(d) A\u00bf PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information pertaining to chemical, health and physical hazards of highly hazardous chemicals is met through the use of SDS's.  Information pertaining to the technology of the process can be found in the reactor procedures and batch slips for the Plant.  Additionally, to meet this requirement the facility conducts Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) to determine the consequence of deviations, including safety and health concerns and systems in-place to prevent deviations.  Information pertaining to the equipment in the process is maintained by the Plant Engineer.  P&IDs exist for all regulated processes in the plant.  Additionally, there are individual dossiers on"

Maintenance of critical pieces of equipment is monitored through the MP2 System.\r\n\r\nPART 1910.119(e) A\u00bf PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe facility conducted an initial process hazard analysis of the Plant in 1993, the latest revalidations in 2016.  The facility uses HAZOP methodologies in conducting the hazard analysis.  This hazard analysis is conducted by a team of employees with expertise in engineering and process operations and the team leader has had formal hazard analysis training.  As a result of the study, a list of recommendations is developed.  The recommendations are sent to the Site Manager and are followed up on by the HSES Manager.  Documentation of the hazard analysis and recommendations are kept on file in the HSES Department.\r\n\r\nPART 1910.119(f) A\u00bf OPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe Plant has a complete set of operating procedures for processes regulated under the standard.  The operating procedures contain sections on steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.  In the Plant these procedures are kept electronically. In addition to the operating procedures the facility maintains a set of Safety and Health Procedures and Work Instructions that address such issues as: Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, Safe Work, Hot Work, Line Breaking, Security, Contractor Safety, Emergency Action Plan, etc. Operating Procedures are reviewed on a 3 year cycle.\r\n\r\nPART 1910.119(g) A\u00bf TRAINING\r\n\r\nAll employees who work in areas covered by the standard have been provided with initial and refresher training.
