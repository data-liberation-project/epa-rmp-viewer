      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIndiana Packers Corporation is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Carroll County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system?s purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for the Indiana Packers operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Indiana Packers is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as conversed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp version 1.7 model was utilized exclusively and is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on"

      "SummaryText": " file at the Indiana Packers (Engineering office) facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software, and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIndiana Packers has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in EPA?s 40 CFR Part 68.  Indiana Packers is also subject to, and complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize a  release, if one should occur.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., LEPC, Fire Department, Sheriff Department, etc.) and if contacted, they will assist in an actual emergency. Drills are conducted Bi-annually for on-site response teams and annually with outside organizations.  Although the Safety Manager is the key 24 hour contact, Vice President of Engineering will be the contact should the Safety Manager be unavailable.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to the ammonia refrigeration safety programs are planned at this time.   However, the facility Emergency Evacuation Plan was recently updated in February of 2005. Periodically the ammonia process will be subjected to regular process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements. Facility personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
