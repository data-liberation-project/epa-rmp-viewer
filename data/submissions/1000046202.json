Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Though unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are coordinated with the Albany Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is 50,409 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Regulation under CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-if Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals of every five years. Findings related to the hazard analys"
