The Ohio Refining Division Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division is a refinery and petroleum products facility located in Canton, Ohio.  The refinery uses crude petroleum as the feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, asphalt, sulfur, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane, propylene, and butane.  Some of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  In total, the Ohio Refining Division has thirteen process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  The units are listed in the data element section.\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division also handles one toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:\r\n*  Hydrofluoric Acid that is used to produce gasoline blending components in our HF Alkylation Unit\r\nAs a result of the use of the toxic substances at Ohio Refining Division above the threshold quantities listed by the RMP rule, we have no additional processes that are covered by the RMP rule since the HF Alkylation Unit is already covered because it contains flammables. \r\n\r\n1.3.

Employee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including program development.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) teams, incident investigation teams and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all RMP information created as part of the Ohio Refining Division accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Ohio Refining Division and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include safety meetings and a health and safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  All division personnel attend the safety meetings and the health and safety committee has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and division management.\r\n\r\n1.3.2.  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Ohio Refining Division has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) as part of the operating procedures.  The Ohio Refining Division ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\nThe Ohio Refining Division also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n1.3.3.  Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Ohio Refining Division periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ohio Refining Division has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process unit. When an employee is assigned process unit operation responsibility they receive basic process operator training.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn unit process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are authorized to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\n1.3.6.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Ohio Refining Division incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\n1.3.9.  Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division has safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit process and procedure to control welding and other hot work activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\n1.3.10.

      "SummaryText": "efining Division has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\n1.3.11.  Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to help prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Ohio Refining Division management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are communicated to all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\r\n1.3.12.  Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ohio Refining Division periodically conducts audits to determine whe"

Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nOhio Refining Division maintains a 5-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule.  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention over the past 5 years.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Ohio Refining Division within the last 5 years that have resulted in offsite or onsite consequences.\r\n\r\n1.6.  Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Refining Division maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division has procedures that ad"

Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Ohio Refining Division is coordinated with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Ohio Refining Division has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, the Ohio Refining Division conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\r\n \r\n1.7.
