This facility treats the city's wastewater using Chlorine, a chemical covered by the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine is delivered to and stored at the facility in high-pressure cylinders that contain up to 2,000 pounds of liquefied Chlorine each when they are full.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant stores three containers (referred to as one-ton tanks).  The capacity of a ton container of Chlorine is 2,000 pounds.  The tare weight of a ton container ranges from 1300 to 1650 pounds.  The gross weight of a ton container is 3300 to 3650 pounds.  Also, two 150-pound Chlorine cylinders may be stored on-site.  Therefore, the maximum intended inventory for Chlorine handled or stored on-site is approximately 6,300 pounds.     \n\nThe facility's worst-case release scenario, as required by EPA, involves a sudden release of the entire contents of one full chlorine storage container over a time span of ten minutes.  The release would be mitigated (slowed down) by the fact that the chlorine would be released into the process building.  Based on the worst-case release scenario and using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres air dispersion modeling program, the distance to endpoint, or the maximum threat zone for the Chlorine concentration level of concern is estimated at 1.4 miles.     \n\nThe alternative release scenario, one that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, involves a leak through the valve opening in the container.  The release rate would be slower than the worst-case scenario, and the offsite impact area would be smaller.  Based on the alternative release scenario and using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres air dispersion modeling program, the distance to endpoint, or the maximum threat zone for the Chlorine conc"

In the event of a release, all City of Bardstown WWTP personnel are to leave the area immediately for staging at a designated facility response point and notify 911.   The Emergency Response Plan will be activated.  This response plan has been coordinated with the LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Commission).  A public notification system has been developed.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety are typically identified and evaluated through the facility's Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning Programs."
