Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Cook?s Ham to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Cook?s will also comply with all Federal, State, and local laws.  The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Cook?s Ham takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe facility Environmental Coordinator is responsible for the overall management of the IRM-PSM ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCook?s Ham produces pork products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool or freeze the food products and production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the Lincoln, NE facility is approximately 54,000 pounds.   Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the facility. \n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Cook?s Ham ? Lincoln, NE facility has a program level 3 accidental release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard and EPA?s Risk Mana"
