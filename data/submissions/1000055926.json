The chlorine is used as a standard part of daily operations at the facility. EPA issued revisions to the RMP regulations on April 9, 2004 that required facilities covered by 40 CFR 68 to submit additional information, regardless of the timing of their next 5-year update.\r\n\r\nFHSD originally submitted their RMP on June 15, 1999, in compliance with the June 21, 1999 deadline.  In 2001, the facility switched to 1-ton chlorine cylinders necessitating an update to the RMP.  As the modified plan was submitted in 2001, FHSD's next update would be due in 2006.  FHSD has elected to file this fully updated RMP, in compliance with the April 9, 2004 regulatory revisions, instead of only submitting the requisite information. EPA's guidance stated that all changes to the RMP may be made using RMP*Submit 2004, except for updates to the Executive Summary.  The method now used to submit the RMP to the EPA , is RMP e*Submit.\r\n\r\nFHSD uses a series of safe handling procedures to ensure the proper handling of the 1-ton chlorine cylinders and safe handling of chlorine throughout the wastewater treatment plant.  These procedures are documented in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The SOPs are clearly visible in the chlorine building, and are reviewed as part of initial and annual refresher training. These procedures include: safe handling for loading and unloading chlorine cylinders; start-up; normal operations; cylinder change-out; normal shut-down; and temporary operations.\r\n\r\nFHSD operates a redundant chlorine alarm system with a full emergency power back-up system.  The system is tested on a routine basis. Should a chlorine gas leak occur, the building is automatically sealed and vapors are directed through the wet-scrubber. The system automatically notifies th"

Using the process change management system per the Process Safety Management Plan, FHSD successfully implemented the new system and updated this RMP with the necessary changes in 2001.\r\n\r\nFuture plans to improve safety include continuing to provide various safety training courses for employees. \r\n\r\nFHSD is a Wastewater Treatment Plant included in SIC Code 4952 and NAICS Code 22132.
