In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should\n\nalso be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actua"

Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to\n\nensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 49,347 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 10,000 lbs threshold for EPA RMP and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities and over the 500 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.
