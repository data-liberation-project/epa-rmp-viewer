This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal response policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment.  The Simi Valley WQCP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases and is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people.  To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Simi Valley County Sanitation District Water Quality Control Plant is a tertiary water treatment facility.  Wastewater, collected from homes, businesses and industries, flows via the City of Simi Valley's sewer system to the WQCP.  The plant is located at the west end of the city at 600 West Los Angeles Avenue.  \nThe Simi Valley WQCP treats both the liquid and solid constituents found in the wastewater.  The process of wastewater treatment can be divided into four general categories: preliminary treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment.  \n\nThe processes include:\n7 Mechanical Bar Screens\n7 Grit Removal Facilities\n7 Primary Sedimentation Tanks\n7 Flow Equalization\n7 Rotating Biological Contactors\n7 Activated Sludge Treatment\n7 Secondary Sedimentation\n7 Anaerobic Digestion\n7 Dual Media Filtration\n7 Chlorination\n\nThe final treated water is discharged to the Arroyo Simi, which forms the southern boundary of the treatment plant site.  \n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated substance under RMP and CalARP.   The chlorination system at Simi Valley WQCP is the main part of the tertiary wastewater treatment system.  The chlorination system converts liquid chlorine to chlorine gas and injects the gas into a solution that is used in several plant processes, primarily"

      "SummaryText": "for final effluent disinfection.  Liquid chlorine is stored in a 25-ton (5,000 gallon) bulk chlorine storage tank that stores up to 40,000 pounds of chlorine, and in four one-ton cylinders.  During normal operations, only the bulk storage tank is used, and the one-ton cylinders are in standby.  Chlorine flows form the bulk storage tank to evaporators under pressure where a hot water bath is used to raise the liquid temperature to convert the liquid to a gas. A vacuum is created in an ejector that pulls the gaseous chlorine through chlorinators that control and measure the flow of gaseous chlorine.  The gaseous chlorine is mixed with plant effluent water, and the solution is distributed to several locations in the plant.\n\nAdditional safety systems include the following:\n\nLeak Detection.  Three leak detectors located at the chlorination facilities: one is located at the chlorine storage facilities between the chlorine bulk storage tank and the empty sulfur dioxide bulk storage tank.  The second leak detector is located on the west wall of the chlorination room, and the third one is located near the one-ton cylinders.\n\nIf the leak detector detects chlorine gas in the chlorination room, the leak detector automatically activates two wall mounted exhaust fans on the east wall of the room.  In addition, the leak detector activates four solid red lights, and one flashing red light, one over each doorway in the chlorination building.  It activates a horn over the southeast corner of the building.  Third, the leak detector activates and annunciator for the Chlorination Room at local control panel and at the main control panel in the Operations Building. \n\nIf a chlorine leak occurs in the storage area, the leak detector activates the horn and four flashing red lights.  A light is mounted on each side of the rectangular cover, which covers the containers and storage tanks.  The leak detection also activates an annunciator for the storage area at local control panel and at the m"

When chlorine is detected, the sensor activates the DANGER light fires and then the ALARM light.  The set-point for the ALARM light is 1 ppm. \n\nAutomatic Shutoff Valve.  An automatic shutoff valve is mounted on the liquid chlorine line that extends from the bulk storage tank to the evaporators.  If a leak in the supply line should develop, a low pressure switch automatically closes the automatic valve too prevent further leakage from the bulk storage tank.  In addition, the low pressure switch activates an annunciator at the local control panel in the Chlorination Building.\n\nPressure Relief Valve. The chlorine bulk storage tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve that is set to discharge at 225 psig.  A pressure relief valve and rupture disc are also mounted on the chlorine gas line where the chlorine gas exists the evaporator.  The rupture disc is set to rupture at 400 psig, and the relief valve is set to vent at 560 psig.  The relieved gas from the relief valve is discharged to the chlorine vent piping . \n\nRupture Disks and Expansion Chambers.  The liquid chlorine fill line and withdrawal lines to and from the bulk storage tank are equipped with expansion tanks and rupture discs.  If chlorine is trapped in the fill and withdrawal line, and the pressure rises above the rupture disc pressure of 400 psig, the disc ruptures and the expansion tank provides additional volume for reducing the line pressure.  If the rupture disc fails, a pressure switch on the expansion tank will indicate a high pressure condition at the local control panel for chlorination in the chlorination building. \n\nExcess Flow Valves.  The lines for withdrawing liquid chlorine, which extend to the bottom of the chlorine bulk storage tank, are equipped with excess flow check valves.

      "SummaryText": "ne.  If a shutoff valve breaks off, the excess flow check valve will prevent leakage. \n\nFusible Plugs.  All ton containers are equipped with fusible metal type safety relief devices, called fusible plugs.  Most ton containers have six fusible plugs, three at each end, spaced 120 degrees apart.  In the event of a fire or other high temperatures, the fusible plug is designed to melt between 150 F and 165 F to relieve pressure and prevent a catastrophic rupture of the container.\n\nVacuum Regulator.  The chlorine gas exiting the evaporator is under pressure.  After the chlorine gas exits the evaporator and is filtered, it flows through an automatic shutoff valve/ vacuum regulator, which regulates the transition from gas flow under pressure to gas flow under vacuum.  If a low water bath temperature develops at the evaporator, the liquid chlorine may not be thoroughly heated to produce the chlorine gas.  If this condition occurs, the automatic shutoff valve closes to prevent liquid chlorine from being drawn into the vacuum lines and chlorinator.  This valve shuts off if temperature drops below 1500F. \nChlorinator Vacuum Switches. Each chlorinator has vacuum switches for sensing high vacuum and loss of vacuum.  If the ejector draws excessive vacuum, the high vacuum switch activates a high vacuum annunciator at the local control panel.  If there is a leak or a break in the vacuum lines delivering chlorine to the ejectors, the vacuum regulator shuts off and the loss of vacuum switch activates a loss of vacuum annunciator at the local control panel. \n\nAir Pack.  Several 30 minute SCBAs are stored in the safety storage container located west of the Administration/Operations Building.  Air is also supplied to operators by a tether system located at the chlorine building.

The grate is tilted upward and held in place with a chain.  If any weight is placed on the grating, the chain opens the valve, which starts the flow of water.  \n\nFire Extinguishers. There are five multipurpose fire extinguishers in the chlorination building.  One fire extinguisher is located adjacent to each doorway. \n\nRepair Kits. Two chlorine repair kits are stored in the chlorination building.  The Chlorine Institute Type B repair kit for the 1-ton containers is designed to repair leaks at container valves, fusible plugs, or minor leaks in the ton containers themselves.  The Chlorine Institute Type C repair kit for bulk storage tanks is designed to repair leaks at the angle shut-off valves and the pressure relief valve. \nOther Safety Systems.  A storage room adjacent to the Control Room in the chlorination building houses the air bottles, chlorine emergency repair kits, and miscellaneous safety equipment and appurtenances. \nA windsock is located on top the filters directly east of the chlorine storage facilities.  The windsock provides an immediate indication of the wind direction and subsequent direction of a potential gas leak. Another windsock is located on digester number 3, north of the chlorine building. \n\nAll conditions annunciated at the local control panel in the Chlorination Building are grouped together to activate a common alarm for chlorination at the main control panel in the Operations Building. \nAccess to the Simi Valley WQCP is controlled with a fence and a gate, which is locked between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m.  The chlorination room is remains locked when not in use.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe of"

      "SummaryText": "fsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as worst case and alternative release scenarios.  The worst-case scenario requires that the release of the entire contents of the single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for offsite impacts from chlorine.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed to reduce off-site impacts under the worst-case release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario used for Simi Valley WQCP is the rupture of the chlorine bulk storage tank, and the release of the entire contents in 10 minutes.  Administrative controls are used to limit the filling of the bulk tank to only 40,000 lbs. The release rate will, accordingly, be 4,000 pounds per minute (lbs/min).  In practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant.\n\nThe released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA model DEGADIS, version 3.0.3.  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency respond planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP was 3 ppm.  In addition all required EPA-model input parameters where included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (110 degree F), and average humidity (64 percent).  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or h"

      "SummaryText": "uman input.  The alternate release scenario considered was a chlorine release resulting from a leak in a valve packing located inside the chlorination building.  Because the release is assumed to occur inside a building, building mitigation was used for this scenario.  Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 5.56 lbs./min.  The same modeling approach was used as for the worst case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more common conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.3 meters per second, average air temperature of 67 degrees F, and average humidity of 64 percent. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicate that the alternative release scenario has an offsite impact.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Simi Valley WQCP during the last 5 years.  Some minor, incidental releases may have occurred over this period, but they were quickly handled by staff, were neutralized, or posed no safety or health hazards.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nSimi Valley WQCP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supplies, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine and detectors and alarms.\n\nSimi Valley WQCP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n7 Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders,  and contractors\n7 Comprehensive preventive maintenance progr"

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Simi Valley Water Quality Control Plant (Simi Valley WQCP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses.  Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we take providing the environment safe disinfected water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  Please feel free to contact Deputy Director/Sanitation Services at Simi Valley WQCP if you have any questions.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and  Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Simi Valley and the Simi Valley WQCP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nIn fact, Simi Valley WQCP won three consecutive Tri-County Plant of the Year Awards.  Most recently, in 1995, Simi Valley WQCP received the State Plant of the Year Award for plants greater than 10 million gallons per day (mgd). \n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCF) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5."
