Warehouse storage of Micatin is the sole RMP applicable process at the facility.  Storage is in cardboard shipping boxes containing four ounce steel cans on pallets.\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nWhile the chances of a worst-case situation actually occurring are incalculable, such a scenario by definition is within the realm of possibility.  That is why the EGLC?s first emergency management priority is accidental release prevention.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios were modeled using EPA?s RMP*Comp v1.07.\n\nTo protect the facility?s employees, the surrounding community and the environment; the EGLC?s operations adhere to the RMP Rule Prevention Program 1 elements.\n\n(d) General accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps\nThe center is access controlled via key card and manned guard station.
