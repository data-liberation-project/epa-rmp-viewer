      "SummaryText": "PREVENTION & RESPONSE POLICY\nJohnston Farms uses a comprehensive environmental management system approach to integrate both accidental release prevention and emergency response requirements under the \"One Plan\" format.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nJohnston Farms is a potato, bell pepper, and citrus farming operation with retail produce sales at the main office.  Ton containers of chlorine are used to sanitize produce wash water and treat irrigation resevoir water.  A qualified vendor is responsible for the chlorine handling and water treatment apparatus.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case toxic gas relese scenario is considered to be a ton container of chlorine releasing its entire contents in ten minutes under specified weather conditions.  A second worst case scenario is addressed pursuant to 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2)(iii).\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative toxic gas release scenario is considered to be a ruptured valve on the chlorine ton container with a maximum release rate of 15 pounds per minute under typical weather conditions.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nJohnston Farms has integrated the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) requirements within a comprehensive environmental mangement system based on the \"One Plan\" format.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nJohnston Farms has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nJohnston Farms uses a comprehensive environmental management system approach to integrate both accidental release prevention and emergency response requirements under the \"One Plan\" format.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAll chlorine containers will be secured to anchored truncheons or otherwise chocked and secured while in service or storage.  All regulated substance storage areas will be labeled with the appropriate National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) hazard warning placards."
