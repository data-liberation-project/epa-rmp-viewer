In order to cleanse the processed water of any bacteria, pathogens, or viruses, the\n\nEdgewater WWTP uses chlorine to disinfect water at its modern facility located in Edgewater,\n\nFlorida.\n\n\n\nChlorine is one of the best disinfection substances currently produced and has the advantage of\n\nremaining in water as a residual to continue to disinfect any bacteria that may come in contact\n\nwith the wastewater in the pipe lines.  Like other wastewater utilities, the WWTP is required to\n\nsafely store the chlorine gas.  Chlorine gas is relatively inexpensive and operators are very\n\nfamiliar with handling chlorine.  Chlorine is stored under pressure in the liquid form in special\n\nchlorine cylinders.  A maximum of 4 tons of chlorine is typically stored at the water treatment\n\nplant, and new deliveries of chlorine are made monthly.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide is used to remove the chlorine from the recycled wastewater prior to discharging\n\nthe water back to the environment.  Like other wastewater utilities, the WWTP is required to\n\nsafely store the sulfur dioxide gas.  Sulfur dioxide is very efficient at removing chlorine from the\n\nwater.  A maximum of 3 tons of sulfur dioxide is stored at the wastewater treatment plant, and\n\nnew deliveries of sulfur dioxide are made monthly.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas and sulfur dioxide are respiratory irritants and potentially toxic, and to minimize\n\nthe potential for a chlorine leak a Risk Management Program has been established by the City of\n\nEdgewater Wastewater Treatment P"

The City of Edgewater Wastewater Treatment Facility\n\nhas never had an accidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide release with offsite consequences and in\n\nfact, they are in the wastewater treatment business.\n\n\n\nThe absolute worst case scenario as defined by EPA is for the contents of the chlorine container\n\nor a sulfur dioxide container to be released over a 10 minute period.  A faster or slower release\n\ntime will likely result in a smaller chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide plume.  For the worst case\n\nscenario, the wind is nearly calm, the release occurs at night, the atmosphere is extremely stable,\n\nand no actions are taken to stop the leak.  The maximum distance this plume could reach and still\n\ncause possible long term physical damage to a person who does not evacuate is 3 miles for\n\nchlorine and 3.1 miles for sulfide dioxide.   An alternative worst case scenario was also analyzed\n\nby the EPA, using more typical release rates, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric stability. \n\nThis results in a chlorine plume with an endpoint of 0.6 miles or a sulfur dioxide plume with an\n\nendpoint of 0.4 miles assuming no actions are taken to stop the leak.  For planning purposes, all\n\nresidents within 0.6 miles from the chemical source in the direction of the wind will be notified\n\nimmediately with emergency instructions in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release of\n\nchlorine or sulfur dioxide gas.   \n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published 40 CFR, 68, Risk Management Planning\n\n  Accidental Release Prevention Regulations, in June 1996 to implement Section 112 (r)(7) of\n\nthe Clean Air Act.  Risk Management Plans (RMPs) are required by organizations that exceed a\n\nthreshold amount of a regulated hazardous chemical to help prevent accidents, operate safely,\n\nand to manage the chemicals safely.
