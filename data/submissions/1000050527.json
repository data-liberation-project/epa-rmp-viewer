      "SummaryText": "a. The City of Pembroke Pines Water Utilities Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The City of Pembroke Pines Utilities Department is included in the Emergency Response Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The emergency response policy includes this plan, and procedures for evaluating and mitigating minor on-site releases.  The response policy is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nb. The City of Pembroke Pines Water Treatment Plant includes a chlorination system, which serves to disinfect the water supply for the City of Pembroke Pines.  The system delivers chlorine from one-ton liquid chlorine containers through two vacuum-type chlorinators.  The vacuum-type chlorinators have a built-in automatic system shut-down in the event of a vacuum pipe leak, thereby minimizing the amount of chlorine released to the atmosphere.  The first chlorinator is attached directly to the one ton container.  The second chlorinator if feed from a manifold of five one-ton containers. The chlorination system is housed in a chlorination room and an instrument room, and includes a flow recorder, electrical panels, and safety equipment.  A total of fifteen, one-ton containers of chlorine may be on-site at any one time; however, only five, one-ton containers are on-line at any one time.  A utility shift supervisor and an operator typically are responsible for all plant operations. The facility is staffed 24 hours per day 365 days per year.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n\u00b7High level of training of the operators\r\n\u00b7Preventive maintenance program\r\n\u00b7Use of state-of-the art process and safety equipment\r\n\u00b7Use of accurate and effective operating procedure"

No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\ne. The facility is included in the Emergency Response Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), as prepared for the South Florida Regional Planning Council.\r\n\r\nf. Changes to improve safety have been recommended as a result of the hazard review, conducted as part of this RMP.  These changes are currently being evaluated."
