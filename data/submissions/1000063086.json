      "SummaryText": "14535 LDEQ Facility ID Number\r\n\r\nThe Mexichem Fluor Inc. St. Gabriel facility is located on approximately 83 acres one mile south of St. Gabriel, on Louisiana Highway 75.  The facility manufactures the refrigerant gas 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a).  The facility has been in operation since December 1992 and currently employes 94 people (including contract workers).  Although KLEA 134a is the primary product, the facility also produces hydrochloric acid as a process by-product.\r\n\r\nKLEA 134a is the ozone friendly replacement refrigerant for CFC12.  It is used in automotive air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, appliances (both home and commercial), and has many other consumer uses.  It is also purified to a medical-grade for use as a propellant in inhalers.\r\n\r\nUnder EPA's RMP rule, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a) is not regulated.  However, hydrogen fluoride (a raw material used in the process) and hydrochloric acid (a process by-product) are both regulated under the rule.  Flammable chemicals are not present at the facility in quantities regulated under the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThis RMP involves predictive filing for hydrochloric acid.  The facility produces 36% nominal strength hydrochloric acid.  However, it has the capability to produce hydrochloric acid at strengths up to 38%.  Since the threshold concentration for hydrochloric acid in the RMP rule is 37% and the facility is capable of producing acid at strengths up to 38%, the predictive filing option is used for 38% hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of hydrogen fluoride and hydrochloric acid (conc. 37% or greater) provided in Section 1.17.c.3 include not only the maximum intended quantities found in the manufacturing process, but also the maximum intended quantities found in railcars located on-site.  Only a small fraction of that shown is in the manufacturing process and of that a significant fraction is in storage (i.e., the bulk of the quantities provided are in storage either in storage tanks"

Employee participation programs provide employees significant opportunities for input.  Internal reviews and audits provide a means of self-check and identify areas for improvement.  Learnings from incidents and incident investigations are shared with all employees as a means of safety improvement.  Actions to prevent a recurrence of an incident are tracked to insure timely completion.  Our improvement process allows all employees to contribute to the successful operation of the facility.  The facility is constantly striving for the highest standards in safe and environmentally sound operation.\r\n\r\nThe Mexichem Fluor Inc.
