      "SummaryText": "Indiana Steel & Wire Acquisitions Company, LTD (IS&W) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Durrel Corporation (Durrel).  Corporate and facility staff are committed to safety and are continually evaluating ways to improve safety programs and reduce chemical usage.  Durrel directs each of its facilities to voluntarily work with state Occupational Safety and Health Agencies to identify and implement improvements to their safety programs.  Consistent with this corporate policy, IS&W will be voluntarily working with the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Agency (IOSHA) to improve its safety programs.\n\nFounded in 1901, IS&W is a major manufacturer of galvanized steel wire and strand products.  IS&W uses anhydrous ammonia in an exclusive, high quality zinc plating process.  Liquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to a mix tank where ammonia is dissolved in spent, aqueous zinc plating solution to restore the solution.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was modeled according to EPA guidelines and involved the catastrophic failure of the full anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  No mitigation measures were considered in the off-site consequence analysis.  It is not likely that such an event would occur.\n\nEPA requires that five alternative release scenarios be considered and the one more likely to occur should be used in an off-site consequence analysis.  The scenario more likely to occur involves the seal failure in the pump used to transfer liquid anhydrous ammonia to the mix tank.  No mitigation measures were considered in the off-site consequence analysis.  The transfer pump seal failure is infrequent and it is not likely that the scenario described in Section 3 would occur.\n\nIS&W has safely operated the anhydrous ammonia system, without incident, since the process was installed over 45 years ago.  The facility is continually working to improve the safety of this anhydrous ammonia system.  The current tank was installed in 1977 and new safety valves and improveme"
