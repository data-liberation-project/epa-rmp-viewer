Lone Star has installed a cryognic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation plant in Geismar.  \n\n\n\nLone Star's Chalmette Gas Processing Plant receives Chalmette Refining's off gas in two streams.  The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas.  These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids.  The natural gas liquids are then pumped into a transmission pipeline to Lone Star's fractionation plant in Geismar, LA.  The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns a residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  The product is stored in a 15,000 gallon product surge tank prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\n\n\nLone Star has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  The policy is supported by many programs such as compliance with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safet"

In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.

On June 25, 2014 a lightning strike ignited the facility's vent stack.  Gas in the vent stack was the result of a leaking pressure safety valve (PSV).  The leaking PSV was identified and repaired.  There was not any injuries, property or asset damage, or environmental damage associated with this event.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Chalmette Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The emergency action plan is designed to address the facility's main hazard - hazard of fires and/or explosions.  The responsibilities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response plan.  Gathering places (primary and secondary staging areas, as well as, one off-site staging area) for employees evacuated from the control room and plant area by the emergency conditions are also listed.\n\n\n\nThe action plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too large to be extinguished by a portable handheld fire extinguisher.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental releases including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification"
