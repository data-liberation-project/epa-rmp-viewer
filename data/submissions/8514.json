Ethylene Underground Storage Facility\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nCONDEA Vista's Ethylene Underground Storage Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nCONDEA Vista is committed to Responsible Care(r) voluntary initiative for safe management of chemicals.  CONDEA Vista follows the Responsible Care(r) Code of Management Practice, which is integral to the implementation of the CONDEA Vista Environmental and Health and Safety policies.  The Responsible Care(r) Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and CONDEA Vista's Community Awareness and Emergency Response policies are designed to assist emergency preparedness and to faster community right to know.\n\nCONDEA Vista's Ethylene Storage Complex, located in Sulphur, Louisiana, stores commercial grade ethylene for shipment by pipeline to various commercial users of ethylene.  The Ethylene Storage Complex does not use, store, or produce any regulated toxics in sufficient quantity so as to be covered under RMP regulations.\n\nThe only flammables used or stored in sufficient quantity at the Ethylene Underground Storage Facility  so as to be covered under RMP regulations is ethylene and propane.\n\nThe WCS (worse case scenario) associated with the release of ethylene due the catastrophic failure of the main 6 inch line feeding into the Ethylene Storage Salt Dome The results of the failure for the main 6 inch line is the release of 27,523 pounds of ethylene. The released ethylene is assumed to vaporize and ignite res"

The look up tables published by USEPA were used to determine the maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint of .23 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Ethylene Storage Complex is the release of 10,000 pounds of ethylene due to the failure of a 1.0 inch nozzle.  The failure of this nozzle would result in the release of 10,000 pounds of ethylene over a 10 minute time period.  The 8 minute time period represents the time required to block in, isolate, and empty the process line, thus stopping the leak.\n\nThe release is assumed to result in a VCE.  The distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS scenario is 268.7 feet (.05 miles).\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ethylene Storage Complex maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the complex.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals and paper files located at the Ethylene Storage Complex.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that address known concerns and known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals. The complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The complex ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\nThe Storage Complex"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not comprised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Ethylene Storage Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the handling of ethylene are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Storage Complex primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the Storage Complex for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA f"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures.  These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed.  At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures:  (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n* Steps for safely conducting activities\n* Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n* Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n\nStorage Complex personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Ethylene Storage Complex trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive six weeks of comprehensive training before ever being assigned to the  operating unit.  This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process,  detailed review of complex procedures, such as, safe work practices and emergency response.  Oral reviews, hazardous demonstrations, and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to the unit.  Once a new employee reports to the unit,  he receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures.  Once the new hire has demonstrated,"

      "SummaryText": "through oral review and written tests, mastery of process specific operating procedures and for specific tasks, he is allowed to begin work in the unit.\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the complex, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the complex and, (3) a detailed review of the complex operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the complex.  The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.  Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Management of Change program for the Storage Complex evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of change program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSRs)\n\nThe Ethylene Storage Complex conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed in service.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure the safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the constructio"
