Parts of the operations at this facility involve the storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and are subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions located in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (i.e., 40 CFR 68).\n\nCRC is strongly committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, CRC maintains an operational policy that requires compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Significant resources have been used to implement a Process Safety Management program that is compliant with 29 CFR 1910.119.  CRC's Process Safety Management program addresses process safety, hazard analysis, management of change, mechanical integrity, operating procedures, emergency response, and employee training and meets a portion of the requirements of the Risk Management Program mandated by 40 CFR 68.\n\nStorage tanks TK-2001A/B store up to 298,729 pounds of LPG combined.  CRC conducted a process hazard analysis for the LPG production and storage system under its Process Safety Management program.  In addition, this storage tank meets the criteria for being classified as a Program Three process under 40 CFR 68.  CRC has prepared the attached Risk Management Plan to address specific actions taken in accordance with Subpart G of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nCRC has implemented over-fill controls on storage tanks TK-2001A/B to prevent accidental releases that might result from over-filling this storage tank.  In addition, the LPG storage tanks are monitored daily by both the senior operator and supervisory staff.  The LPG storage tanks have a height of 10 feet, 10.25 inches.  CRC has implemented an administrative "

      "SummaryText": "control that effectively limits the liquid height of LPG in Tanks 2001A/B to eighty percent.  A high-level alarm activates when the liquid height reaches eighty percent.  A high-high level alarm activates at ninety percent.  Both of these alarms are monitored on the pipeline control panel inside the control room. The parameters on the new tanks are set to alarm at tank level percentages instead of height. The product from these tanks is normally transferred offsite to CRC's LPG customer via an existing pipeline.  In the event of any emergencies which would shut down the pipeline, the LPG customer is contacted for immediate pickup; which usually occurs within two hours.  In the event the LPG liquid heights were to accidentally reach ninety percent, the operator would manually route the LPG production to one of the crude oil tanks.\n\nCRC's Emergency Response Plan meets or exceeds the requirements as set forth in 40 CFR 68.95 (Risk Management Rule, Subpart E - Emergency Response), 29 CFR 1910.119(n) (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) and 29 CFR 1910.38(a) (OSHA's Emergency Action Plans Regulation).  The primary objective of the Emergency Response Plan is to address what action CRC employees should take in the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The Emergency Response Plan contains emergency notification procedures and telephone numbers for the local fire district and other agency contacts (e.g., Calcasieu LEPC).  As part of its Risk Management Program, CRC has implemented an automatic calling service that notifies potentially affected neighbors if an emergency upset has the potential to cause an off-site impact.\n  \n1.2    Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions consider two types of hazards: acute toxicity from inhalation and the effects from fires and explosions.  Owners or operators of stationary sources may be subject to the Risk Management rule if they conduct an activity that i"

The original RS listing rule was promulgated on January 31, 1994 (see 59 FR 4478) and was modified by two subsequent Federal Register notices (see 62 FR 45132 and 63 FR 640).  The current list rule includes 77 toxic and 63 flammable RSs.\n\nCRC operates a petroleum refinery consisting of an atmospheric distillation unit, supporting utility units (e.g. wastewater treatment), a products pipeline, and various transfer operations (e.g., loading of naphtha product to barges).  The facility operates 24 hours a day and may process up to 85,000 barrels per day of crude oil.  The CRC facility meets the definition of stationary source as contained in 40 CFR 68.3.\n\nThe first step in determining if the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions are applicable is to determine the quantity of RSs used, stored, or produced in any processes.  If the amount of RS exceeds the threshold quantity provided for that RS, then that process is subject to the applicable provisions of the rule.  The CRC facility is a petroleum refinery and uses sweet and sour crude oil as a raw material.  The raw crude oil is unloaded from trailer trucks or barges and pumped to crude oil storage tanks for storage prior to processing.  Processing the crude oil consists of pumping the crude oil from the storage tanks to the desalters, heating it in process heaters, and then charging the heated crude oil to the atmospheric distillation column.  During distillation, various fractions of hydrocarbon product are created by separating the components of the crude oil by boiling point.  The various fractions of hydrocarbon product are then treated in downstream units.  After treatment, the products (i.e., LPG, naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and reduced crude) are routed to storage tanks for storage prior to shipment.  Shipment may be by trailer truck, product pipeline, or barge.\n\nBased on a thorough review of the "

      "SummaryText": "CRC facility there is only one affected process with a RS present above its threshold quantity.  This process is the storage of LPG in storage tanks TK-2001A/B.  LPG is a mixture of various hydrocarbon compounds including propane, butane, and pentane.  The entire LPG mixture is considered to be a RS because it has a NFPA flammability hazard rating of four (4).  The LPG contains the following listed RSs: methane (0.2 weight percent), ethane (1.6 weight percent), propane (11.98 weight percent), isobutane (9.5 weight percent), normal butane (22.0 weight percent), isopentane (20.5 weight percent), normal pentane (19.3 weight percent), heavy hydrocarbons (15.1 weight percent).  Accounting for administrative controls, up to 298,729 pounds of LPG may be stored in storage tanks TK-2001A/B.\n\nThe CRC facility does not have any processes that contain toxic RSs in amounts or conditions that warrant review under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  For example, hydrogen sulfide (CAS number 7783-06-4) is present in the crude oil in concentrations less than one percent by weight of the mixture.  Therefore, under the mixture rule, the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the mixture is not subject to the review.  Other flammable mixtures present in the facility have an NFPA flammability rating of three or less and are; therefore, exempt under the mixture rule.  For example, naphtha has an NFPA rating of three (3), kerosene has an NFPA rating of two (2), diesel has an NFPA rating of two (2), and reduced crude has an NFPA rating of one (1).\n\n1.3    Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require that the consequences from a worst-case release be estimated separately for toxic and flammable RSs.  The CRC facility does not have any process with a toxic RS in excess of a threshold quantity.  However, it does have one process with flammable RSs in excess of their associated threshold quantities.  The LPG mixture includes methane (0.2 "

Accounting for administrative controls, up to 298,729 pounds of LPG may be stored in storage tanks TK-2001A/B.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis for the CRC facility was conducted using the methodology provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in the RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document and RMPComp32.  The worst-case release scenario for flammable RSs at the CRC facility involves the sudden release of 298,729 pounds of LPG.  For modeling purposes, the worst-case analysis was conducted assuming all of the LPG was propane.  Propane is a major component of the LPG mixture and has the highest heat of combustion of all the RSs in the LPG.\n\nAdministrative controls that limit the height of the liquid in storage tanks TK-2001A/B were taken into consideration during the off-site consequence analysis.  The amount of LPG released during the worst-case release scenario assumes storage tanks TK-2001A/B has an eighty percent LPG level in each tank.  It is assumed the total quantity of the LPG mixture (i.e., 298,729 lbs.) is released during a ten-minute period, forms an explosive vapor cloud, and ignites in a vapor cloud explosion. Calcasieu Refining has taken a proactive approach to its safety of its employees, neighbors and the environment by making no change to the hazard zone. The LPG contents within both tanks have decreased with the  of the tanks. \n\nRMP*Comp was used to determine the distance to the flammable endpoint of one psig overpressure was estimated to be 0.6 miles.  The hazard zone for the flammable worst-case release scenario is a circle with its center on top of storage tanks TK-2001A/B and a radius of 0.6 miles.\n\nPotentially affected environmental receptors within"

The hazard zone for the worst-case release scenario does include a large water area (i.e., Calcasieu River).  Based on a reconnaissance of the local area there are about 9 residences within the hazard zone.\n\nThe local reconnaissance also demonstrated that there are no institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, prisons), parks, or environmental receptors  within the hazard zone.  In addition, there are no major commercial or office buildings within the hazard zone.  The hazard zone does include a recreational area (i.e., a portion of the Calcasieu River).\n\nWorst-case release scenarios have, by definition, an extremely small probability of occurrence and may be of little practical interest in terms of risk management or emergency response planning.  CRC has developed an alternative-case release scenario for storage tanks TK-2001A/B to provide a more reasonable scenario for emergency response planning.  The alternative-case release scenario involves a trailer truck loading LPG and pulling away without the loading hose being disconnected.  This results in a burst hose and the release of all the LPG in the line.  The loading hose is four-inches in diameter and 25 feet long and is estimated to hold 75 pounds of LPG.  The excess flow valve in the fill line is assumed to shut the flow of liquid from the storage tank after the truck pulls away.  In addition, it is assumed the other active mitigation measures (e.g., deluge system) will limit the LPG release to 75 pounds.\n\nIt was assumed that the released LPG formed a vapor cloud and detonated.  Modeling using the USEPA's RMP*Comp calculated the distance to the flammable endpoint of one psig overpressure is 0.02 miles.  The hazard zone for the alternative-case release scenario does extend off the facility property line.  There are no residences or institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, prisons), parks, or environmental rece"

The hazard zone does include a recreational area (i.e., a small portion of the Calcasieu River) on the south side of the facility consisting of river traffic.\n\n1.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCRC is strongly committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, CRC maintains an operational policy that requires compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  CRC has retained C-K Associates, LLC (C-K),to review its petroleum refinery to ensure it is compliance with the applicable provisions of the USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, which are codified at 40 CFR 68.  Based on this review, CRC believes its accidental release program meets the requirements of OSHA's PSM and also complies with the Risk Management rule.  Specific reviews have been conducted on the LPG storage system and, where prudent, additional controls or procedures have been implemented to reduce or minimize the consequences of any accidental release.\n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nFor the five years prior to the submittal of this RMP update there have been no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant on-site property damage.  Furthermore, there have been no accidental releases that caused known off-site deaths or injuries, required local residents to evacuate or shelter-in-place, caused property damage, or damaged the environment.\n\nCRC has an excellent record of safe operations and has been recognized by the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association (NPRA).  CRC received the Gold Award for achieving a 100 percent reduction in the total recordable incident rate during 1998 as compared to the average total recordable incident rate for the three previous calendar years.  In addition, CRC received the Award for Safety Achievement for operating thre"

The company also received the Award for Meritorious Safety performance for achieving a total recordable incidence rate of 0.0 for calendar year 1998.\n\nIn addition, the Calcasieu Refinery, in 2008, received the Meritorious Safety Performance Award.  This award recognizes facilities which have achieved a total recordable incidence rate of 1.0 or less with no workplace-related fatality of an employee or non-employee during the calendar year.\n\n\n\n1.6    Emergency Response Program\n\nCRC has a written emergency response plan that addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The plan is protective of human health and the environment and includes the following elements:\n\nA?A<    an evaluation of plant risk,\nA?A<    an evaluation of area risk,\nA?A<    notification procedures and an explanation of the communication systems,\nA?A<    a listing of emergency equipment and facilities,\nA?A<    a description of emergency response training and drills,\nA?A<    a listing of Emergency Coordinators,\nA?A<    an equipment testing program,\nA?A<    emergency response procedures,\nA?A<    procedures for returning to normal procedures, and\nA?A<    a method for documenting updates to the plan and results of drills and tests.\n\nCRC's emergency response plan meets or exceeds the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.95 (Risk Management Rule, Subpart E - Emergency Response) and 29 CFR 1910.119(n) (OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).  CRC has coordinated its emergency response program with the local fire department and will promptly provide to the Calcasieu Parish LEPC any information needed to implement the community emergency response plan.\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of CRC's Process Safety Management program.  Actions taken under this program have already improved the safety of the LPG storage process.  To further improve safety, CRC has implemented an"
