If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in nurse tanks from our bulk storage area and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmer.  The maximum  quantity stored in this area would be 117,000 pounds in our 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a nurse tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 4,300 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.8 mile.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from tampering.  The distance to the endpoint is apprximately 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damdfage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  EMERENCY RESPONSE POGRAM.  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8. "
