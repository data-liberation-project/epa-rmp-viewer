      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nManagement and employees of Central Farm Service, Clarks Grove South, MN location (hereinafter CFS), are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the onsite contractor manufacturing the liquid fertilizer, the local fire department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\nCFS periodically retains two OUTSIDE contractors who utilize a mobile unit and manufacture ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer (e.g. 10-34-0). CFS is neither involved in the manufacturing/conversion process, nor does CFS own the involved equipment. Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water. The anhydrous ammonia used in the conversion process is brought onto the facility in a semi transport/semi-tanker, or railcar. The anhydrous ammonia is on site temporarily during the conversion process:  this facility has no permanent storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Rather, it is transferred from the semi-tanker or railcar directly to the contractor's process equipment where the manufacturing process takes place immediately.  Therefore, this RMP is filed as a Predictive Filing and CFS is covered under RMP Level 2.  When the contractor's portable conversion equipment arrives on site, the CFS site RMP Level 2 is meshed with the contractor's PSM Program Level 3 to satisfy regulatory requirements during the manufacturing/conversion process. \n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture Administrative Rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling"

Both contractors have provided CFS with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program and written operating procedures are in place, along with safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the covered process.  \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History: \n \nThere have been no accidental releases of anyhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have to our knowledge:\n\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nCFS has:\na. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and a emergency response program in accordance with 40 CFR 68.95.  An emergency action plan and NH3 emergency response program training is performed annually.  Additional emergency training is also provided throughout the year at various training sessions, including but not limited to training held every fall on anhydrous ammonia. In the event of an accidental release during the conversion process, CFS employees are trained to call 911; and follow all established evacuation and emergency procedures set forth in their EAP and IRP as well as follow all contractor emergency procedures.  \n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nd. A Safety Data Sheet for anhydrous ammonia as part of their emergency response plan information for quick access and reference. \n\ne. A Minnesota AWAIR (A Workplace Accident and Injury Reduction) program in place and is committed to a safe working environment as well as protection of the"

Their portable or mobile mix units carry multiple operating documents to ensure safe operation of their reactor, as well as Emergency Action Plans and/or Field Emergency Procedure/Plans.  \n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  CFS is continuing to work with the conversion companies to ensure all safety and compliance measures as required are taken prior to beginning the conversion process."
