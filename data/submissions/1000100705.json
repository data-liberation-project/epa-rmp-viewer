General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nChemicals Incorporated has made accident prevention the number one priority at the facility, and\r\nAccidental chemical release prevention is a major facet of the accident prevention activities at Chemicals\r\nIncorporated. Key to the prevention program is comprehensive training of both operations and maintenance\r\npersonnel.\r\n5. Five Year Accident History Summary:\r\nNo Accidents involving Trimethylamine, Hydrochloric Acid, and Formaldehyde solution.\r\n6. Emergency Response Program:\r\nChemicals Incorporated's Emergency Response Program is tailored to the varied processes inherent\r\nto a small specialty chemical toll manufacturer. The plan rests on response trained operators and a 24 hour a\r\nday emergency coordinator along with two alternate coordinators to handle notifications and request for\r\nresponse from outside agencies such as LEPC-Chambers County, MAMB, Mont Belvieu Fire\r\nDepartment, and ambulance services.\r\nSpecial equipment and personal protective gear is on hand for containing releases. Training of\r\nemployees is conducted to repair any possible leaking tanks/containers. Additionally, the facility has a 1.2 million\r\ngallon fire water reservoir and associated equipment for fire-fighting service.\r\n7.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThis facility is regulated under 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency\r\nResponse and\r\n29 CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans. Chemicals Incorporated\r\nFully complies with these regulations with employee training and written plans. Additionally, the facility is a\r\nmember of Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu, the local emergency response group.\r\n\r\n2. Source and Substances Handled\r\nPrimary Activities: Specialty Chemical Toll Manufacturer\r\nUse of Substances:\r\nHydrochloric Acid (toxic): 55,000 lbs (max) bulk storage tank (8,000 gallons) - 2 Nos.\r\nTrimethylamine 19.5% solution (flammable): Total of 52,800 lbs 19.5% solution (appox. 10296 lbs of TMA) stored in in 14 totes and 72 drums. Max in a tote is 2062 lbs solution, which is approx. 40.2 lbs TMA.\r\nFormaldehyde solution -37% (Formalin) (toxic): One bulk storage tank of 6,338 gal. \r\n\r\n3. Consequence Analysis\r\n a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario:\r\n(I) Hydrochloric acid: Failure of a 4,000 gallon tank (80% full) of Hydrochloric Acid (37%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 174 minute period inside a diked (secondary containment) area of 11721 sq.ft and dike height of 1.5 ft. The 31,750 pounds (approx.) would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 2.7 miles.\r\n(II) Formaldehyde solution: Failure of a 6,355 gallon tank of Formaldehyde solution (37%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of 42,000 pounds of contents. The 42,000 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.8 miles.\r\n\r\n b. Toxic Alternative Scenario:\r\n(I) Hydrochloric acid: Hole/rupture (1 inch dia = 0.785 sq.inch) in 4000 gallon tank of Hydrochloric Acid (31%) with no emergency response resulting in the release of contents over a 30 minute period. The 21,200 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.2"
