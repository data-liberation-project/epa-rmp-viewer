The glycol is regenerated and used again in a continuous closed loop system.\r\n\r\nThe Platte Valley Plant which is contiguous to the Ft. Lupton Compressor station and makes up part of the complex is designed to process 90 mmscf/d of natural gas and recover natural gas liquids from that gas using a cryogenic process.  After processing, the gas, which consists primarily of methane, is sold to two outlet pipelines that cross the plant boundary.  The natural gas liquids are treated to remove any CO2 and then either sold down a liquids pipeline or fractionated into separate components and stored in pressurized storage before being sold into trucks as propane, butane and/or gasoline.  \r\n\r\nThe third plant that makes up the complex is the Lancaster plant which is located just east of the Ft. Lupton plant.  This plant is a cryogenic plant which recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) from the raw field gas that enters the plant at high pressure.  These liquids are sold down a liquids pipeline.  There is no NGL storage associated with Lancaster.  All natural gas is sold to the two pipelines that pass by the plant.\r\n\r\nThe total storage capacity between the three facilities exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold for these components and therefore the complex is subject to the requirements in the EPA Risk Management plan.  \r\n\r\nHistory and Ownership\r\n\r\nThe Fort Lupton Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1970's.  HS Resources purchased the facilities from Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in December of 1999.  KN Energy operated the system from April 1993 through December 1, 1999. Kerr McGee (KMG) acquired HS Resources in August, 2001. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation acquired Kerr McGee in the fall of 2006. The additional compressors were installed in the early 2000s by HS Reso"

The Lancaster plant was built by Anadarko Petroleum and commissioned in 2014.  Together these three form the Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster Complex.\r\n\r\nProgram Level\r\n\r\nAPC has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster Complex.  The Off Site Consequence Analysis reveals that there are no public receptors within the calculated 0.5 mile 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint for the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Complex has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.  There are a minimum of four employees at the facility that have completed the HAZWOPER Incident Commander training and all operators have been trained to the First Responder level of HAZWOPER.  The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes. The complex hosted a LEPC meeting on Oct. 24, 2013.  During this meeting, the emergency response plan was presented and discussed along with a site tour.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees through an observation program and regularly scheduled safety meetings.  A significant portion of each of these meetings is used to solicit ideas on how to improve safety at the complex.  There are mandatory topics that are discussed each year including those that focus on handling flammable substances, emergency response and proper operation and hazard assessment.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through APC's Observation a"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster Complex\r\nMay 2011\r\n\r\n\r\nThis executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster complex. The complex is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention and training.   This complex has an extensive operator and maintenance training program which has resulted in skilled operators who know the process, equipment and roles and responsibilities in day to day operations as well as emergency operations.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, APC will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan at this complex includes:\r\n1.  A hazard assessment to determine the types of hazards that exist at the facilities and the potential consequences of an accidental release.  \r\n2.  Development of prevention programs to allow safe operation of the equipment, this includes operational procedures, training and preventative maintenance of all equipment associated with the processes.\r\n3.  Development of an emergency response plan to help properly trained operations personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from the covered processes.\r\n\r\nLocation and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Complex is located in Weld County about three (3) miles east of Highway 85 on WCR 22 and consists of the Fort Lupton compressor st"

This complex is located in a rural area which is used primarily for farming. \r\n\r\nThe Complex consists of the Ft. Lupton gas plant, which is made up of two compression systems (high and low) and a refrigeration recovery plant.  There are 6 high pressure units with discharge pressure not to exceed 1,220 psig.  The high pressure throughput is 120 MMCF/D.  The high pressure discharge flows through glycol dehydration and is discharged to delivery points via 12 and 20 cleanable pipelines.\r\n\r\nThe low pressure system consists of 3 units whose discharge pressure of the low pressure system does not exceed 280 psig.  The low pressure throughput is 80 MMCF/D.  Gas is discharged via the 24 cleanable pipeline to the high pressure compressor at the station for recompression.  The station is equipped with liquid separation.  Liquids flow to five 225 barrel product storage tanks.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of  this portion of the complex is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission.  Each compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant. Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that should be removed.  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\r\n\r\nThe gas is then compressed which causes some of the heavy hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw, natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into either a tank tr"
