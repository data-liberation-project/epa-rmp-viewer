Although PCS Clinton has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to react to their consequences, including deployment of the on-site Emergency Response Team, no administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\n3.2 Alternate Case Scenario - Anhydrous Ammonia: \n\nA more realistic scenario would be the loss of electricity to the ammonia refrigeration system servicing the ammonia storage tanks. The tanks are actually like large insulated Thermosd bottles. The result over a period of weeks would be a slow boil-off and controlled venting of ammonia vapors. On a summer day, assuming an ambient temperature of 1000F, the 20,000-ton ammonia tank would lose product at a rate of 11.3 pounds per hour.  The 30,000-ton tank would slowly lose ammonia at a rate of 19.9 pounds per hour. For this scenario, it was conservatively estimated that the power outage would last for one full week. (Such an extensive outage has never occurred.)  The distance to the endpoint using EPA's RMP*Comp is 0.1 mile, which is the approximate distance from the tank to the PCS Nitrogen north side fence line.  \n\n3.3 Worst Case Scenario - Ammonia 29% Solution in Water: \n\nThe worst case scenario would be the total loss within 10 minutes of all ammonia and water solution from the two co-located storage tanks.

It is part of the genetic blueprints RNA and DNA, and needed by all plants and animals for proper nutrition and maturation.\n\n 1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPCS Nitrogen Clinton is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, our community and the environment.  As part of this commitment, PCS Nitrogen Clinton has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Clinton Plant.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).

PCS Nitrogen Clinton provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts with area industry and the local emergency response agencies.  The company maintains a well-trained, professionally equipped Emergency Response team made up of employee volunteers.

In addition, PCS Nitrogen works with the area industry, the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage.  Response activities have been discussed with the Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Gateway Industrial Mutual Aid Council.\n\n 1.4 Community Participation\nThe Clinton plant actively participates in and is committed to its Citizens Advisory Panel.

The RMP rule requires that the off-site consequences of an EPA-defined worst case scenario (WCS) and a more feasible alternative release scenario (ARS) be developed.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative case scenarios, PCS Clinton utilized the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.06 software program and SLAB (an EPA-approved air dispersion mathematical model).  As recommended by the EPA, the U.S. Bureau of Census' Landview program was used to estimate the number of people living within proximity to the PCS Clinton plant.  U.S. Geological Survey maps were used to identify the public and environmental receptors located near the plant.\n\n3.1 Worst Case Scenario - Anhydrous Ammonia: \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) with toxic substances under RMP Level 3 Program would be the simultaneous and instantaneous loss of all the anhydrous ammonia stored in the two on-site storage tanks.  These two interconnected tanks have capacities of 30,000 tons and 20,000 tons respectively.  Under this extremely unlikely scenario, it would be necessary for all trained employees to fail to respond to the emergency and do nothing, all operational standards would have to be violated, and all safety systems and back up systems would have to simultaneously fail or be overwhelmed. The result would be that all the liquid ammonia would pour out into the 256,000 square-foot, 12-foot high containment area.  The ammonia would form a shallow pool that would begin to evaporat"
