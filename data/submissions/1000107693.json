      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nHuntsman Advanced Materials Americas LLC (Huntsman) owns and operates the specialty chemical manufacturing facility in Ashtabula, Ohio. This facility is located at 725 State Road in Ashtabula Township. At this facility, Huntsman manufactures a variety of specialty organic chemicals. The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs approximately 55 full-time employees.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (\u00a7 68.155(a)):\n\nIt is Huntsman policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, as well as industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, Huntsman has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Ashtabula Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Ashtabula Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n*A hazard assessment to help understand: (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n*A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n*An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further descr"

      "SummaryText": "ibing these elements is provided below.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Ashtabula Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program. In fact, the Ashtabula Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental management program in place that complies with ISO 14001 and 45001, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as preventing injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nHuntsman's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Ashtabula Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, Huntsman reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and/or Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for new installations, as well as modifications of existing processes that handle hazardous materials.\n\nHuntsman strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: Huntsman implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment. Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, Huntsman requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.

Huntsman utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Huntsman trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, Huntsman works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Huntsman has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Ashtabula County, Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (AC-CAER).\n\nAshtabula Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Ohio and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Ashtabula Plant. If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Ashtabula County-CAER Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\nHuntsman is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness. In addition, the Ashtabula Plant demonstrates community commitment by providing involvement and leadership in important local organizations such as the local Safety Council. The Ashtabula Plant was a founding member of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which was formed in 1994. Safety is a primary concern in our facility and throughout our organization.\n\n2.

It is stored as a liquid in a 24,000-gallon storage tank and is pumped to the process through stainless steel piping.\n\nHydrogen sulfide is used as a raw material. It is stored as a liquefied gas in a railroad tankcar and flows to the process through carbon steel piping.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (\u00a7 68.155(c)):\n\nThe Ashtabula Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario.\" However, Huntsman does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nALOHA 5.4.7 and MARPLOT were used for evaluating the endpoint distances for the worst-case scenarios and the alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst cases and average meteorological values for the alternative release scenarios. The MARPLOT program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within endpoint distance from the storage location and to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance. The plots are included as jpeg files in the scenarios submitted.\n\n4. The General Accidental Re"

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant; (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant; and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant. Huntsman ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees.\n\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes. The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n* Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n* Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n* Reactivity and corrosivity data\n* Thermal and chemical stability data\n* Hazards of mixing substances in the process\n\nSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Product Manual (see below).

A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process. The plant primarily uses the \"HAZOP\" technique to perform this analysis. The PHA results, including a list of recommendations, are documented within the site's Integrated Management System (IMS), EHS Insight.  Recommendations are implemented via assignment of a CAPA (Corrective Action/Preventive Action) within EHS Insight, which allows tracking to completion.\n\n4.1.3 Operating Procedures\nAshtabula Plant process engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.

Operating procedures include:\n* Steps for safely conducting activities\n* Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n* Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, and process upset. The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the plant's processes and as a training guide. In addition, the Ashtabula plant utilizes instruction logbooks to communicate on a daily basis. These logbooks provide an opportunity to emphasize key points and request specific tasks.\n\n4.1.4 Training\nThe Ashtabula Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\n\n4.1.5 Mechanical Integrity\nThe Ashtabula Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment. The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant's processes.

The audit team includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM rule and in applicable safety and environmental regulations as well as the processing details. The results of the audit are documented in the IMS (EHSI), with recommendations captured as actions which are tracked to completion to ensure enhancements to the prevention program are implemented as appropriate.  The audit of the facility programs, safety and environmental processes, and documentation is conducted at three-year intervals.\n\n4.1.9 Incident Investigation\nThe Ashtabula Plant investigates incidents, including near misses that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. The plant trains its employees to identify and report incidents. The investigation process consists of multiple levels of investigation which are dependent on the severity or outcome of the incident. If necessary, a team of personnel is assembled to perform the investigation.  The results of the investigation are documented in the IMS (EHS Insight), with recommendations and appropriate process enhancements entered as actions and tracked to completion.\n\nHuntsman has a formal program including training for incident investigations.\n\n4.1.10 Employee Participation\nThe Ashtabula Plant developed a written employee participation program to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's workers are addressed. The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant.

The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  A hot work permit is required for personnel who are to perform hot work in any area of the plant containing chemical hazards. The Shift Supervisor or designated permit writer executes all the requirements of the hot work procedure before work can begin. Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant's new hire orientation.\n\n4.1.12 Contractors\nThe Ashtabula Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.
