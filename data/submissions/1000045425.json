Hubbell, MI, its management and employees are committed to the safe, responsible management of all site operations.  The safety of our employees and neighbors is of primary importance in all site work activities.  Hubbell's combined safety programs include EPA's the Risk Management Program (RMP), OSHA's Process Safety Management Program for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM), Emergency Response Program, and other supporting company policies and procedures.  These interrelated processes are created and maintained to provide a high degree of protection against the uncontrolled release of ammonia.  If there should be a release, these same systems are designed to provide sufficient warning to employees and nearby residents to mitigate catastrophic consequences.\n\n\n\nOsmose Hubbell's Risk Management Plan (RMP) meets in full the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Planning and, 29 CFR Part 1910.119, Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Hubbell's Emergency Response Plan has been submitted and approved by the State of Michigan and the Houghton County LEPC, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302.  \n\n\n\nOsmose Hubbell's Risk Management Plan applies to anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7), its storage and processing pursuant to 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 as well as the State of Michigan Air Quality Division, Air Use Permit Special Conditions.  Ammonia containing solutions having less than 20% ammonia by weight are exempt from these regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety Approach\n\n\n\nSafety is addressed throughout Osmose, Inc. using cross-functional teams to continually assess and advise on its current programs and continually evaluate the need for additional processes and/or procedures to maximize safety for both employees and community neighbors.

      "SummaryText": "om industry specialists to government agencies supplement internal job knowledge experts to provide necessary guidance to ensure safety management as well as compliance with applicable regulations.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nOsmose, Inc. Hubbell manufactures cupric oxide and copper carbonate, finely divided powders that are used in a variety of industrial applications, the predominate being wood preservation.  The first step in production involves dissolving metallic copper in a solution of ammonia, carbon dioxide and water.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a leaching agent.  The copper rich solutions are reacted to derive either oxide and carbonate slurries that are precipitated, and dried to resultant powdered products.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3), direct from storage, is sparged into a water solution on immediately entering the plant.  In solution, the concentration of ammonia normally ranges from 8% - 12% by volume.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received in liquid state and stored as a liquid (with vapor space) in an industry standard pressure vessel.  The Hubbell ammonia storage tank has a storage capacity of 12,000 gallons.  Consistent with industry and vessel design considerations, the tank is only filled to ~ 80% capacity or 9,600 gallons (~ 50,000 lbs.).  This industry practice allows for vapor space within the tank to attenuate ambient temperature fluctuations.  Nominal tank pressure ranges from 80 to 90 psig.  Ammonia is delivered via standard commercial truck tankers.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario        \n\n\n\nHubbell's worst case scenario to generate the greatest distance endpoint involves releasing the contents of a full ammonia storage tank within a 10-minute time period.  The maximum volume contained in the tank is 56,200 pounds.  A total release of these contents could impact a population of 2.500 people within a 3.7 mile radius of the facility.  Hubbell's Offsite Emergency Response Plan was developed jointly with the Houghton County Office of Emergency Measures, app"

Since the original site submission in 1992, Osmose Hubbell has continued to meet with local LEPC officials to provide updates.\n\n\n\nA current plan is filed with Houghton County Office of Emergency Measures, the State of Michigan, and the Hubbell Volunteer Fire Department.  Table top incident response exercises have been conducted with LEPC officials and responders.  Local responders awareness and logistic meetings, more than 40 attendees, have been conducted on site, with the most recent being Q2 of 2013.  Hubbell employees have been trained to provide information and logistical support to responder agencies.  No active support by Hubbell employees is provided at present.\n\nThe potential for a catastrophic release appears minimal.  The ammonia storage tank resides within a locked fence portion of the facility.  Additionally, the entire Hubbell facility is fenced with gated entry locks.  In addition to fencing, the storage tank is heavily guarded with pylons to prevent inadvertent damage from delivery vehicles.  Ammonia sensors are strategically located at the ammonia tank to alarm if ambient ammonia is sensed within the area.  Automatic control valves have been installed, both in the field and in the control room, to allow distant shutdown and isolation of the ammonia tank.  These valves are additional to the industry standard excess flow valves mounted on the tank.  Finally, cameras transmitting to the control room provide visual status of the storage area.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the above active protection, mechanical integrity, non-destructive testing of the ammonia tank and associated covered process piping was conducted in 2013 to verify equipment fit for service.  The entire ammonia storage facility is permitted by Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Air Quality Division.  Annual inspections are performed by State officials as well as the inspections required by Process Safety Management regulat"

In this event, vapor and liquid would be released into the immediate storage area and continue till detected.  This scenario assumes the leak would not be detected for an hour.  This alternate scenario has 6,000 pounds of ammonia (100 pounds per minute) releasing unabated.\n\n\n\nThis scenario would impact perhaps 30 local residents or employees of neighboring businesses.  The preventive measures as described above should minimize the likelihood of an uncontrolled release even for brief periods of time.    \n\n\n\nPrevention Program Elements \n\n\n\nOsmose Hubbell has instituted a comprehensive prevention program as required by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and the permit conditions in the site's State of Michigan Air Use Permit.  Airgas Specialty Products is the owner of the ammonia tank and associated equipment upstream the lines into the Hubbell plant.  However, as mentioned previously, Osmose Hubbell has taken actions at the company's expense to perform non-destructive, fit-for-service equipment inspections consistent with mechanical integrity requirements for non-fired pressure vessels and associated piping.  These equipment evaluations were conducted by a third party resource.  This in addition to Airgas conducting regular inspections of all components of the system should ensure safe reliable operation into the future.\n\n\n\nOsmose Hubbell involves employees in this program at all levels, in cross-functional teams whose responsibilities include the evaluation of internal safety processes related to ammonia storage and handling. Frequent system inspections, coupled with instrumentation data, provide current status and condition of the equipment and its operation, as well as reinforces the awareness of potential hazards asso"

Osmose Hubbell's Hazard Communication Training Program focuses heavily on safe handling of ammonia.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Report\n\n\n\nThe Osmose Hubbell site has neither observed nor recorded any incidents of accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.  \n\n\n\n Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs indicated above, Osmose Hubbell takes a defensive response posture.  Any employee who observes an unplanned release is directed to immediately shutdown and isolates the ammonia storage and associated piping systems.  As these systems have automatic control valves, this isolation securing can be accomplished through a number of distant triggering devices, including several hard-wired locations and the site distributive control system (DCS).  Additionally, employees are directed to immediately contact their supervisor via radio or, if in their judgment the release threatens the safety and health of plant employees or local residents, activate emergency response procedures.  In this latter case, the appropriate action is to activate the evacuation alarm and assemble personnel in the designated meeting location(s).  Emergency response agencies shall be notified as soon as safely possible.\n\n\n\nOsmose personnel will serve as liaison for responder agencies, providing relevant site and equipment situational information.  Osmose Emergency Response Plan and EPCRA offsite response plan are reviewed annually with updates communicated to Houghton County Office of Emergency Measures, the State of Michigan, and the Hubbell Volunteer Fire Department (VFD).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response training is accomplished annually or during new employee orientation.
