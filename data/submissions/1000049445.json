CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the central United States and Canada and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. The company also owns 50 percent interests in GrowHow UK Limited, a plant nutrient manufacturer in the United Kingdom; an ammonia facility in The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago; and KEYTRADE AG, a global plant nutrient trading organization headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland. CF Industries routinely posts investor announcements and additional information on the company's website at www.cfindustries.com and encourages those interested in the company to check there frequently. \r\n\r\nIt is the policy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment, and the health and safety of its employees.  This protection extends to neighbors of the Terminal.  Additionally, we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations and the Company will promote environmental concern and education among our employees and with the communities in which we operate.  CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees, and will take all practical steps to eliminate or reduce the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job, and encourages off-the-job employee safety and health awareness as well.

The commitment to excellence regarding Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) issues is supported in total by Senior Management of CF Industries.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nOne of the Company's distribution facilities is the Fremont Terminal, located approximately 2 miles north of Fremont.  CF Industries has been a member of the community since 1965.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the Fremont Terminal.  The Fremont Terminal receives ammonia by pipeline and rail, then distributes it into tank trucks.  The Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in one refrigerated above-ground tank in addition to one pressurized storage tank known as a bullet.  An extensive EHS program assures compliance with applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nCF Industries' anhydrous ammonia is used primarily as a fertilizer.  Ammonia is a source of nitrogen that is essential for plant growth.  It is classified by the Department of Transportation as a non-flammable, compressed gas.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nCF Industries' Layers of Protection\r\nCF Industries has implemented a comprehensive program at its distribution facilities designed to safeguard the environment, its workers and the surrounding communities.  The layers of protection are the numerous prevention mechanisms implemented at the Company's fertilizer storage facilities to help manage the risks inherent in handling anhydrous ammonia.  The key safety features are listed below.\r\n\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  The facility conducts comprehensive reviews to ensure that hazards associated with CF Industries' processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  These reviews are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  One of these reviews is a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is design"

The review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  Critical operating conditions at the Fremont Terminal are monitored through two independent sets of instrumentation.  Pressure and level gauges alert Terminal personnel with alarms and automatic shutdowns.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  A flare helps control tank pressure by burning ammonia vapor before it can be released to the atmosphere.  This is performed when the ammonia compressors are unable to maintain the tank pressure.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  The ammonia tank system is protected by pressure/vacuum relief valves and compressors which operate automatically.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  Emergency shutdown buttons are located throughout the facility.  These buttons can be used by anyone to shutdown the product flows in the event of an emergency.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  CF Industries has instituted a comprehensive tank inspection program that requires every tank be inspected at twenty year intervals.  Tanks are emptied and subjected to a series of tests.  This program is designed to identify and correct any tank problems.  A tank outage typically lasts three months and costs the Company $300,000.  Although an inspection is costly in terms of money and distribution logistics, CF Industries believes the safety benefits far outweigh the costs.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  Through CF Industries' PSM program, all covered equipment used at the facility undergoes routine performance tests and maintenance.  This PSM program forms the foundation for the RMP prevention program.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  The Fremont Terminal is staffed around-the-clock.

Any truck that fails the inspection is not permitted to remove anhydrous ammonia from the facility.\r\nA\u00bfA\u00b7  Another essential element of our Layers of Protection is employee training and continuing education.
