In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nF&M Coop's mission states \"To Provide Quality Products and Services in an Enviromentaly safe manner\". In order to fulfill this mission, we conduct at a minimum an annual inspection of our facilitiy, along with a review of our local Emergiency Response and Contingency Plan and make any changes our updates at that time.  F&M also has annual training on the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia, along with other safety practices that need to be  followed by the empoyees.  \n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soi"

      "SummaryText": "l as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia may also used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately fifteen (15) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and two (2) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 130,000 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 21,000 gallon stationary storage tank on site. The maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks 98,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.   In addition, anhydrous ammonia may be stored temporarily in one rail car. The maximum quantity anhydrous ammonia that may \nbe stored in the rail car is 160,000 pounds.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 388,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 160,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of an 80 ton rail car when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have an off-site impact. It should be noted that F&M Coop has never had a release of an entire rail car from our distribution facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a rail car representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 27,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have an off-site impact. It should be noted that F&M Coop has never had a release of this type from it's distribut"

While the worst case scenario would have an off-site impact, secondary containment (dike) around the aqua ammonia storage tank provides passive mitigation. The dike system contains the potential release close to the source thereby minimizing the total volume of ammonia that can be released. \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental d"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, F&M Coop has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for  that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n \nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
