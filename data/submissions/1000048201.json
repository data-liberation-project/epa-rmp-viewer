Elliot & Son, Stillwater Orchards complies with California Accidental Release Prevention (CAL ARP) Program requirements and RMP/PSM requirements. This rural facility in a farming area does post harvest processing of fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the local area. The facility has operated as a program 2 with 1 refrigeration system less than 10,000 lbs.. An expansion in 2011 added a new separate Cold Storage facility behind the existing packing shed and cold storage.  A PHA on the new expansion was performed in 2011 and one the existing Cold Storage 1 in 2013. NH3 inventory for the new facility is over 10,000 lbs. and under 10,000 lbs for the existing.  Both refrigeration systems meet or exceed applicable Building and Fire Codes including water filled diffusion tank on the newer facility and on-site ponding basins for any run-off. The existing Cold Storage will operate as Program 3 in 2015 as requested by the CUPA.\n\n\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations we used are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n\n2.    Determine Program Level\n\n3.    Establish a Management System\n\n4.    Conduct a 5 year Accident History\n\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nOur Program 3 RMP/PSM for the new facility has 19 Sections that correspond to RMP/PSM regulatory sections. Publication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). These sections include Overview, Registration, Management System, Accident History, Hazard Assesment, Emergency Response/Actions, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Me"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at David J. Elliot & Son, Stillwater Orchards are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass postharvest packing, cooling and storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for a refrigerant in 2 separate buildings with independent closed loop refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMPComp  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest of 2 independent systems.  This release scenario is impossible to accomplish. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by the enclosure in direct contact with outside air.  At Class F atmospheric stability, rural location and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Population estimates for the entire radius is calculated using Landview 6 & Marplot. Actual number that could be affected by the plume area is only 10% of this. Worst Case details are not included in the executive summary as required. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from either systems ammonia refrigeration system compressor.  The scenario involves the release of 300.00 lb. of .  Toxic ammonia vapor.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles. Actual distances less than .1 mile are recorded as .1 miles. No public receptors would be impacted. An onsite employee facility is all that would be impacted.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The facilities were designed and constructed in accordance with applicable building a fire codes at time of construction. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDavid J.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 10/4/2011. All possible conditions that could upset the system and natural disasters like fire, flooding and earthquake. A Hazop revalidation was performed on the older CS 1 refrigeration system in 2014.\n\n\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, David J. Elliot & Son, Stillwater Orchards maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  It also includes Confined Space Entry, NH3 Unloading, Quality Control, LOTO, Oil Draining and line Break procedures. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\n-Training\n\nDavid J.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. A few of the recommendations from the 2011 PHA include; LOTO boards in the new mechanical room, better ID of switches that would be used in an emergency to isolate zones, clearer labels on E-stop and E-start switches, additional protection barriers for NH3 equipment/piping, and missing seismic bracing on one vessel. Most of these are a result of the construction process still underway at the time of the PHA. A seismic walkdown and testing of all safety systemes was completed prior to the facility starting. Cold Storage 1 PHA recommendations include additional seismic bracing and clamps, corrosion treatment and painting.\n\n"
