FACILITY POLICY\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF THE WOLF ELEVATOR, GARDEN CITY CO-OP, INC. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AUTHORITIES TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITIES AT THE THE FACILITY ARE TO RECIEVE, STORE, AND MERCHANDIZE GRAIN AND THE STORAGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORED IN 1000 GALLON NURSE TANKS.  THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS TO BE SOLD TO FARMERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 88,000 POUNDS IN 20 INDIVIDUAL NURSE TANKS.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n     A.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF THE NURSE TANKS  RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 4,400 #, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200PPM) IS 0.54 MILES.  THERE ARE TWO HOMES WITHIN THE ENDPOINT HOUSING 10 PEOPLE.\n     B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.47 MILES. THERE IS ONE HOME WITHIN THE ENDPOINT HOUSING 5 PEOPLE IF PROPER LOW WIND AND HIGH HUMIDITY CONDITIONS EXISTED.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\" PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1919.111, \"STORAGE AND H"

THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     THIS IS A NEW NURSE TANK STORAGE FARM SINCE THE DEERFIELD ELEVATOR ANHYDROUS FACILITY HAS BEEN CLOSED.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY; NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     THE FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38, HAS PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA), AND HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.120, INCLUDING PRE-EMERGENCY PLANNING AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n     SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
