      "SummaryText": "2.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSafety at Harry's is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical\n\nintegrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to safety at our facility. Harry's has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) ?1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions\n\nof OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n2.2 Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\nHarry's refrigerates food products such as soups, entrees, deserts, and sauces. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods, and Harry's uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\n2.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHarry's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by Harry's. Training is provided to ensure that each employee invol"

      "SummaryText": "ved in operating the refrigeration system understands the refrigeration process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n2.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the Harry's facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n2.5 Emergency Planning and Response\n\nharry's has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the\n\nprovisions of Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OR-OSHA) emergency planning requirements in OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes preemergency\n\nplanning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with Portland Fire and Rescue. The approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Harry's and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, Harry's has\n\ntrained personnel to immediately notify Portland Fire and Rescue and take defensive actions to mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to\n\nminimize the potential for an uncontrolled release. All Harry's Frozen Foods personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an\n\nemergency. Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement. This plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\n2.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAny upgrades "
