      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThe Northern California Power Agency Combustion Turbine Project No. 2 is a 50 megawatt facility producing power for the local electrical grid.  Ammonia is used to control emissions from the power generation process.\n \nThe California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program combined the existing State Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP) and the new Federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) promulgated pursuant to Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  The California Office of Emergency Services (OES) oversees the CalARP regulations.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has delegated implementation authority for the Federal program to OES.  At the local level, the program is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA).  For facilities operating within the City of Lodi, the CUPA is the County of San Joaquin, Office of Emergency Services.\n\nBecause the CalARP program is a combination of the Federal and State requirements, the program includes two lists of regulated toxic and flammable substances.  While many of the chemicals are present on both lists, the state applicability thresholds are generally lower.  The Federal threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds and the State threshold quantity is 500 pounds.\n\nThe RMP must be developed from a comprehensive assessment of the processes, operations, and procedures at the facility, and includes four main elements:\n\n     A Management System that specifies qualified and responsible persons;\n     A Hazard Assessment that analyzes and documents potential environmental and population receptors due to an accidental release;\n     A Prevention Program that compiles operational procedures, safety information, and specific hazard information into a program that minimizes the threat of an accidental release; and\n     An Emergency Response Program that establishes procedures to deal with the results of an accidental release.\n\nAlso addressed in this document are re"

      "SummaryText": "quirements of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 355.  The requirements of this section apply to any facility at which an extremely hazardous chemical is present at or above the threshold planning quantity.  The threshold planning quantity is the amount of a chemical above which the facility is required to notify the local emergency planning committee or emergency response personnel of the chemicals present, to provide a facility emergency response coordinator and to notify the committee of any changes that occur.\n\nAny facility that produces, uses or stores hazardous chemicals above the threshold planning quantity is required to notify specific agencies in the event of a release.   The reportable quantity is the amount of chemical that, when released, requires notification of designated agencies.   Ammonia, a hazardous chemical located at NCPA, has a threshold planning quantity of 500 pounds.  The reportable quantity for ammonia is 100 pounds. \n\nThe format for this document is taken from the  Guidance Document for the California Consolidated Contingency Plan published by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services and is modeled after the National Response Team's Integrated Plan, the \"One Plan.\"\n"
