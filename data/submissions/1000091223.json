The purpose of this RMP document\r\nis to assist with the prevention of accidental releases of flammable substances that can cause\r\nharm to the public, facility employees and the environment.\r\nThe GDI-P&IP Aledo facility stores Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propylene, CAS No.115-07-1) for\r\nuse in pump plunger manufacturing operations exceeding Table 3: \u00a768.130 - List of Regulated\r\nFlammable Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention of 10,000\r\npounds. The facility maintains two 1,990-gallon tanks for a total potential capacity of 3,980 gallons\r\n(17,034 pounds). The propylene system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with\r\nfederal, state, and local laws.\r\nRisk is defined by the combination of the probability or likelihood that the process will experience\r\nan event and the consequences, impact, or severity of the event. Each process assumes some\r\nelement of risk, however, when risk management techniques are applied to monitor and track\r\nevents with the potential to impact operations, the overall risk can be minimized at the facility.\r\nThis facility complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements for LP-Gas\r\nstorage, and will adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency,\r\nit is our policy to notify the Fire Department and request assistance in respond to an emergency.\r\nThe worst-case scenario evaluated is failure of the storage tank system when filled to the greatest\r\namount allowed (88% at 20\u00b0C), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

The resulting\r\ndistance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the\r\nendpoint.\r\nThe facility has no reported accidents involving propylene that caused deaths, injuries, property\r\nor environmental damage, evacuations, or required sheltering in place orders.\r\nThe system is equipped with safety measures to prevent accidental release and equipment to\r\ndetect a release. In the event of an emergency involving the propylene system, it is policy to notify\r\nthe Fire Department and request assistance responding to the emergency. We will coordinate our\r\nresponse plan with the fire department and have the fire department inspect the propylene system\r\nand conducted joint exercises."
