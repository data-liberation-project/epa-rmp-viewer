      "SummaryText": "1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nMarine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Pendleton is the United States Marine Corps? largest amphibious assault training facility. MCB Camp Pendleton covers an area of approximately 125,000 acres and is populated by over 40,000 military personnel and civilian employees in addition to numerous military dependents. MCB Camp Pendleton provides its own water supply and wastewater treatment facilities within its boundaries. Disinfection is therefore necessary to reduce the potential for transmission of infectious diseases. Chlorination has long been the accepted and preferred method of disinfection for both water and wastewater in the United States. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure during handling and to protect the health of persons on MCB Camp Pendleton and in the surrounding communities.\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nPrevention of accidental releases for the MCB Camp Pendleton chlorine systems is dependent on providing chlorine handling procedures, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, and staff training. MCB Camp Pendleton facilities have been assessed against the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 55 ? Storage, Use and Handling of Compressed and Liquefied Gases in Portable Cylinders, and it is Base policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The buildings are marked ?Danger Chlorine? to reduce unauthorized entry. Each chlorine system is enclosed in a locked building and access is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.\nThe accidental release protection for the chlorine systems also involves a prevention program that includes:\n* Maintaining up-to-date safety information;\n* Conducting a process hazard analysis;\n* Implementing operating procedures;\n* Implementing a staff training program;\n* Implementing a maintenance "

      "SummaryText": "program;\n* Conducting compliance audits; and\n* Conducting incident investigations.\nAn Emergency Response Program has been developed to respond to any chlorine release scenario. Emergency response actions involve the system operators and maintenance staff, the Base Fire Department, and offsite expertise from the San Diego County Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT), when necessary. In addition, the Assistant Chief of Staff (AC/S), Environmental Security (Env Scty) or an appointed representative serves as the focal point for notifying the appropriate agencies and providing information to the public.\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nChlorine stored in 150-pound cylinders is used for disinfection at both water supply and wastewater treatment facilities under Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program Level 1. A process is eligible for Program Level 1 if the process has not had any California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP)-defined accidents in the past five years (see in Section 4.0), if the worst-case release scenario (defined in Section 5.0) does not impact any public receptors, and if emergency response efforts are coordinated with outside responding agencies. Table 1-1 identifies the Program Level 1 chlorine facilities at MCB Camp Pendleton, provides a description of the process, and lists the maximum amount of chlorine in the system. No new sites were added since the last RMP update. Facilities that have been removed from the revised RMP are listed in Table 1-2. Other chlorine facilities that exist at MCB Camp Pendleton are described in two additional RMP Public Documents ? Program Levels 2 and 3.\n\nTable 1-1.

The buildings containing the systems have been evaluated against NFPA 55 and the Uniform Building Code. As a result, several system or building upgrades are being planned or considered (see Section 1.7 for more details).\nAlthough not required by CalARP regulations, MCB Camp Pendleton has developed a prevention program that includes:\n* Documenting process safety information regarding the hazards of chlorine and components of the system;\n* Conducting a process hazard analysis to evaluate potential mechanical failures or operational causes that could result in an accidental release;\n* Implementing written operating procedures;\n* Implementing a training program;\n* Implementing a preventive maintenance program;\n* Conduc"

This is defined as ?all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage? (California Code of Regulations [CCR], Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Section 2750.9). According to information provided by the Base Fire Department AC/S, Env Scty, there have been no accidental releases from the Program Level 1 chlorine systems that meet the above definition since the original RMP was issued on 21 June 1999.\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on the existing management system (see Appendix A) for responding to emergencies, the appropriate discovery and notification procedures, and coordination with the San Diego County HIRT. The operators and maintenance staff from the Facilities Maintenance Department (FMD) have been trained as Facilities Responders to report accidental releases to the Base Fire Department. The Base Fire Department subsequently notifies HIRT for emergency response actions if needed. The AC/S, Env Scty plays an active role in notifying the appropriate government agencies and communicating releases to the public.\n\n1.7 PLANNED UPGRADES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nUpgrades to improve safety of several of the Program Level 1 chlorine systems were being considered or planned at the time of this document?s initial preparation and submittal.
