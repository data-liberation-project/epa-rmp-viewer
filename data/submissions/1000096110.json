All compliance issues have been met and/or updated per RMP and OSHA requirements.  No new hazards have been identified and there have been no catastrophic incidences during the previous 5 years.  Equipment has been maintained and records made for daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, bi-annual and annual inspections.  Any issues found were promptly corrected, however there were only regular maintenance per Manufacturers' and EPA/OSHA suggestions. \n\n\n\nThis facility is a cold storage warehouse located outside the City of Chelan, Chelan County, State of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used as a refrigerant.  There is approximately 10,140 lbs of ammonia in the facility, based on receipts for ammonia purchases.\n\n\n\nThe facility's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  It is the policy of Management to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.  The prevention plan meets all the requirements of OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration personnel do not respond to large ammonia releases and have not received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1920.120.  Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release, if possible.  If not possible, they will evacuate.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate.  The Fire Department or Hazmat Team will take control of the incident upon arrival at the plant.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.  The plan has been rev"

Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n  Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n  Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n  Reduce the threat to the community and environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has one engine room and 19 CA rooms.  The largest vessel will hold 13,299 lbs of ammonia, however it will never be filled to capacity but rather up to 80% of capacity (10,755 lbs).  During the past 5 years no ammonia has been added to the system and total ammonia is 10,140 lbs which is spread out through the entire system and never held in one vessel.  Isolation valves are located throughout the facility with remote operation and shutdown capabilities.  The engine room has an outside kill switch and ammonia detector.\n\n\n\nOther hazardous substances are used on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\nThe policies, procedures and training that have been established will reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of it's employees and surroundings. \n\n\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA and WA State process safety management rules and regulations, WA State safety regulations, and IIAR standards for good work practices.  The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems used include:\n\n\n\n  Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n  Suction trap hi-level float\n\n  High discharge pressure shut down\n\n  Low suction pressure shut down\n\n  High discharge temperature shut down\n\n  Oil pressure failure shut own\n\n  High amperes shut down\n\n  Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\n\n  Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n  "
