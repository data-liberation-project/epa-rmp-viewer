The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the facility, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of one storage tank (18,377 gallon), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility, employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3.
