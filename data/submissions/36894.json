The owner, management, and employees of Hutchinson Co-opare committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia if any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimze the impact of the release on people and the enviroment.\n2.  Facility Information\n    A.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n    B.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application on crops as fertilzier nutrient.\n    C.  The maximum quantity stored would be 132,600 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank.\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n    A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum quantity released would be 132600 pounds, which represents the volume of the tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.06 miles.\n    B.  The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.59 miles.\n4.  The accidental release, prevention plan\n    A.  The facility has implemented the provision of the safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1, published by the american national standards institute inc\n    B.  The facility has implemented the standards of the us occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n4.  The five year accident history\n    A.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that have caused any death, i"
