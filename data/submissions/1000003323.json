Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in fifteen states.  Fifteen processing facilities produce about 56 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 12 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms Georgetown Processing Facility (P-2178) is located at 20621 Savannah Road, Georgetown, Delaware. This facility is the primary source of production for roasters.  Perdue Farms purchased this facility in 1978 and started operations in January 1979.  The facility is sited on about 70 acres on the north side of town, east of the town circle, about \u00c2\u00bd mile north of Route 9.  It is bounded by some residences and farmland.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management and through 7 Delaware Code Chapter 77 (Accidental Release Prevention Regulation) where Delaware administers EPA 40 CFR Part 68 for Chemical Action Prevention Provisions.   \n\nIt is used onsite for chilling processes and refrigeration of product. The Georgetown facility has four separate ammonia systems ranging from 7,400 pounds to 30,000 pounds.  In each system, ammonia is distributed throughout the components (compressors, condensers, evaporators, etc.).  Each system has equipment both inside and outside the facility.   The total ammonia storage in all four systems onsite is 72,600 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the comp"

A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Perdue\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including any release of a hazardous material.  Key employees are trained in prevention and responses for rapid and effective action should an accident occur.\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operation facility as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\n\nPerdue Georgetown has complied with Delaware\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Regulation (formerly Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act) since its promulgation in 1989 and the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 since its inception in 1992.  Up-to-date process information such as equipment information, piping and instrument diagrams and Material Safety Data Sheets, are kept onsite.  Employee participation includes operating and maintenance procedures development, review and training.  Contractors are required to submit qualification statements of competency.  Process Hazard Analyses with recommendations have been done, and corrective actions taken. Regular mechanical integrity inspections are scheduled.  In addition, Perdue performs internal audits on its PSM processes. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no on- or off"

      "SummaryText": "-site accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at the Perdue Georgetown facility that have resulted in death, injuries, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPerdue Georgetown has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.  The facility has a trained HAZWOPER (HAZardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release or other emergency situation.  The Plan contains specific information regarding emergency response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation and incident preparedness.  Evacuation exercises are conducted, and drills are scheduled with the local emergency responders (Georgetown Volunteer Fire Department with call box backup from Milton and Lewes).  Perdue Georgetown is a member of the Sussex County Local Emergency Planning Committee and is part of the community emergency response plan.\n\nPerdue staff helped Kent County LEPC develop its second seminar covering both ammonia and propane in 2006. Perdue\u00c2\u00bfs Georgetown and Corporate personnel participated with local, county and state emergency responders in a functional exercise called Operation Sly Fox in 2006.  Perdue staff regularly attends Sussex LEPC meetings. Perdue staff attended a statewide multi-emergency response training in April 2008.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn the past five years (2004 to present), Perdue has continued to make various improvements to the ammonia refrigeration systems.  The list includes replacement of various piping and valves, coils, a valve station, suction trap and oil pot.   Major components such as a pump package, compressors, heat exchangers, a condenser, a jacketed chiller and a high-pressure receiver have been exchanged for newer equipment.   The thermosyphon oil cooling for compressors in one system was upgraded, and a new Quantum control panel was installed on one of the compressors."

Currently, planned improvements include change out of all pressure-relief valves over a five-year cycle.   Other potential improvements, based on annual inspections, audits, process hazard analyses and/or mechanical integrity inspections, include such items as replacement of condensers, valves, piping, evaporators, vacuum pumps, ice makers and/or water pumps."
