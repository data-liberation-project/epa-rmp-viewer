The Facility Policy \n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Cargill. of Monon  are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\na The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nb  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application of product nutrients to farms.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\nA. The worst case scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car used to transport the material to the facility.\n\nB.  The alternative release scenario is based on the hazard review is a two minute release from a break in a 3-inch pipe on the on-site storage tank.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K41.1, published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.1 11, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. This facility has also complied with the Ammonia Law regulated by the Office of the State Chemist.\n5. The five-year Accident History\n\n There have been no accidental releases in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\na.A w"
