ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe Town of Orange Park Ash Street Facility accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n1.1.1. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (A)(1)\n The Town of Orange Park has a management system in place, which oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other Town of Orange Park policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1.2. PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (A)(2)\n The Town of Orange Park maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3 listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained by the Town of Orange Park's Public Works Director, at the Ash Street Faciltiy..\n1.2. THE TOWN OF ORANGE PARK STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT ASH STREET FACILITY (B)\nThe Town of Orange Park Plant employs 12 full-time employees engaged in water and wastewater treatment plant and field operations.  Only 6 employees including the Public Works Director and Utilities Superintendent are permitted in the chlorine building. Chlorine is used as part of the manufacturing process.\n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION  (B)(1)\n The site is owned and operated by the Town of Orange Park.  The site is located at 700 Ash Street, Orange Park, Clay County, Florida.

The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the chlorine building and water treatment plant chlorine room including the associated vent and exhaust systems.\n1.2.2. REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n Chlorine is the only regulated substance on site, which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The Town of Orange Park chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption and disinfecting the treated effluent wastewater before discharge to receiving waters.  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \n Chlorine is an EPA-and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the < shall assume that the < maximum quantity in the largest vessel < is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l, which equals 3 ppm. Th"

Two individual chlorine cylinders on individual weigh stations are used one at a time. The two cylinders are connected to the distribution systems.  The system then feeds to: \n7 Three chlorinators for the wastewater system, one for each plant and,\n7 Four chlorinators for the water treatment plant, one for each high service pump and one to the aerator.\nThese chlorinators inject chlorine into the plant water.  This water absorbs the chlorine, which reacts to hydro and hyper chloric acid that the chlorine gas is taken from the containers. The chlorinators for the wastewater treatment plants are automatically proportioned to the flow at the plants.  The chlorinators at the water treatment plant are manually adjusted as required to obtain required residual downstream of the distribution system. Chlorine gas is feed through a combination of P.V.C and special paraflex piping from the chlorine cylinders to the chlorinators and then to the injectors.  The chlorine gas piping for the wastewater plant injectors is located inside the main chlorine building.  However, the chlorine gas piping for the water treatment plant injectors extends from the main chlorine building to the water treatment plant chlorine room.  Hence the RMP boundary consists of both the main chlorine building and the water treatment plant building.\n3.2.2.2. A block flow diagram shows the major components and flow of the system.\n3.2.2.3. First, chlorine evaporates in the storage cylinders and remains as gas in the system. The chlorine undergoes no chemical reaction as it leaves the container.  The vacuum regulator check unit attached to the one-ton container is a vacuum activated unit.  Thus if there is no vacuum, the valves do not open.  This is a safe system, which reduces the possibility of a chlorine release.  Next the chlorine leaving the regulator is under vacuum pressure"

The Town of Orange Park following industry guidelines and takes great care to prevent unwanted reaction with chlorine and other substances, especially water.

It is stored in five DOT-approved one-ton cylinders.  A maximum of two containers are connected to the two chlorine distribution systems at one time.  Only one of these is in service.  When the in service container is empty, The automatic switchover unit switches and begins to draw chlorine form the stand by container.

Equipment Design\nThe chlorine high pressure piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel for high pressure systems or tubes and rated to 500 psig for the high pressure system and over 100 psig for the low pressure system. The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor. These materials in the high pressure system are chlorine compatible.  The materials in the low pressure or vacuum system are all chlorine compatible (not corroded by chlorine).
