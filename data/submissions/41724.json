This is a stationary source. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. \n\nThis is a first time RMP submission for a new ammonia refrigeration system. \n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility will be charged with anhydrous ammonia in June and July 2002. The ammonia inventory may exceed 10,000 pounds by late June. Total ammonia inventory will be approximately 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia by August 2002.\n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan is being provided to the local LEPC for review.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThis food processing facility operates a two-stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of 981 TR @ +20\u00b0F high temperature suction and 588 TR @ -50\u00b0F low temperature suction. This high-temperature side of the refrigeration system is a direct expansion system. The low-temperature side of the refrigeration system is a liquid-recirculating system and is designed to operate with an overfeed-ratio of approximately 4:1 for low-side air units. Anhydrous amm"

This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.

Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\nEngine room electrical classification is NEMA-1.\n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains six interconnected sub-systems:\n1. Low-temperature re-circulating evaporator system (-50\u00b0F @ 14\u00bf Hg).\n2. High-temperature evaporator system (+20\u00b0F @ 33.4 PSIG).\n3.

Compressor medium-temperature system (+20\u00b0F @ 33.4 PSIG).\n\nMajor equipment located inside the engine room includes:\n\u00b7Three low temperature booster-compressors (two M&M H375BT Screw Compressors each @ 270 TR/ 425 BHP and one M&M A65BT Screw Compressor @ 48 TR/ 82 BHP).\n\u00b7Three low temperature booster-compressors (two M&M A87ETF Screw Compressors each @ 356 TR/ 335 BHP and one M&M A65ETF Screw Compressor @ 269 TR/ 264 BHP).\n\u00b7One swing compressor (M&M H267HT Screw Compressor @ 191 TR/ 305 BHP on the low-side and 488 TR/ 500 BHP on the high-side). \n\u00b7One 84\u00bf dia. x 18\u00bf-0\u00bf high-pressure receiver.\n\u00b7One 10 dia. x 6'-0 OAL economizer.\n\u00b7One 72 dia. x 10'-0 OAL intercooler @ +20\u00b0F.\n\u00b7One 84 dia. x 11'-4 OAL vertical re-circulator package @ -50\u00b0F.\n\u00b7One-Hansen APC Auto-Purger.\n\nMajor equipment located outside on the roof includes:\n\u00b7Two evaporative condensers (both BAC VC2-1246, rated @ 7,297.2 MBH, for +90\u00b0 FCT/ 80\u00b0 FWB).\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for respond"

Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for hte RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials"

These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even replacement in kind) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate"
