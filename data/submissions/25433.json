If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify the\n Briit Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of Facility:\n This facility is a retail farm supplier. We sell anhydrous ammoina to famers for the purpose of crop\n production. On site we have one 12000 gallon storage tank and one 18000 gallon storage tank.\n These tanks are filled to a maximum of 85% capacity to allow for product expansion.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n Our worst case scenario is a gas release from one of the storage tanks. According to EPA's RMP Comp\n the distance to endpoint is 2.30 miles. There are residences with the distance to endpoint with a total\n of 260 people being affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles. There are residences within this distance. The amount of people affected would be one.\n\nThis faciity is equipped with excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs to minize the chances of a release occurring. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation  of the equipment and facility.We have also installed concrete barriers in the traffic pattern areas in an effort to eliminate damage from vehicular accident.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations. This facility is annually inspected by in-house personnel and by the Iowa Department\n of Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caus"
