According to EPA's RMP Comp\n the distance to endpoint is 2.30 miles. There are residences with the distance to endpoint with a total\n of 260 people being affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles. There are residences within this distance. The amount of people affected would be one.\n\nThis faciity is equipped with excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs to minize the chances of a release occurring. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation  of the equipment and facility.We have also installed concrete barriers in the traffic pattern areas in an effort to eliminate damage from vehicular accident.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations.
