North American Cold Storage, Inc. is located a 23202 Roemer Drive Woodburn, Indiana.\n\n\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nNorth American Cold Storage, Inc. uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of a variety of products. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management (RMP) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and OSHA Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM).  To date North American Cold Storage, Inc. has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment.\n\n\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  See supporting letter for details the worst and alternate case release scenarios and other scenarios considered.\n\n\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPursuant to RMP/PSM regulations, North American Cold Storage, Inc. has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed an initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and subsequent 5 Year PHA Revalidations for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).
