If a spill incident is beyond our own capabilities for whatever reason then our personnel are directed to call NEDT\u00bfs 24/7 Response Line.\n\nCoordination with Local Emergency Response Entities:\n\nMace Company provides local emergency response entities with information regarding our facility, what materials we store and use, and our emergency procedures. These information packages include a written copy of our emergency procedures as well as representative MSDS\u00bfs for all substances which may be present at our facility at any given time. These packages are sent to:\n\n1.Harrington Memorial Hospital, Southbridge, MA\n2.Hubbard Regional Hospital, Webster, MA\n3.The Town of Dudley, Selectman\u00bfs Office, Dudley, MA\n4.Dudley Fire Department, Dudley, MA\n5.Dudley Police Department, Dudley, MA\n6.State Emergency Response Commission, Framingham, MA\n7.Board of Health, Dudley, MA\n\nTo prevent substance release both inside and outside our facility and to ensure the safety of its employees and neighbors, Mace Company maintains extensive training, prevention, and hazard response programs. Details of said programs are available for review at our facilities."

Listed below is our Executive Summary.\n\nProgram Level:\nThe pertinent Mace Company Process (Prepolymer) is subject to Program 1 rules per:\nA. 40 CFR 68 Chapter 1 as shown in Exhibit 2-1 because we do not have any Public Receptors within the endpoint for a worst case release\nB. Exhibit 2-1 Mace Company has had no offsite impacts due to a release of a regulated substance from the Process.\nC. 40 CFR 68.10 Mace Company does not operate under one of the ten manufacturing NAICS codes that must fulfill Program 3 requirements.\n\n5 Year Accident History:\n\nMace Company has had no release of hazardous substances in its 40 year history.\n\nWorst Case Analysis:\n\nA minor release of a 40 CFR 68 regulated substance into the environment could be possible during off-loading from the freight carrier delivering the material (once inside the plant any substance releases would be contained within the walls of the building). The potential amount to be released would be 1 drum (551 lbs) or less. This could take place at our receiving dock during offloading of the substance where a drum could possibly fall off the dock and the container possibly breached. This scenario is very unlikely, especially since we have recently built a new Receiving Dock with a powered steel dock plate and a full dock seal which allows trucks to pull flush to the building leaving no room for a drop to occur.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nMace Company maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). This plan is implemented voluntarily by Mace Company to minimize risk to its employees, Public Receptors, and the environment. \n\nOur ERP starts with our internal \u00bffirst line of defense\u00bf strategy where we have written Emergency Response Procedures posted around the Plant with easy to read instructions for personnel on how to handle particular spills/hazards (said personnel also receive extensive ERP training).\n\nMace Company has contracted with NEDT of Shrewsbury, MA to be our second line of"
