Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nIn this facility, we use isopentane and isobutane which is considered flammable by the EPA. The same properties that make isopentane and isobutane valuable as blowing agents in our manufacturing process also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them. These precautions are in place to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isopentane and isobutane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees help insure the safety of our employees and our community.\nOur emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2) The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nA) At our Redwood City facility, FP International collects and recycles post consumer and industrial             polystyrene for the use in manufacturing of our product. During the manufacturing process blowing agents (a 50%-50% mixture of isopentane and isobutane) are injected into a polystyrene melt as it is extruded. One above ground 5,400 gallon storage tank is used to store the blowing agent mixture.\nB) The regulated substance is isobutane and isopentane.\nC) The maximum amount stored at this facility is 23,000 pounds.\n\n3)  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternate release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation meas"

      "SummaryText": "ures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\nRMP Comp used for modeling.\nA)Worst Case Scenario:\nFailure of the above ground tank when filled with the greatest amount of blowing agent allowed would release 23,000 pounds of the isopentane/isobutane mixture. Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of the tank to 85% at 60 degree F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source and results in a vapor cloud explosion.\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1psi for the worst case scenario is .2 miles.\nB) Alternate Scenario:\nA pull away causing failure of a 25 foot length of 2 square inch hose. The manualy operated emergency shut off valve will stop the flow. The contents of the hose is lost. Although it is unlikely, if the vapor reaches an ignition source it would result in a vapor cloud fire.\nThe estimated distance to the lower flammability limit is < .1 miles. This release has the potential of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4)  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58. As part of our corporate Injury and Illness Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to initial training, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if an employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our corporate Hazard Communications Plan, which is located in our safety manual contains, safe work practices, the use and care of personal  protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. Emergency and first-aid procedures are also"

We have dicussed this program with the San Mateo County Division of Environmental Health. \n\n7) Planned changes to improve safety.\nMonthly safety inspections are conducted at this facility and safety deficiencies are corrected as they occur. At this time no major upgrades to this facility are planned."
