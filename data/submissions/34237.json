Health safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of svery employee's job.  It is facility policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State Loval laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with it's Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work woth the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at this facility(the Stationary sourcr) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia I appoximately 149280, pounds strored in1 storage tank. The maximum fill level is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.                                                                                                                                           \nWorst case release scenario and alternate release scenario.\n      The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be149280, which represents the volume of storage at 85% of capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to thre end point is 4.4 miles. The alternate release scenario involves the release of anhydrous ammonia from a breakdown/rupture in a three/(3) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tank. The quantity of ammonia released as a gas would be approx"
