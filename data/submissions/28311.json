Founded in 1924, UNIVAR supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUNIVAR USAInc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by UNIVAR USA Inc. are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of this RMP Plan, including this Executive Summary, are prescribed by EPA.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program. Vopak USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Formaldehyde 37% Solution, Aqueous Ammonia 30%, and Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%. \n\nListed below are the ways the three RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n1. Formaldehyde 37% is received in 55 gal drums and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Formaldehyde onsite at anyone time will be 15,400 lbs in container storage.\n\n2. Aqueous Ammonia 30% is packaged and stored in 55 gal and 330 gal containers in our warehouse for distribution to our end use customers.  The estimated maximum inventory of Aqueous Ammonia 30% onsite at any one time will be 29,600 lbs in container storage.   \n\n3. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Hydrofluoric Acid onsite at any one time will be 32,300 lbs for container storage.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(Including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases fro"

Worse Case Scenario release of 385 lbs Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, the maximum distance of less than 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .016 mg/L.\n\n4. Alternate Case Scenario release of 80 lbs Formaldehyde 37% solution, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained using class D stability and wind speed 3m/s.\n\n5.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, UNIVAR USA  Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nVopak USA Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUNIVAR USA  Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at UNIVAR USA Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation UNIVAR USA Inc truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
