Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Heritage FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  IF an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Milford Fire Department, Iroquois County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of storage tank, rail cars, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.  \n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's)  \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with theses regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program. \n\n\n\n5.  Five year acciden"
