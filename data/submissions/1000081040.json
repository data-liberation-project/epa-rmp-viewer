The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device. If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 50 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\r\n\r\nThe engineer determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed. If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted. The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\r\n\r\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given, and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility.
