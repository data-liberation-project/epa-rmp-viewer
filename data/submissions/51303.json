      "SummaryText": "The City of Athens, Texas operates and maintains the West Wastewater treatment facility. The plant is located in a remote area away from the general populace.  The plant is down hill from town with the terrain continuing to fall away from town.  The city utilizes chlorine gas and sulphur dioxide gas in its treatment process.  The one ton containers these gases are contained within are ASME coded vessels.  During the design and construction of this plant, the engineers used guidelines set forth by the National Chlorine Insitute.  All external piping is protected from accidental damage by channel iron.  The feed equipment is inspected daily.  All personel that work inside the plant have received instructions and training in the safe handling of chlorine and sulphur dioxide gases as well as the use of self contained breathing apparatus.  Each employee is required to attend a class on how to read and interpret a Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)  within their first sixmonths of service.  As a first responder each has been trained in the proper procedure to shut down the chemical feed systems, or report to the emergency response personel.  The athens fire department is responsible for writingall emergency response procedures, and coordinates all emergency responses.  A copy of the City`s emergency response program has been filed with the Henderson County emergency response coordinators office.  Although a portion of town would be affected if the worst case scenario as described by the Environmental protection agency (EPA) were to occur, the probablity of such an occurrence is highly improbable due to the safegaurds built into the system, the physical properties of chlorine and sulphur dioxide gas, the geographical location and terrain around the plants location.  Any release of any amounts of gas capable of having any offsite consequence is unlikely.  There has not been any off site incident in the history of this plant.  The closest public receptor to the chlorine and "
