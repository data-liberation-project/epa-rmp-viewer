Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe Southeast Water Purification Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is the Southeast Water Purification Plant's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. This facility has a chlorine scrubber system for the storage building, along with chlorine leak detectors in the storage, feed and at all points of chemical application.  The leak detectors activate a visual and audible alarm that alerts the facility staff to any release.\n\nIf such a release does occur unforeseeably, the Southeast Water Purification Plant's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Drinking Water Operations has an assigned spill response coordinator in addition to the City of Houston Safety Department.  Additionally, the facility is also coordinated with the City of Houston's Hazardous Materials Response Unit and the City of Pasadena Park Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise.  \n\n2. The Stationary Sources and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Southeast Water Purification Plant's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area. There are two regulated substances present at the facility, chlorine and ammonia, both of which are used in the disinfection process. However, a RMP for ammonia is no longer required due to the decrease in the percent concentration being below 20%. Predictive modeling has been conducted for ammonia because of the potential for the facility to use a higher concentration"

The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 60,000 pounds.\n\n\n3. The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Southeast Water Purification Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that\nis in place at the plant's stationary source.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nSoutheast Water Purification Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, an equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nSoutheast Water Purification Plant conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is inspection of the plant to identify deficiencies throughout the system. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operation and are revalidated routinely. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner, with hazard items being deemed high priority and corrected first.\n\nOPERATION PROCEDURES\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the facility's covered processes, Southeast Water Purification Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal\nshutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTRAINING\n\nSoutheast Wate"

Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nSoutheast Water Purification Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment by these checks includes among others: pressure valves, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Southeast Water Purification Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on February 12, 2009. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at Southeast Water Purification Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nSoutheast Water Purification Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rules are being implemented. These Audits are carried out at least once every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release form reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nSoutheast Water Purification Plant truly believes that process safely management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rules, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nOn occasions, Southeast Water Purification Plant hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of contractor is carried out. Southeast Water Purification Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nSoutheast Water Purification Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental release of a regulated substance over the last five years. Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Southeast Water Purification Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medic"
