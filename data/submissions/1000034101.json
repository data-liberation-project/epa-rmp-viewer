In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.\r\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe existing ammonia refrigeration system at Carla's Pasta, 50 Talbot Lane, South Windsor CT is a two stage ammonia refrigeration process consisting of compressors, one evaporative condenser, a high pressure thermosyphon receiver, an intermediate pressure intercooler, a low pressure ammonia recirculation package, evaporators, and other equipment. The existing system has an ammonia inventory of less than 10,000-lbs.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is being expanded to add sp"

To support the additional process equipment, two new compressors and a second evaporative condenser are being added to the central ammonia refrigeration plant. Estimated new operating ammonia charge for this facility will be greater than 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Carla's Pasta is primarily used to freeze freshly made pasta food products. \r\n\r\nThe Toxic Worst Case Scenario (WCS) assumes failure of the high pressure receiver V1 HPR which could hold 80% of capacity (the largest single vessel in the system) during a complete NH3 pumpdown. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Toxic Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) postulates a failure of a 2-inch liquid line on the recirculation package located within the compressor room.  Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because considered a more likely scenario. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: NH3 area detectors/emergency shutdown activation; automatic shutdown activation (pump sensor); the facility mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; an"

Employees and management participate and cooperate in both process safety programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no ammonia releases in the last 5-years that meet USEPA's Five-Year reporting requirement.\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program includes a personnel evacuation plan. An evacuation drill is conducted on an annual basis.  There are ammonia sensors located throughout the facility that trigger an audible facility-wide alarm. The audible facility alarms are tested on an annual basis. \r\n\r\nThe facility plans to implement a Roof Access Log to control personnel access and accountability in the event of an emergency."
