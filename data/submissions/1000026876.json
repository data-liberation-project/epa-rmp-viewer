It is the intent of the Nashville Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2011) into this process. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Nashville Fire Department as well as the City of Nashville Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (Nashville Fire Department Paramedics/EMS Bureau) and St. Thomas Hospital.  The nearest Level 1 Trauma Center is Vanderbuilt University Medical Center. \n\n\n\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC - Nashville Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC - Nashville Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Sunoco Part"

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the City of Nashville Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.  The Nashville Fire Department and HazMat has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices. Additional vessel protection includes an intumescent coating. Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection.\n\n\n\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, The Nashville Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.  Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n"
