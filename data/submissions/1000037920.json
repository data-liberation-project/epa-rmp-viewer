The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this alternative scenario with a successive explosion would be 0.4 miles from the source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because processes at the refinery are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nCalumet San Antonio Refining, LLC, has established a Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC) consisting of employees from all operational facets to review, evaluate and make recommendations to management on the safe operation of the plant processes. The company also encourages employees to participate in the plants safety and loss control program. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery safety and accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCalumet San Antonio Refining, LLC, keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain sa"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nAll changes will be reviewed by an engineer, the plant inspector, operators and maintenance craftsman and a contracted professional engineer if considered necessary.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nCalumet San Antonio Refining, LLC, promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nFormal compliance audit will be conducted every 3 years.
