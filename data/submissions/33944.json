With input from the CUPA, the use of anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) in a closed-loop refrigeration process and under a separate process, anhydrous ammonia will be used in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to control nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions from a one Mega Watt natural gas fired turbine.  These processes at the facility trigger the CalARP/RMP requirements.  These processes were determined to be covered by Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\nOn March 31, 2004, the amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r) (7) was signed. The amendment:\n\n\u00bf\tRequires a correction to reportable information on chemical accidents be added to the RMP within six (6) months of the date of the accident;\n\u00bf\tRequires that changes to emergency contact information be corrected within one (1) month;\n\u00bf\tRemoves the requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the RMP executive summary; and\n\u00bf\tAdds three (3) RMP data elements.\n\nEPA also amended the RMP*Submit format to expand the list of possible accident causes to include uncontrolled chemical reactions.  As part of this rulemaking, EPA also clarified that the five (5) year deadline for updating RMPs that were originally filed early (i.e., submitted before June 21, 1999), is June 21, 2004.  This amendment became effective on April 9, 2004 when it was published in the Fed"

To achieve this end, Gills Onions strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nGills Onions emergency response policies are implemented to comply with the overall company policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and minimizing risk to the public.  The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel must have priority; therefore, all procedures must be carried out in the appropriate manner.  Only then can safely executed rescue and medical activities be considered.  Another priority is protection of the environment.  Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the focus shift to the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery.\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nOxnard is located on the southern margin of the Oxnard Plain, approximately 5 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 50 miles west of Los Angeles, California.  The elevation of the facility is approximately 35 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake faults are the Pitas Point-Ventura Fault, approximately 8 miles to the northwest and the Anacapa (Dume) Fault, approximately 16 miles to the southwest located in the Pacific Ocean.  The Anacapa (Dume) Fault produced a 5.9 magnitude earthquake in 1973. \n\nThe facility is located in a limited industrial (M-2) zone at 1051 South Pacific Avenue.  The facility covers approximately 14 acres and is bounded on the north by Mountain View Avenue, on the east by Pacific Avenue and on the south by Wooley Road.  The Ventura County Railway Spur runs along the western property line which is shared with other light industrial facilities to the west. The nearest major highway is"

The next nearest residential area, La Puerta Street in La Colonia neighborhood, is approximately 0.65 miles to the northeast.  The Oxnard Community Center Complex is approximately 1.25-miles to the west and the Center Point Mall is approximately 1.1 miles to the southwest.  These are considered public receptors under the RMP regulation. The nearest environmental receptor is a Natural Preserve approximately 6 miles northwest of the facility.  The Natural Preserve is located just north of McGrath State Beach on the Santa Clara River outlet to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe facility is designed to process and store onions.  Processing includes washing, peeling, dicing, and packaging onions.  The cold storage room, shipping dock, and receiving vestibule are designed to store onions at 34\u00b0F by means of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A block flow diagram of the refrigeration system is contained in Appendix A along with applicable piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs).  The refrigeration system is designed to cool indoor air in processing rooms to approximately 40-50\u00b0F, to 34\u00b0F in cold storage, and to chill process water to below 40\u00b0F.\n\nMajor process steps include the following:\n\na)\tcompression;\nb)\tcondensers;\nc)\thigh pressure receiver;\nd)\tpumping units;\ne)\tevaporators, air handling units, and water chillers\nf)\tdiffuser (emergency only). \n\nThe entire system has the capacity to hold 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop system.  \n1.3  Regulated Substances\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) under pressure: 20,000 pounds in a closed-loop refrigeration process at pressure and temperature ranges of 38 to 154 psig and +24 to 160\u00b0F in both vapor and liquid states (depending on process step).  \n\nUnder a separate process, anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) un"

This process utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the capacity of a SCR for the Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  The SCR system reduces NOX  emissions by injecting ammonia into the exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst matrix.  Nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and oxygen react on the surface of the catalyst to form nitrogen and water.  The catalyst is comprised of a noble metal and works within a high temperature range for proper operations (800\u00b0 F to 1100\u00b0F).  As such, the control efficiency of the SCR system is reducing NOX emissions to about 90 percent.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nSince the facility\u00bfs construction in 1999, there have been no recorded incidents.\n\n1.5\tPrevention Program\n\nIn addition to implementation of the RMP Prevention Program 3 elements, Gills Onions has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases of regulated (and other) substances at the facility.  The following are some of the control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials at the Gills Onions Facility:\n\n\u00bf\tRelief and/or safety valves\n\u00bf\tEmergency Control Stations\n\u00bf\tFire Protection System\n\u00bf\tEmergency Shutdown Systems (ESD)\n\u00bf\tLeak Alarms\n \nCompliance with RMP and CalARPs comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable or toxic materials.
