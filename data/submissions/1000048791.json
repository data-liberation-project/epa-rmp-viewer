Facility Accidental Release Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of CALARCO, Inc., Hansen facility (herein referred to as the Facility), located north of the intersection of  7th Avenue & Redding Avenue, Corcoran, California, 93212, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, CALARCO is prepared to work with the Kings County Fire Department (first response), and other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one, 18,000-gallon, limited-capacity, aboveground, stationary storage tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is approximately 78,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\n A.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case Scenario  \r\nThe worst-case release scenario is total failure of the stationary storage vessel.  When filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations, 78,000  pounds (17,972 gallons equivalent) of anhydrous ammonia would be released.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.1 miles.     \r\n\r\n B. Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario is a release of 48,000 pounds (11,060 gallons equivalent) from an externally-caused puncture in the vessel with an area of 2 square inches.  This leakage amount is 61.44% of the total permitted capacity of the tank.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.  \r\n\r\n4.

Caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, or have\r\n   b.
