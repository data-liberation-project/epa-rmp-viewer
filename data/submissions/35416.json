The CM2WTP provides drinking water for over 25,000 people in Anne Arundel County.  The facility is designed to primarily remove solids and metals from ground water before providing the water for drinking water purposes in the distribution system in West Central Anne Arundel County.  As part of this treatment system, chlorine is used to effect disinfection.  Chlorine is stored at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  Chlorination is a common process used by many water treatment plants in the United States.\n\nAnne Arundel County Department of Public Works personnel have designed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to ensure safe operation of the chlorination process.  As part of the PSM program, a process hazards analysis has been conducted to evaluate the safety of the process.  The minimum amount of chlorine needed to meet this facility's Safe Drinking Water Act  requirements is stored in an enclosed brick building.  Standard operating procedures have been written for the safe handling and use of chlorine cylinders.  Annual training is provided to facility personnel in the safe handling and use of chlorine, and a strict preventive maintenance program has been implemented for the process.  A monitor has been installed in the building to detect any leaks.  If a leak is detected, the building ventilation system shuts off automatically, preventing any chemical from escaping from the storage building.  In the event of a leak, Anne Arundel County Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) unit is contacted and, if necessary, they will slowly and safely mitigate the situation under controlled conditions.  No releases of chlorine have occurred at the facility that have resulted in any off-site impacts.\nCoordination"

This relationship between the HAZMAT unit and CM2WTP personnel has fostered open communication and coordination of emergency response procedures and the safe handling and storage practices for chlorine. Through this cooperative effort and the ongoing process safety management procedures at the facility, Anne Arundel County will continue to operate the CM2WTP in an environmentally safe manner."
