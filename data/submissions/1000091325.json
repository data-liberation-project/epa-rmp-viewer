      "SummaryText": "chemicals to our employees. We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of our processes.  Each chemical process is analyzed utilizing a method designed to identify, prevent and minimize the effects of hazards such as fire, chemical release, process control and explosions. The utilization of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) techniques has been applied at Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products for many years. The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes. We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes. Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their affects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations. Written operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products has specific operating procedures developed by people knowledgeable in the operation of that area, the operators and area supervisors. Besides standard operating procedures, Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators. These training materials have been developed by the operators themselves and include their knowledge from years of on-the-job service. The training program is supported with computer based training modules as well as hands-on training by qualified area trainers. Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products operators are required to complete a training program before becoming fully qualified. \nMechanical integrity of plant equipment is another way Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products reduces the probability and consequences of potential releases. On-going inspection programs are a"

Evacuation procedures are included in the emergency response plan.  Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products has its own emergency response brigade made up of trained, qualified, certified emergency response individuals. These emergency responders receive additional training in chemical plant emergency response and many have been trained at nationally known emergency response schools. These plans and responses to incidents are tested annually through drills involving the brigade and emergency service personnel. The brigade receives periodic training e.g., tabletop drills and hands-on exercises, throughout the year.\n\n(6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nHoneywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products strives to continually improve process safety at the site. Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment. Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents. The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance. Also, Honeywell Baton Rouge Fluorine Products benchmarks companies to achieve a higher level of safety, and comprehensive incident investigations enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents. As one part of the investigation tool, we have trained employees in root cause analysis, an investigative system designed to identify and correct the causes of equipment and procedural failures. It is widely used to help improve our level of safety and environmental performance. Managing change is a key activities task associated with process safety and risk management. Detailed procedural steps have been developed to provide guidance for operations per"
