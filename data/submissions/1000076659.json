The Mosaic Crop Nutrition distribution facility, handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our employees and nearby community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations, and we are committed to conducting business and operating our facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees and surrounding community.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe Mosaic Henderson KY Terminal receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia that the Terminal receives is unloaded from river barges at the dock and transferred via an above ground pipeline to two interconnected above-ground low-pressure storage tanks.  The ammonia is later transferred from the terminal's low pressure storage tanks to one of 12 truck unloading stations, so that it can then be transported to the terminal's downstream customers.  Anhydrous ammonia is classified as a regulated toxic substance by the EPA.  The Mosaic Henderson KY Terminal does not maintain any other chemicals, besides anhydrous ammonia, that are classified as a regulated toxic and/or flammable material by the EPA in quantities above those listed in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 in section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\n\nThe Mosaic Henderson KY Terminal has an extensive safety program to ensure compliance with all applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations. The facility operates under a Corporate Environmental Health and Safety Policy that end"

The design, maintenance and operation of the facility are carried out in conformance with this policy to provide a safe operation and to prevent exposures of our employees and nearby neighbors to ammonia.  The Mosaic Henderson KY terminal's management personnel are responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy.  The programs and procedures are continually reviewed and updated, and the facility is periodically audited to assure compliance.  The Terminal is a non-responding facility as outlined in 40 CFR 68.90(b).  The facility is linked to a community alarm that provides emergency notification to nearby neighbors. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe Mosaic Henderson KY Terminal is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  As recognized by EPA, the PSM standard forms the basis for the agency's RMP prevention program component. The primary purpose of the PSM program is to safeguard employees and nearby neighbors from exposure to ammonia by providing assistance in evaluating and updating the facility's process and mechanical safety procedures and programs.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Mosaic Henderson KY Terminal prevention program are:\n\n1) The facility has automated emergency shutdown systems with isolation valves to minimize a potential release;\n\n2) Continuous monitoring and surveillance are conducted by operating personnel via computer and remote cameras;\n\n3) System design incorporates multiple layers of protection including: flare system, emergency power sources, pressure relief valves, and leak detectors;\n\n4) Plant personnel receive Process Safety Management training;\n\n5) Traffic is strictly controlled throughout the facility; and\n\n6) Site access is controlled and monitored.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident Hi"

The terminal's employees have been trained on the terminal's emergency action plan, as required by 29 CFR 1910.38.  However, the terminal's employees are not authorized to respond to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe Mosaic Henderson KY Terminal is committed to implementing, reviewing, and updating its PSM and RMP programs to ensure the continued safe operation of the terminal's covered anhydrous ammonia process.  In addition, the Mosaic Henderson, KY Terminal plans to continue to provide support to, and work with, the local emergency planning committee and emergency response agencies to plan and/or drill for a potential emergency at the terminal. \n\n"
