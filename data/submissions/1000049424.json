Cattle are harvested, chilled, and processed to primal cuts, which are stored at an off-site facility.  The facility employs approximately 1,100 employees.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in a single stage, self-contained refrigeration system to provide cooling to the process areas, carcass coolers, and to chill process water.  This refrigeration system comprises the process at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years which resulted in death, injury, or property damage to the facility site, or which resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented a prevention program which coincides with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119; EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation, 40 CFR Part 68; the State of Wisconsin's Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration and LP Gas Inspection Report, Ref Code: Chapter 45. The purpose of the program is to prevent occurrences, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances, fire, explosion and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program elements consist of:\n\n\n\n    -Employee Participation        \n\n    -Process Safety Information        \n\n    -Process Hazard Analysis    \n\n    -Operating Procedures        \n\n    -Hot Work Permit            \n\n    -Management of Change        \n\n    -Preventative Maintenance\n\n        -Training\n\n        -Contractor    \n\n        -Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n        -Mechanical Integrity\n\n        -Incident Investigation\n\n        -Compliance Audits\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn Ammonia Response Plan is in effect at the facility which contains pre-planning with local agencies, an Incide"

There is also provision for emergency response training and PPE issue and inspection.  The Ammonia Response Plan is part of the Emergency Action Plan which contains evacuation procedures, medical treatment procedures, and contact information for company and local resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario Summary\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a complete release of pressurized anhydrous ammonia from the largest high pressure receiver located on the roof.  Selection of this vessel is consistent with Appendix E (Supplemental Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration) in the General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention, which states that the worst-case release quantity is the greater of the following:\n\n\n\n?    The greatest amount held in a vessel taking into account the administrative controls on maximum quantity; or\n\n?    The greatest amount held in piping.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia inventory data indicates this is the largest vessel, contains 116,999.64 pounds of ammonia, and it contains a greater amount of ammonia than is held in piping.  Calculations were rounded up to 17,000 pounds for convenience.  There are no passive mitigation measures in place.  Ammonia is a liquid under pressure which readily converts to a gas at normal atmosphere and temperature.  The facility is located in a mixed industrial and residential area within the city of Green Bay, WI.  The following assumptions are made about the worst-case scenario:\n\n\n\n?    the total quantity of contents in the HPR is released in a 10-minute period\n\n?    wind speed is 1.5 meters per second\n\n?    toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/l) \n\n?    urban setting\n\n?    F class weather stability \n\n\n\nUsing EPA's RMPComp software with the above assumptions produced an estimated  0.7 mile radius to the toxic endpoint.  Population data was created by using t"

Selection of the scenario was made by reviewing a list of 'what if' scenarios from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis which were expected to result in releases leading to off-site odor detection and which resulted in a A, B, or C rating on the Process Hazard Analysis' risk matrix. \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario selected consists of a fan blade breaking apart in evaporative condenser 3 on the roof resulting in a release of ammonia under pressure from a 1\" diameter hole in the coils.  The following assumptions are made for the secenario:  \n\n\n\n?    System pressure is 130 psig,\n\n?    Wind speed of 3 meters per second,\n\n?    Toxic endpoint of 200 ppm ( 0.14 mg/l) for ammonia,\n\n?    Urban setting,\n\n?    D class weather stability.\n\n\n\nUsing EPA's RMPComp software with the above assumptions produced an estimated  0.1 mile radius to the toxic endpoint.  Population data was created by using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) version 10C, which indicates a population of 191 people would be within the 0.1 mile area of the release.\n\n\n\nThis alternate case scenario is unlikely for the following reasons\n\n\n\n?
