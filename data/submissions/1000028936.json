The Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies At The Stationary Source:\n\n\n\nThe management of Brook Warehousing Corporation is committed to a practice that promotes a sense of concern and responsibility for the environment and safety of their associates. The facility promotes safety and environmental responsibility by implementing systems that help minimize the potential for catastrophic releases of chemicals that could affect worker safety and environment.  The Facility's Emergency Response Plan along with the Local Emergency Planning Committee systematically controls emergency response activities and promotes worker and environmental safety, as well as public health.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage at the Facility within the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nThe Facility is regulated under the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Spill Compensation and Control Act (N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11) and has developed a Discharge Prevention, Containment and Countermeasure / Discharge Cleanup and Removal (DPCC / DCR) Plan in accordance with those requirements.  Best Management Practices (BMP's) have been identified and implemented to ensure practices and procedures are conducted in a manner that ensures continual improvement in the safe handling of hazardous materials.  Compliance with BMP's as well as this Risk Management Plan is verified by conducting internal audits on a regular basis (at least monthly).\n\n\n\nb.    The Stationary Source And Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nStationary Source- The Stationary Source consists of a 100,000 ft2 warehouse. The regulated substances are stored in a 5,000 ft2closed storage room located in the center of the warehouse.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\n\n\nPhosphorous Oxychloride (CAS #10025-87-3) regulated by"
