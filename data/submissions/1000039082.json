              "Description": "Ammonia Refrigeration is the primary method of cooling at Cargill, Mt. Crawford, VA.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system that is a characterized as change of state of the ammonia to cool the facility by absorbing heat into the ammonia and discharging this heat through the condensing tower to the environment.  The preventative program is primarily a complete preventative maintenance program completed by facility employees and outside contractors to minimize the potential of a release.  The entire facility group of the maintenance department is involved with completion of the preventative maintenance program and the compliance with the 14 elements of PSM and RMP.  As found, changes are made to the preventative maintenance program to constantly improve the preventative maintenance program.   Training for all employees is completed as required to comply with PSM and RMP.  The facility also has a dedicated PSM coordinator to assist with the compliance with the PSM and RMP program.   ",

Crawford, Virginia.  The facility has two interconnected refrigeration systems which contain anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe location has prepared worst case and alternative case release scenarios using the ALOHA air dispersion modeling software which calculates the distance to the toxic endpoints. \n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility?s ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelteri"
