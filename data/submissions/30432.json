      "SummaryText": "1.    The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nAt the Erie County Sewer District No. 2 (ECSD #2) Big Sister Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), personnel are continually concerned with the safety of employees, the public, and the environment. The Accidental Release Prevention Program mandates operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at the Big Sister Creek WWTP.  To prevent possible releases of regulated substances, appropriate controls and techniques are used.  If such a release does occur, personnel at the Big Sister Creek WWTP, through the Division of Sewerage Management (DSM) are coordinated with the Erie County Department of Emergency Services and the Evans Center Volunteer Fire Department, whom all commit highly trained emergency response crews to help control and ease the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (primary activities, use of regulated substances, & quantities handled or stored)\n\n?    The Big Sister Creek WWTP primary activity involves the treatment of wastewater.  Presently, there is one (1) regulated toxic substance above threshold quantity at the Big Sister Creek WWTP, which is Chlorine (Cl2).  According to the regulations, the Big Sister Creek WWTP is required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n?    Chlorine is used for the disinfection of wastewater, primarily to destroy and/or deactivate pathogenic organisms.\n\n?    The maximum inventory at the Big Sister Creek WWTP is four (4) one-ton (2,000 lb.) tanks.   \n\n\n3. \n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAt the ECSD #2 Big Sister Creek WWTP, personnel have taken all the steps needed to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, found in 40 CFR Part 68.  The Big Sister Creek WWTP is subject to the OSHA PSM and EPCRA section 302 standards.  A brief description of the elements in the"

The methodology used to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process was the What If/Checklist.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is reviewed and updated (if necessary) and revalidated every five (5) years.  Any changes resulting from the PHA are completed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTo safely conduct activities involved within the process, Big Sister Creek WWTP personnel maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address each operating phase including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after an emergency shutdown.  Each year, the Chief WWTP Operator reviews the operating procedures and certifies in the annual report that all current operating practices are reflected.  In addition, all operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the process.\n\nTraining\nThe Big Sister Creek WWTP has an extensive training program in place to ensure that employees involved with the process are completely knowledgeable about the operating procedures and hazards associated with them.  Mandated refresher training is provided at least every five (5) years and more often if necessary, to each employee involved in operating the process.  Currently, training is ongoing throughout the year in many areas.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nAt the Big Sister Creek WWTP, personnel carry out routine maintenance checks, inspections, and testing on all process equipment to ensure proper functioning.

Any equipment deficiencies that are outside acceptable limits are corrected in a safe and timely manner to assure safe operation.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are established at the Big Sister Creek WWTP to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Any employee whose job tasks are affected by a change in the process is informed and trained.\n\nPre-startup Reviews \nPre-startup safety reviews related to modifications in the established process are conducted as needed.  These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, safety, operations, and maintenance procedures are in place prior to startup.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Big Sister Creek WWTP evaluates compliance at least every five (5) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audit are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDuring the past five (5) years, there have not been any incidents at the Big Sister Creek WWTP.  If and when the occasion arises, any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a disastrous release of a regulated substance would promptly be investigated. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Big Sister Creek WWTP has incorporated any appropriate employee comments into the Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) (Appendix A).  In addition, all employees have access to the information developed under this standard. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the Big Sister Creek WWTP hires outside contractors to perform maintenance and/or construction work.

In addition, contractors will be explained any applicable provisions of the Emergency Response Plan (Appendix C).\n\n\n5.    The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Big Sister Creek WWTP has an outstanding record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to effective release prevention, no accidental releases have occurred over the last five (5) years.\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Big Sister Creek WWTP has a written Emergency Response Plan (Appendix C) that deals with accidental releases. The procedure includes aspects of emergency response including monitoring and detection, notifications following a release, direction and control, containment, evacuations, mutual aid assistance, emergency equipment inventory, first aid, review, updates and training, and other emergencies.  The emergency response equipment is inspected, tested, and maintained in accordance with the DSM Respirator Program.  The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the process.\n\nThe Facility Emergency Coordinators (FEC) for the Big Sister Creek WWTP are:\n?    Sewer District Manager - Larry Krug - 716 823 8704 - krugl@erie.gov\n?    Chief WWTP Operator - Ron Schifano - 716 823 8704 - schifanr@erie.gov\n?
