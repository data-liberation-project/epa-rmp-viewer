      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - Tremco is committed to the protection of our employees, our neighbors and the environment through proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our equipment. We achieve this objective through the commitment of personnel and financial resources to improve release prevention and the integrity of our equipment. Additionally, we are committed to the ongoing process of emergency planning. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have implmented.                                                                  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled - The facility manufactures caulks, sealants and weatherproofing materials used by the construction and consumer markets. The products are manufactured using a variety of materials and simple blending and packaging operations. Some of the products produced are polyurethane polymer based. In some of the processes, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is used which the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a significant accidental uncontrolled release. The facility stores the TDI in a storage tank that is located in an enclosed, contained building. The TDI is pumped to several blending kettles where it is reacted with polyols and other materials. The finished products that are produced contain only very low residual levels of TDI.                                      General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps - The facility employs a combination of technology, a proactive management approach and employee training to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Some of the spill prevention improvements the facility has implmented include redundant overfill protection devices and alarms on storage tanks, continuous training on spill prevention and the ongoing practice of conduct"

Five-Year Accident History - The facility has had no significant accidental releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the last 5 years.                                                                                                                                                 Emergency Response Program - The site maintains an updates and Emergency Response Contingency Plan (Emergency Action Plan (EAP)) which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response preparedness and planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training requirements for the effective protection of our employees, neighbors and the environment during an emergency situation. Additionally, we ensure that our facility is included in the community emergency response plan.                                                                                                                                   Planned Changes to Improve Safety - The facility has the philosophy of continuous improvement and is constantly looking for and implementing changes to the operations to minimize potential unplanned releases. The facility is committed to conducting comprehensive engineering and safety reviews (PHAs) of all processes to identify opportunities for improvement."
