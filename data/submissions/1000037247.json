The Adena facility has over the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated highly hazardous chemical per the U.S. .Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 40 CFR-68 RMP and OSHA 29CFR 1910-119PSM.  Adena Beef has a unified Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program that are presented in this plan.\n\n\n\nThe Plant first received ammonia in November 2013 and had developed this plan.\n\n\n\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\n\nAdena Beef's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the EPA, RMP and OSHA's PSM program.\n\n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n\nAdena Beef has a management system in place which is led by the Adena Beef's Plant Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of PSM/RMP elements.  This program, along with other facility-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of an ammonia release at the facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's Process Safety Information.\n\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n\nAdena Beef maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of its prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, as well as PSM elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the Adena Beef plant Document Management System (DMS).  The unified PSM/RMP program was implemented in November, 2013 prior to receipt of the maximum inventory above the 10,000-pound threshold.\n\n\n\n1.2.

SITE DESCRIPTION (B)(1)\n\nThe site is owned and operated by Adena Meat Products. Limited Partnership (Adena Meat)  The site is located at either 19789 CR 315 or NE 199 St. Rd., Ft. McCoy, FL.\n\nThe Plant includes a separate ammonia operation storage room and adjacent control room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to PSM/RMP regulation include the bulk ammonia storage and feed control rooms and the associated coolers and freezer evaporation units as well as the vent makeup and exhaust systems.  \n\nAmmonia is delivered to numerous refrigerator units and returns to the compressor room where it is cooled and liquefied for further use in the roof-mounted condenser.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n1.2.2.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b)(2)\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold quantity.  Adena's ammonia process was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Ammonia's formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression.\n\n\n\n1.3.    WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\n\nTwo off-site consequence analyses were conducted which include two ammonia release scenarios.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative"

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the ...shall assume that the &#61628; maximum quantity in the largest vessel &#61628; is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur as the worst-case scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA specified endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/l.  This endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\n1.3.1.    WORST CASE   (c)(1)\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions outlined in RMP-Comp.  Results demonstrate a distance of 1.0 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at zero residences.* The area within the one mile radius is best any churches, schools, residences, recreation, industrial, as well as historic areas\n\n1.3.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a pipe or valve in the ammonia system.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16-inch diameter hole in a pipe, valve or even a vessel.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA's ammonia"

These materials are steel or ammonia compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by ammonia) rated to 2,500 psig.  The typical pressure of the ammonia in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a substantive safety factor.  This system is extensive, leading from the ammonia compressor room to each of the individual refrigerator or freezer units.  \n\nThe medium and low pressure system operates under a positive pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also ammonia compatible.  Ammonia from the freezers returns at six psig and ammonia from the refrigeration units retunes at 20 psig.  The high pressure system is designed using schedule 80 seamless pipe and fittings designed 2,500 psig giving it a large safety factor over the typical positive pressure in the high pressure system. The low pressure system uses schedule 40 pipe and fittings and is rated from 450 to 1.000 psig.  The low pressure system operates at 6 psig for freezer return lines and 20 psig for ref"

There are four  ammonia monitors which detects the presence of ammonia in the compressor room storage area and vent relief stack from the ammonia system.  The alarm system not only alarms it also is tied into the equipment controls and can shut down the compressors in the event of a high level of ammonia in the compressor room.\n\nThe entire ammonia systems is monitored and is sent to a wireless system that enables staff to be in constant communication with the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.5.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (e)\n\nThere have been zero EPA recorded accidents in the past five years as this was written prior to plant startup.\n\n\n\n1.6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (f)\n\nEmergency response procedures contain the Plant Emergency Response Policy and are coordinated with the Marion County (Emergency Response Plan) and the LEPC.  The plan includes an emergency response \"decision tree\" and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted by the Maintenance and Operations departments.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\n\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Plant Wide Safety Committee and the Marion County City Fire/Rescue Stations.  The plant coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Marion County Fire Department HazMat team.  All are located in Marion County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and plant physician.  In addition to the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the Adena Beef plant.\n\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to an ammonia spill (release).  The plan includes training of all"

Adena Beef fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the ammonia system operation.\n\n?    RMP safety teams\n\n?    Development of the operation procedures\n\n?    Hazard evaluations and Process Hazards Analysis \n\n?    On-going training of the operators and other ammonia involved staff\n\n\n\n1.7.    CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (g)\n\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the recent internal safety, tour, and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Process Safety Management / Risk Management Prevention Programs.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  A Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on November 6, 2013 to review the RMP program.  The key safety action items were completed including submission of the RMP e*Submit to the EPA.  See the \"Update\" Section 6 of that report.\n\nAdena Beef continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the Adena Beef management team and process safety team are reviewing potential of the existing design of the ammonia operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of ammonia.\n\n"
