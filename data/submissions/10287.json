Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen is used by our refinery customers to manufacture \"clean fuels.\"  Hydrocarbon based gases (including natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feed stock is then compressed and \"cracked\" in our reformer (furnace).  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the "

The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to customers via our underground pipeline network. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable gas mixture.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:\n\n7 38,000 pounds of flammable gas containing approximately 13% hydrogen and 12% methane\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\", as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of flammable substances in the hydrogen process at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving a maximum inventory of a PSA vessel containing a flammable mixture.  A full PSA vessel inventory of 3,900 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for this WCS reaches public receptors.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe \"alternative case scenario\" (ACS)  for flammable substance at this facility is a flash fire resulting from the failure of a reformer pigtail tube.  The entire inventory of the reformer and connecting vessels of 3500 pounds of a flammable mixture is assumed to be released.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined flammable endpoint of 100% LFL (Low Flammability Limit) for this ACS reaches public receptors.\n\nIn 1996, a large pipe failed at a similar facility. The sudden release of gas pressure within the plant resulted in effects similar to those of a vapor cloud explosion. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a large pipe failure might be reported as "

      "SummaryText": "the required alternative case scenario. However, a large pipe failure would have the consequences similar to the worst case, and the analysis of this scenario would provide little new information to emergency responders. Therefore, we have chosen to report, as an alternative case scenario, a fire which emergency responders could be called upon to control and ultimately extinguish.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements  based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility came on line in January of 1996.  There have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Los Angeles City Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
