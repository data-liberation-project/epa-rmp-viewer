This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Bakersfield Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189,the EPA Risk Management Prorgram regulations at 40CFR Part 68 and 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The Bakersfield Terminal receives stores and distributes LPG and natural gasoline by rail cars and/or transport trucks.  The terminal has a number of storage tanks used for the receipt, storage and redelivery of natural gasoline and liquefied petroleum gases.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold LPG or natural gasoline at 85% maximum capacity, and are configured to store one or more of the various products that can be handled by the terminal.  \n\n\n\nThe Bakersfield Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Bakersfield Terminal.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.
