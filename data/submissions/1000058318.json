      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nCoronado Midstream LLC owns and operates a Program 1 natural gas processing facility, the Lobo Gas Processing Plant in Loving County, Texas. the plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nCoronado Midstream LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. this commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Lobo Gas Processing Plant is located near Mentone, Texas. From Mentone, travel 6.25 miles northeast on Hwy 302. Facility is on left.\r\n\r\nThe facility is an approximate 1300-foot by 600-foot gas processing facility. natural gas from the inlet separators/slug catchers is compressed by compressors prior to entering the dehydration unit. After dehydration, the inlet gas enters the cryogenic plant where the gas is cooled and natural gas liquids (NGL) are condensed. The NGL is then pipelined from the facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility produces the below listed petroleum products.\r\n1. Stabalized Condensate\r\n2. NGL\r\n3. Residue gas\r\nThese Substance can contain the following components:\r\n1.Methane"
