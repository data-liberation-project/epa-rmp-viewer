The same properties that make gas chlorine an extremely effective disinfectant in water treatment also make it necessary to observe stringent safety precautions in order to reduce the threat to human health and the environment, to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community, and to prevent unnecessary human exposure. It is Ute Water's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. The safety of our covered process is dependent upon the manner in which we handle chlorine gas, the engineered safety devices used in the design of the facility, and the effective training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the EPA Guidance Document General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68) (EPA, 2009) and our program is audited using the EPA Guidance Document Guidance for Auditing Risk Management Plans/Programs under Clean Air Action Section 112(r) (EPA, 1999). Our emergency response plan is reviewed and updated annually and explains actions to be taken in the case of a minor or major chlorine gas leak including alerting emergency responders, evacuating the facility, and notifying neighboring residences.\n\n \n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Ute Water Conservancy District is a public water system serving approximately 86,000 residents throughout the greater Grand Junction area in Mesa County, Colorado. The Ute Water Treatment Plant (stationary source-located outside Palisade, Colorado) has been safely producing potable water disinfected with gas chlorine since 1964. The regulated substance handled at this facility is gas chlorine and a maximum of 20,000 lbs of gas chlorine can be stored on-site.\n\n\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n"

Clearly written Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine container change-overs and receiving of ton containers. All SOPS are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n?    Annual chlorine safety training, respiratory-wearer training, fit testing and medical qualification exams are performed for all individuals involved in chlorine container change-overs and maintenance.\n\n?    Preventative maintenance is performed on all chlorine feed equipment, the chlorine container hoist, scales, chlorine monitors, and the exhaust fan. Preventative maintenance is tracked through a computerized maintenance management software program (HACH JobCal). \n\n?    The 2-ton chlorine hoist is inspected annually by a qualified third-party inspector and inspection results are filed onsite.\n\n?    The water treatment plant is a secure facility with barbed wire fence around the perimeter and multiple security cameras throughout the facility including the chlorine feed/storage room. All exterior doors have card access security controls in place. The chlorine room is secured at all times and has a warning sign reading \"Poisonous gas - Authorized Personnel Only.\" \n\n?    The chlorine gas detectors go through self-tests daily. In the event of a chlorine gas leak, automated audible and visual alarms (outside of the chlorine room and at the exhaust vent) activate and alert personnel to a leak. The plant's SCADA system and auto-dialer also go into alarm. In the event of a major chlorine gas leak, the emergency siren is to be activated by plant personnel.\n\n\n\n4.    The five-year accident history.\n\nBy definition, there have been no report"

The emergency response program.\n\nUte Water employees attend monthly LEPC meetings and our emergency response program has been discussed with LEPC members including personnel from both the Palisade Fire Department and the Grand Junction Fire Department. Although several treatment plant staff have received OSHA 40-hr HAZWOPER training, the Grand Junction Fire Department HAZMAT team is the Designated Emergency Response Authority and would ultimately take command of any uncontained gas chlorine leaks. Per recent amendments to the Clean Air Act, treatment plant staff will coordinate annually with emergency responders, which was last done formally as a tour of the facility in January of 2016. \n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThere are no future plans for upgrades to our chlorine feed or storage equipment.\n\n"
