To comply with the requirements in 40\nCFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF FORT WORTH\nWATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk Management Program\n(RMProgram) for the NHWTP including Management System, Hazard\nAssessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency\nResponse Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the employee and\npublic risk of injury, death or damage from accidental release of\nchemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Manager\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nD.   Safety Information Officer\nE.   Hazard Review Update Officer\nF.   Operation Manager/Assistant Operation Manager\nG.   Training Supervisor\nH.

Storage, transfer, and use of anhydrous ammonia in ammoniation\n     system\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in two (2) side-by-side\nidentical 5,000 gallons tanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine \ninventory in each tank is 50,000 lbs.  The maximum process quantity is \n100,000 lbs., ignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in two (2)\nside-by-side identical tanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid ammonia \ninventory in each tank is 85% of tank water volume of 2,000 gallons.  By\nassuming an ammonia density of 42.5 lb/ft3, the ammonia volume for one tank\nis converted to a mass of 9,700 lbs. with the exclusion of negligible \nquantities in the piping.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe NHWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.  Although it will not be the responsibility of the plant\nemployees to evacuate offsite areas, addresses and telephone numbers\nof major public receptors inside a one (1) mile radius are provided in\nthe plan.  The CFWWD will work closely with the Emergency Management\nOffice and document coordination activities and communications.\n\n\n6    ON-GOING AND UP-COMING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nTo improve the safety of regulated facilities at the VCWWTP, the\nfollowing plant expansion, process modification and facility upgrade\nprojects are under construction or are scheduled to begin soon:\n"
