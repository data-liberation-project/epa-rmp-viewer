Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAll personnel at Consolidated Natural Gas's Hastings Extraction Plant (HEP) are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, our regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  CNG has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, CNG  will contact the Wetzel County  Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local Volunteer Fire Departments (VFDs), law enforcement agencies and emergency medical services.\n\n    \n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Hastings Extraction Plant processes natural gas by cleaning and dehydrating it prior to introducing it to a refrigeration system where the heavier hydrocarbons are liquefied. The resulting product, natural gas liquid,  is then separated into its constituent parts which are marketable as fuels.    There are  8 regulated substances present at HEP.  These substances are, Propane, Butane, Pentane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Ethane, Ethylene  [Ethene], Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl] and Methane.  All of these substances except Ethylene [Ethene] ,  which is purchased and stored on site for use in the ethlene refrigeration system, are produced at HEP.    Propane, Butane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] are produced at Hastings Extraction Plant and transported by pipeline to storage for distribution to end users via tanker trucks and railroad tank cars.

Pentane and Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl] are the major components of natural gasoline which is produced at HEP and transported to storage by pipeline for distribution to end users via tanker trucks and barges.  Methane is the major component of natural gas and is distributed as such to end users via pipeline.    \n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at  HEP facility is 346,600.00 lb. while Butane, Pentane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Ethylene  [Ethene], Ethane, Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] and Methane are present at our facility in quantities of 177,800.00 lb., 171,600.00 lb., 909,00.00 lb., 38,000.00 lb., 20,800.00 lb., 1800.00 lb. and 500.00 lb. respectively. The maximum inventory of Propane, Butane, Isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] , Ethane, Isopentane [butane, 2-methy] , and Pentane are present as a mixture in either of the two identical NGL spheres where they are held prior to being introduced to the process for fractionation.  The maximum quantity of Ethylene [Ethene] is 38,000 lb.  stored in the 132-F Ethylene Storage Drum.   \n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from NGL Sphere #1 in the Hastings Extraction Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of 800000.00lb. of natural gas liquid containing the regulated substances Ethan"

      "SummaryText": "e, Propane, Butane, Isobutane and Pentane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.76 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure.  The affected population within this area is approximately 320 people. \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from 132-F in the Hastings Extraction Plant.  Since all of our regulated substances would affect the public in the same way, we have determined to use as our alternative release a most likely scenario.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 500.00lb. of Ethylene  [Ethene] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.04 miles.  Since the nearest public receptor is .147 miles away from the Hastings Extraction Plant this release would not affect any receptors.  \n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  We also have an air operating permit ID pending under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHastings Extraction Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.
