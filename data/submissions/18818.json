It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.76 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure.  The affected population within this area is approximately 320 people. \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from 132-F in the Hastings Extraction Plant.  Since all of our regulated substances would affect the public in the same way, we have determined to use as our alternative release a most likely scenario.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 500.00lb. of Ethylene  [Ethene] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.04 miles.  Since the nearest public receptor is .147 miles away from the Hastings Extraction Plant this release would not affect any receptors.  \n\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

This commitment is demonstrated by our  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, our regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  CNG has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, CNG  will contact the Wetzel County  Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local Volunteer Fire Departments (VFDs), law enforcement agencies and emergency medical services.\n\n\t\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Hastings Extraction Plant processes natural gas by cleaning and dehydrating it prior to introducing it to a refrigeration system where the heavier hydrocarbons are liquefied. The resulting product, natural gas liquid,  is then separated into its constituent parts which are marketable as fuels.    There are  8 regulated substances present at HEP.  These substances are, Propane, Butane, Pentane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Ethane, Ethylene  [Ethene], Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl] and Methane.  All of these substances except Ethylene [Ethene] ,  which is purchased and stored on site for use in the ethlene refrigeration system, are produced at HEP.    Propane, Butane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] are produced at Hastings Extraction Plant and transported by pipeline to storage for distribution to end users via tanker trucks and railroad tank cars.
