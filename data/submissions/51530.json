Five-year accident history\n\nThe following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at the facility in which injury on site did occur:\n- We had an accidental release of 2.65 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on April 12, 1996.  One employee was contacted by the small amount and received emergency room treatment only.  \n- We had an accidental release of 2.65 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on October 5, 1998.
