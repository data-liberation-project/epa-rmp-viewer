The New Haven Terminal is an MTSA regulated, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of New Haven, CT. The Terminal handles and stores gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\r\n\r\nShell - New Haven Terminal in New Haven, CT is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Shell believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding EHS performance is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThe New Haven Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community. Shell promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Shell has designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\r\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\r\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\r\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\r\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the New Haven Terminal is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility. The butane blending process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances are identified."

The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations. In the event of an emergency involving the New Haven Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the New Haven Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire response capability. The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the New Haven Fire Department and New Haven Office of Emergency Management. The New Haven Fire Department regularly participates in training and exercise sessions for this Facility.\r\n\r\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nShell is continually striving to make the New Haven Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community. In an effort to improve and promote system safety, Shell looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. The New Haven Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additionally, Shell works cooperatively with the surrounding community to address any concerns."

      "SummaryText": "By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Shell - New Haven Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors/visitors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the New Haven Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in three (3) storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to an injection skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending/injection skid and auto analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and HMI, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the New Haven Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\r\nPREVENTION MEASURES\r\n\r\nShell's accidental release prevention programs along with emergency planning and response programs allow affective management of the hazards posed by Butane to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safe"

Shell and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Shell also employs specific prevention measures that are incorporated into the process operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures include:\r\n\r\n-Process engineered and constructed (as a minimum) in accordance with recognized industry and company standards.\r\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety/relief valves).\r\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams.\r\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators along with third party 24/7 remote monitoring.\r\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation.\r\n-Redundant control systems.\r\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\r\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices.\r\n-Limited facility access.\r\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs.\r\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspection"
