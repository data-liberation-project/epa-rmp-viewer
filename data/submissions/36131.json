SUMMARY   (40 CFR 68)\n\nThis document outlines the Risk Management Plan in place at the CHS Inc. Laurel, Montana Refinery.  This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (40 CFR part 68).\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PRACTICES   40 CFR 68.155(a)\n\nThe CHS Inc. Laurel, Montana Refinery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  Our practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES   40 CFR 68.155(b)\n\nThe CHS Inc. refinery, located at 802 Highway 212 South, Laurel, Montana, operates a v"

The refinery processes approximately 56,000 barrels of feed stocks per day through the operation of typical refining processes.  The CHS Inc. refinery receives and transports petroleum products via rail, trucks, and pipelines and has a storage capacity of petroleum and refined products exceeding three million barrels through a network consisting of nearly 80 above ground tanks.\n\nThe refinery has a number of streams regulated as flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity.  In addition, the refinery uses hydrogen fluoride, which is also a regulated substance, in a quantity above the threshold quantity.  \n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS    40 CFR 68.155(d)\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery.  Because the processes at the refinery are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation and OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nIt is part of  the CHS culture to ensure systems, procedures and people work together to prevent chemical releases from occurring.  In addition to many support functions, e.g., engineering, inspection and maintenance, CHS uses a layers of protection approach for preventing chemical and flammable releases so that an unlikely failure in one layer will not defeat the safeguards provided by another layer.  These layers are diverse and independent of each other and include the following:\n(1)  Equipment is designed and constructed using sound engineering practices.\n(2)  Control systems monitor equipment operation to keep it within normal limits.\n(3)  Alarms indicate when operations are outside normal limits and trained operator technicians make the proper response to correct the deviation.\n(4)  Instrument and mechanical protection devices prevent excessive equipment temperature or p"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation policy that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information (CHS Inc. policy: PSM_II_1 - 8)\nCHS Inc. keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented sa"

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous mechanical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (CHS Inc. policy: PSM_III_1)\nCHS Inc. has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nCHS Inc. primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis as well as the what if analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. Both analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assig"

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, CHS Inc. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures (CHS Inc. policy: PSM_V_1)\nCHS Inc. maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, CHS Inc. maintains as part of the operating procedures, documentation that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining (CHS Inc. policy: PS"

      "SummaryText": "M_V_1)\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, CHS Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors (CHS Inc. policy: PSM_VI_1)\nCHS Inc. uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, CHS evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safe"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. CHS Inc. incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices (CHS Inc. policy: PSM_IX_1-6)\nCHS Inc. has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change  (CHS Inc. policy: PSM_VIII_1)\nCHS Inc. has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation\u00bfs.\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, CHS Inc. periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.
