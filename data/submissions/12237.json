      "SummaryText": "1. The Faciliy Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Agricultural Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. 2.  Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distrtibuted for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 209,600# in our two tanks, which are 30,000 and 18,000 vessels. The maximum quantity handled whoud be the unloading of a semi truck with the capacity of approximately 42,000#.  3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 30,000 gal tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,000 #, which represents the volume of the 30,000 gal. storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.4 miles. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .7 miles. 4. The accidental release prevention Program:  The facility has implimented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  5.  The Five Year Accident History.  A: There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia that: have caused any deaths, injurie"

B: The following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have occurred at the facility and meet the above criteria: A delivery transport bled off liquid line after unolading into air causing temporary drift of ammonia vapor.  6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 DFR 1910.38; Has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). An A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29,DFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.  7. Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are perfodrmed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implimentation at this time.  For further information, contact Jim Arends, Manager.  4-18-99"
