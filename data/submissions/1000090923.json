      "SummaryText": "ConocoPhillips is committed to protecting the health and safety of everybody who plays a part in our operations, lives in the communities in which we operate or uses our products. \n\nWherever we operate, we will conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. \n\nWe will not be satisfied until we succeed in eliminating all injuries, occupational illness, unsafe practices and incidents of environmental harm from our activities.\n\n\n\nThe Lost Cabin Gas Plant is constructed in accordance with ASME code requirements, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility is operated and maintained in accordance with OSHA 1910.119 PSM and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 requirements. A written emergency response plan is in place which includes coordination and response by Fremont County Emergency Management, if required. \n\n\n\nThere are several active mitigation devices in place to minimize a potential release of hazardous chemical and flammables, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and propane. The Lost Cabin Gas Plant removes carbon dioxide (CO2), Sulfur compounds, H2S and water from the raw inlet feed gas from 8 gas wells to meet pipeline specifications for product sales (natural gas). \n\n\n\nThe raw gas is cooled and contacted with a solvent to remove contaminates (CO2 & H2S) in each of the two gas processing trains (train 2 and train 3). The plant is considered a RMP Program Level 3 for H2S and propane. The propane refrigeration system is utilized in each train to cool the solvent to improve its performance. Each of the propane refrigeration systems is equipped with compressors, exchangers, piping, valves and a receiver tank that contains approximately 50,000 pounds of propane stored as liquid under pressure. \n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of consequence to date for the RMP Program 3 processes at the Lost Cabin Gas Plant.\n\n"
