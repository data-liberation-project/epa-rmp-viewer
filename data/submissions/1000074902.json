As a general policy, an uncontrolled release will be allowed to continue until the leaking container is emptied (under close supervision of first responders) as long as the released chlorine gas is actively removed by the chlorine gas scrubber.  If the chlorine gas leak cannot be not mitigated by the chlorine scrubber, the Incident Commander and Emergency Responders will begin community notifications/evaluations and determine if corrective action will be taken to mitigate the leak.    \r\n\r\nControllable releases may be repaired by RMWTP operators (with support by Fire Department staff) if the repair work is deemed safe by the Incident Commander.  The following criteria are used to determine the appropriate response actions:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIf the chlorine level in the storage area is not detectable on the chlorine sensor, operations staff may be allowed entry to the chlorine storage area to make repairs.  Emergency \r\nresponders will serve as attendants during the repair or until the area is determined safe to work in by the Incident"

In general, the operation staff's response to any uncontrolled chlorine release is to immediately alert emergency First Responders and to evacuate the site.  RMWTP operators are trained in the safe use of SCBA and personal protective equipment, but mitigation of an uncontrolled chlorine gas leak will be deferred to the City of Glenwood Springs Fire Department.  RMWTP operators may respond to a controllable chlorine gas leak only if there is more than one trained operator on site and emergency responders are notified of the corrective work.   \r\n\r\n2.7\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe City of Glenwood Springs plans to eliminate the gaseous chlorine feed system in the near-term.  It will be replaced with an on-site sodium hypochlorite feed system.  Design of the sodium hypochlorite feed system is anticipated to begin in late-2018.  Construction is anticipated for late- 2019 or early-2020."
