Davis Wire's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb.\tThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address the handling of the following regulated substances at the Davis Wire facility located at 31775 Hayman Street, Hayward, CA 94544:-\n\n\t-  Propane\n\t-  Anhydrous ammonia\n\t-  Hydrochloric acid (40%)\n\nd.\tThe worst case flammable release scenario modeled was the release of the entire contents of the propane storage vessel in 10 minutes. The alternate flammable release modeled was the release of propane liquid from a severed fill hose or line. The worst case toxic release scenario was determined to be the release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage vessel in 10 minutes. The alternate ammonia release modeled involved release from a damaged hose or line. The alternate release of hydrochloric acid involved a liquid spill.  All scenarios have endpoints which extend offsite. No credit was taken for measures to prevent or mitigate any releases except for the passive mitigation provided for hydrochloric acid by containment berms.\n\ne.\tDavis Wire has developed a comprehensive release prevention program. Physical safeguards to prevent a release of a regulated substance include monitoring, alarm and shutdown systems. Procedural and other safeguards are also used.\n\nf.\tThere have been no accidents at this facility which meet the criteria for inclusion in the Five-year Accident History component of the Risk Management Plan.\n\ng.\tDavis Wire has a comprehensive emergency response program in place to provide prompt but safe response to halt and/or mitigate a release. Davis Wire has worked closely with the Hayward Fire Department ("
