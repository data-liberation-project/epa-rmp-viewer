      "SummaryText": "The Lewiston - Auburn Water Pollution Control Authority is re-submitting this Risk Management Plan in compliance with Federal Regulations for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR 68).  The Authority is subject to the rule due to our use of one ton chlorine gas cylanders for disinfection of plant effluent and for process control (destruction of filamentous organisms).  The Authority also utilizes a number of other chemical that require special handling for safe use including sodium bisulfite (for effluent dechlorination) calcium oxide (quickline) and organic polymers (for sludge dewaering and conditioning). We do not believe that these other chemicals need to be included in this plan.  The Authority has used chlorine gas for the purposes described above for over 30 years without an offite incident.  In fact the few releases that the Authority has experienced have all been relatively minor.  Never the less the incidents experienced over the last 5 years are documentedin section six of this report.  In the one instance where an employee was exposed to a small puff of chlorine gas, he was released for the remainder of the day, went to the hospital for evaluation an returned to work on the following day.  It is believed that the maximum exposure of chlorine was approximately 4 ppm, or roughly 1/10th of the IDLH level.  It was determined that the relase was well below the 10 pound FERC level. The Authority's chlorine delivery system is an all vacuum system with the exception of the whips that connect the cylanders to the chlorinators and the chlorine cylanders themselves.  Both chlorine and dechlorination are flow paced and computer controlled.  A number of locations in the facility are monitored for chlorine gas, notably the scale room where cylanders containing chlorine are stored and in the \"pipe tunnel\" which represents the lowest level in the vacinity of the chlorine system piping.  Many of these safety features were added with a treatment plant upgrade in 1997.  Bec"

      "SummaryText": "ause the system is now essentially an all vacuum system, it is intrinsically safe.  In the case of a break in the chorine gas piping, the vacuum in the system would be lost causing a shut down of the chlorinator.    Traditionally, all of the Authority's employees with the exception of the administrative assistant have been trained in chlorine safety and repair of chlorine cylanders.  This responsibility has now shifted to the Lewiston - Auburn Special Operations Team.  This team is made up of members who have been specially trained in all relevant hazardous materials incident proceedures, have had the requisite physical examinations, and have the necessary support personnel to establish hot and cold zones, communicate with local officails and the press.  The Authority's own employees (excluding those who are members of the special operations team)  are responsible for minor repairs, and level one events only.  Level one events being those in which less than the reportable ammount of chlorine is released and the release is easily contained.  The Authority is confident that its operations, training and emergency proceedures are protective of the environment and the public.  As we conitue into the future the Authority will continue to work to assure the highest levels of protection to the people residing in the vacinity of our facility."
