The site has a nurse and employees trained at the first responder level of care\n\nThe outstanding safety programs at the Ottawa facility have earned the site OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR status, presented by OSHA for exemplary safety management. This is OSHA's highest recognition for safety performance. \n\nIn addition, the following specific prevention programs are in place:\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe employees and management work together to manage process safety and accident prevention efforts. Employees participate in process hazard reviews and in the development of operating procedures. They assist in updating and verifying technical documents and chemical information. Employees have access to all information created as part of this facility's accident prevention program. Employees are involved in developing and carrying out training, incident investigations, management of change, process hazard analyses and pre-startup safety reviews.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTechnical information on process equipment, technology, and chemicals are maintained and used to ensure safe operation of the covered processes. These documents address chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for critical process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design and configuration details. Specific departments are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS\u0092). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and other known hazards associated with inadvertently mixing of chemicals. For specific covered process areas, there are documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperatures, pressures). Operators ensure that the process is maintained within these limits using"

Technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment are maintained digitally within the Ottawa plant's intranet. Hard copy back up of key critical information is maintained by Operations, EHSS, and Engineering. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Off-Site Consequence Analysis\nThe Ottawa Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards and risks associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each new and altered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Methodologies used to perform these evaluations include the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) and layer of protection analysis (LOPA). These analyses are conducted using cross-functional teams with operations and engineering expertise. Team members identify and evaluate hazard scenarios, ranking each scenario's risk level with respect to event likelihood and severity. The team also evaluates prevention and mitigation measures and makes appropriate recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures if they are judged necessary. The site management team reviews the PHA team's findings and recommendations. The management team establishes priorities for implementation of PHA recommendations based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the team. This"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. The Ottawa Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis studies using experience gained to improve process safety. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for covered processes and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. Findings and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. Recommendations made by the team updating or revalidating the PHA are again reviewed and resolved by management review with final resolution being documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Ottawa plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following maintenance activities or following an emergency shutdown. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and a training resource in training new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and verified as current and accurate. Operating procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. When creating or reviewing operating procedures, a team of personnel review and comment on the draft\u0092s accuracy and completeness. Procedures are available to operators and other personnel in work areas where process operations are performed.\n\nTraining\nTraining is an essential part of the skills development program used for qualifying employees involved in operating a process.

Following classroom orientation, the new employee begins coworker training with an experienced operator and a review of operating procedures applicable to their job. At the conclusion of this co-worker-training period, the new employee is evaluated to ensure they possesses the skills and knowledge necessary to safely do their job. To supplement and reinforce job knowledge and skills, all employees undergo refresher training at regular intervals. Refresher training frequency ranges from each year to once every three years. Training is documented and understanding is verified using oral and written tests, performance observation and other means that objectively demonstrate understanding.\n\nContractor Safety Program\nThe Ottawa Plant employs contractors to perform special construction projects or supplement the maintenance workforce when needed. All contractors receive orientation training depending on the scope, nature, and location of their work. Contractors\u0092 selection considers the existence and effectiveness of their safety programs and performance. Contractors undergo orientations where they are made aware of basic plant rules and safety policies, workplace hazards in the area they will work, safe work practices applicable to the jobs, and basic emergency response procedures. During this initial orientation, contract employees are instructed to report any hazards their work may create or that they discover during the course of their work. Contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Start-up Safety Reviews\nThe Ottawa Plant personnel perform pre-startup safety reviews for facility modifications beyond replacements of equipment in kind on covered processes.

The basic aspects of the program include: (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training in (1) overviews of the process and its hazards, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner. Equipment deficiencies, once identified, are corrected prior to further operation of the equipment, or a management team will determine and prescribe how the equipment may continue safely in operation. As part of the mechanical integrity program, quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Ottawa Plant employs widely accepted safety work practices and incorporates ten (10) Life Saving Rules into these Life Critical Proc"

The management of change program uses a qualitative risk assessment to determine the significance of the change. This risk level assessment determines the levels of authorization required to approve the action. Design review checklists are used to evaluate different types of changes to prevent new hazards being created or equipment changes which are not suited to the service as it exists in the process. Another feature of the management of change program is that it verifies and documents that procedures, records, and equipment information are updated and that personnel affected by the change are informed of and trained in the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAll incidents that result in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a release of a hazardous material, a fire or explosion in a covered process area, major property damage, offsite consequences, adverse environmental impact, or serious personal injury be reported and promptly investigated. By investigating accidents and near misses, important lessons are learned. Corrective actions can then be implemented to prevent similar events in the future.

An audit team reviews records and documents to determine the degree of program compliance. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Audit team findings are documented and presented to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to audit findings are tracked until they are complete. The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe SABIC plant is located on a 215-acre tract along the Illinois River about three miles east of Ottawa, IL. It was built in 1967 and currently employs about 210 people. The plant manufactures engineered thermoplastic resins and pellets. The site products are used in the automotive, medical, electronics, computer, and appliance industries, to name a few. \n\nThe Ottawa, IL plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule: acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance, and 1,3-butadiene, a regulated flammable substance. Acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene are raw materials used to manufacture products. The facility\u0092s covered processes are regulated under Level 3 RMP requirements. The acrylonitrile and 1,3-Butadiene processes are subject to Level 3 RMP requirements as they are categorized under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) listed in Section 68.10i of the RMP regulation (NAICS 325211). The 1,3-Butadiene processes containing more than 10,000 lbs are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n \n4.
