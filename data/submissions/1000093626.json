We create alternative solutions for delivery and assist customers in creating new offerings across many markets.  Our traditional focus has been on the sale, delivery and safe handling of bulk chemicals.  Today, Hawkins is becoming more specialized by working with customers with very exacting specifications seeking appropriate and innovative alternatives to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nHawkins is based in Roseville, Minnesota with branches throughout the United States.  The Hawkins Water Treatment Group (HWTG) provides water and waste-water treatment equipment and chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.  Hawkins also serves regional customers in the Industrial sector in the fields of energy, electronics, chemical processing, pulp and paper, medical devices and metal finishing.  Food manufacturers, processing plants, and pharmaceutical concerns across the nation benefit from Hawkins' chemical distribution, blending and related expertise.\r\n\r\nHawkins acquired American Development corporation of Tennessee (ADC) in July 2020.  At that time, this facility did not have chemicals on site that triggered an RMP or PSM.  ADC started business in 1996 with a focus on serving municipality water treatment needs but did not handle chlorine.  Hawkins decided to expand the chemicals at this site in May 2021 by bringing in chlorine 150-pound cylinders to match the business model of the other Hawkins Water Treatment Group facilities.\r\n\r\nHawkins' mission is to exceed our customers' expectations as a high-quality, service-oriented chemical supplier.  We adapt quickly to the changing chemical needs of customers with a keen focus on technical expertise, teamwork, safety, profitability, and responsible care of the environment and of our community.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary \r\nPrevention and Emergenc"
