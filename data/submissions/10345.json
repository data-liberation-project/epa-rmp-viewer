THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n         THE OWNERS,MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF MEADOWLAND FARMERS COOP ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR,THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n         THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY\n\n         ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION .ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. PROPANE GAS IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS USES.\n                                                                                                                         \n        THE  MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 220000 POUNDS IN OUR       \n26000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TANKS.THE MAXIMUM  QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n         THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 45000 POUNDS IN OUR 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n         A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 120000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME  OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM)  IS .5"

ACCORDING THE EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .30 MILES.\n\n       B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 2 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS ..56 MILES.\n\n       THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED 85 PERCENT OF CAPACITY (45,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION, CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE.  ACCORDING THE EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS  .2 MILES.  \n\n4.
