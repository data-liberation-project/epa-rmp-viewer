Our corporate safety policy provides guidance for implementation, operation and review of the standards that govern the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems that use anhydrous ammonia or any other highly hazardous chemical that are defined by the threshold planning quantities of the Federal and/or State standard. This includes any of the operational facilities that manufacture, store and distribute product in the company. \n\n\n\nThe personal health and safety of each employee is our first concern and top priority.  Management will provide a safe and healthy workplace to the greatest degree possible.  Our efforts for personal safety and health shall be in keeping with the highest standards.  To accomplish this, management will provide all reasonable safeguards to ensure safe working conditions.\n\n\n\nIn keeping with our high standards of safety, Saputo Dairy Foods, USA, Sulphur Springs is an OSHA VPP Star facility.\n\n\n\nThe Sulphur Springs facility is located in Northeast Texas.  The facility employs approximately 300 full-time associates.  Our primary products include extended shelf dairy and non-dairy food products.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility.  The refrigeration system is used for processing and cold storage of dairy food products.   \n\n\n\nThe Sulphur Springs facility falls under OSHA's PSM regulations.  In addition to our PSM program, we have audits by a refrigeration contractor.  We are actively training our maintenance technicians.

The Sulphur Springs Plant has only experienced one small incident involving the release of Ammonia in the past five years. Total estimated loss volume was 45-50#'s as estimated by our HVAC contractor.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program consists of training for the associates, rapid communication, and mitigation.  All associates are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety.  Our emergency response plans are filed and reviewed by OSHA.  The general procedure is as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Problem recoginition and location.\n\n2. If the situation is deemed to be serious, then the plant fire alarm system is   activated which automaticallly notifies the fire department.  \n\n3. Immediately initiate plant emergency action plan and evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIt is the intent of the facility to continuously improve the proficiency in emergency response by training all employees on visual inspection as well as odor recognition. The ER/EAP is under the control of the Plant Safety Manager who develops and trains the program. \n\n\n\nThe process safety management policy of Saputo Dairy Foods, USA, is as follows: Identify, evaluate and continually improve on processes that effect the ability to prevent and mitigate the risk of release of acutely hazardous materials at each facility. We will communicate effectively to management, effected employees and the community the necessary awareness and preparation for the response to any potential events based on the probability of the risk.  Next, we will integrate all potentially compatible safety requirements and guidelines that are expected and implied for use at all company facilities and that enhance the capability of this system.
