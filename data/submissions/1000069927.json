These flammables are present in the inlet natural gas, recovered liquid hydrocarbon product, and the plant process refrigeration system There are no toxic compounds subject to the Risk Management Plan regulation present at the facility.  Stabilized field liquid condensate is also stored at the facility prior to shipment, but this liquid has a low vapor pressure and is exempt from the Risk Management Plan regulation.  The inlet gas and field condensate are naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures and are exempt from the RMP regulation.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant located in Lincoln County, Wyoming, is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, L.L.C.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant is an integrated gas processing, hydrocarbon liquid recovery and residue gas delivery facility.  The plant is designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components and some individual foundation mounted equipment.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from gas gathering systems and inlet gas pipelines.  The gas passes through inlet slug catching facilities where liquids that condense in the gas gathering systems are separated and stabilized.  The gas from the slug catchers is processed utilizing a turbo expander based cryogenic process to remove recoverable natural gas liquids.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.  \r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity."

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Pioneer Cryogenic Plant is coordinated with the Lincoln County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Pioneer Cryogenic Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \r\n  \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations."

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.
