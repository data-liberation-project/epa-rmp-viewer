Chemical storage areas and process equipment are regularly inspected, repaired and upgraded to prevent accidental releases. Should an accidental release occur, response activities will be coordinated through the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. On-site personnel are trained to make minor repairs and to contain small accidental releases.\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, treats the water and supplies the water to a portion of JXN Water of Jackson. The plant uses chlorine gas mixed in water with anhydrous ammonia gas to disinfect the water. The chlorine gas is stored in 10 one-ton cylinders. At a given time, 5 of the cylinders are connected on a single header. The ammonia gas is stored in two 10,000-gallon above ground tanks.\nCoordinates for the chemical storage locations at the plants were computed using EPA\u0092s downloadable Marplot tool referenced in Figures 1-1 through 1-4.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA mandates that the Worst-Case Release Scenarios have a release of the entire contents of the largest single container of each regulated substance during a 10-minute period with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an F atmospheric stability class. \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 distances for releases were developed using the EPA\u0092s modeling software ALOHA version 5.4.7 while referencing tables listed in EPA\u0092s \u0093RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\u0094 The population affected by releases was computed using the EPA\u0092s and NOAA\u0092s Marplot 5.1.1 software which contains the year 2010 census data. EPA requires that a circle with a radius equal to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 be used to determine the area adversely affected by a re"

      "SummaryText": "lease. EPA does not allow the circle to be modified to compensate for prevailing wind conditions or terrain effects, which would greatly reduce populated areas adversely affected by a release. For a 1-ton release of chlorine gas, the distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 as modeled is 1.73 miles, affecting approximately 11,226 residents and nearby major commercial areas of Jackson and Ridgeland, MS, the recreational area along the Pearl River, the Ross Barnett Reservoir. The 10,000-gallon ammonia tanks are limited to being filled to 85% of capacity due to the policy of ammonia suppliers used by JXN Water, reducing the effective capacity of each tank to 8,500 gallons. For an 8,500-gallon release of ammonia gas, the distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 is 2.56 miles, which includes areas in Jackson, Ridgeland, Madison, and Flowood, Mississippi affecting approximately 28,566 residents and nearby schools, major commercial areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River, the Ross Barnett Reservoir, and the Natchez Trace Parkway.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs determined by ALOHA an atmospheric stability class of C was used since it matched Jackson\u0092s average weather parameters of temperature (83.7\u00b0F for August), humidity (74%), and wind speed (3.0 m/s). Chlorine gas was modeled as released through a 0.375? diameter hole in the supply piping with a valve that failed to close automatically for 1 cylinder was assumed. This produced a distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 of 1.16 miles, affecting approximately 5,700 residents, major commercial areas, the southwest corner of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, and the recreational area of The Country Club of Jackson. The release scenario for ammonia storage assumed the release of the contents of a storage tank, producing a distance to the \u0093Toxic Endpoint\u0094 of 1.09 miles, affecting approximately 4,847 residents, major commercial areas, the southwest corner of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, and the recreational area of The Country Club of Jackson"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe plant is manned 24 hours each day including holidays with at least two operators. These operators inspect the chlorine and ammonia systems at least twice each shift. The chlorine system has area gas monitors which trigger flashing lights and an audible alarm on the main plant computer in the Operations Room. The ammonia system has an area gas monitor in the Ammoniator Room which triggers a flashing light and an audible alarm in the building. The ammonia system also has high-pressure and low-pressure alarms which produce an audible alarm on the plant computer. Maintenance personnel are immediately called in to stop small releases. The operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia equipment are performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u0092s instructions. Operations and maintenance personnel receive regular training in the use and maintenance of the equipment through monthly safety meetings, seminars provided by the equipment manufacturers and formal classes provided through the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators Association and other training providers.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, the plant has not had any releases of chlorine or ammonia which resulted in death, injury, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant has developed an emergency response program. Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City of Jackson\u0092s, City of Ridgeland\u0092s, City of Madison\u0092s, and City of Flowood\u0092s Fire and Police Departments, and Hinds County\u0092s, Rankin County\u0092s, and Madison County\u0092s Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs). Through discussions during monthly safety meetings, formal training, and quarterly emerge"
