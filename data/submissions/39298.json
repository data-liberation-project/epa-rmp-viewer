      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAt our power plants, we handle isobutane, isopentane and pentane which are considered hazardous flammables by the US EPA. The same properties that make these regulated substances valuable as a working fluid for the power plants also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure,  to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our facility staff personnel, and to reduce the threat to our community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these regulated substances combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of these facilities combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nSince our operators do not respond to large chemical releases, we have implemented an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for handling small releases of hazardous chemicals as required by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n2.  Facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe purpose of our operation is to generate electricity by utilizing the geothermal resource as a source of energy. Our facilities are located nine miles south of Reno, Nevada and includes for power plants designated as SB1, SB1A, SB2 and SB3. The SB1 and SB1A power plants are co-located at the northwest corner of the site and use the regulated substances pentane and isopentane, respectively, as the working fluids. The SB2 and SB3 power plants are located in the northwest corner of the site and both use the regulated substance isobutane as the working fluid. We have identified these plants as a single process.\n\n- Geothermal Energy and Power Plants\nGeothermal energy is renewable heat energy from the earths core. Geothermal reservoirs of hot water or steam are tapped with wells and their heat is converted to electricit"

      "SummaryText": "y. At the Steamboat Power Plants, geothermal brine at a temperature of 300\u00b0-315\u00b0 F is pumped from production wells drilled into the geothermal reservoir. The brine is kept under pressure to keep it from flashing to steam as it is piped through the plant to the heat exchangers where the heat is extracted from the brine and is used to heat a working fluid (isobutane, isopentane, or pentane) to a vapor. The used brine is injected back into the geothermal reservoir keeping the cycle closed. The vapor is piped through the blades of a turbine, spinning the turbine which is connected to a generator and produces electricity. The hot vapor is piped through air-cooled condensers, transforming it back to a fluid. The fluid is cycled back to the heat exchangers in a closed-loop system and the process starts again.\n\n-  SB1 & SB1A Overview\nThe SB1 and SB1A Power Plants were developed by Ormat, Inc in 1984 and 1987, respectively. Collectively, SB1 and SB1A produce approximately 7 megawatts (gross) of electricity daily and sell the power to Sierra Pacific Power Company.\n\nSB1 uses approximately 85,000 pounds of pentane and SB1A uses approximately 25,000 pounds of isopentane within their closed-loop systems.\n\n-  SB2 & SB3 Overview\nThe SB2 and SB3 Power Plants were developed by Steamboat Development Corporation in 1992. In February 2004 Ormat Nevada, Inc assumed the operation of these two plants, while retaining the entire operations, maintenance and management staff. Collectively, SB2 and SB3 produce approximately 40 megawatts (gross) of electricity daily and sell the power to Sierra Pacific Power Company under a 30 year power purchase agreement.\n\nTogether, the plants use about 660,000pounds of isobutane as the working fluid within their closed-loop systems.\n\n3.  General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses primarily upon the proper training and actions of our operators as outlined by OSHA's  Process S"

      "SummaryText": "afety Management (PSM), EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP), and NDEP's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP). The Training Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Incident Investigation Program, and Management of Change Program ensure that the operator is aware of all potential hazards as well as the measures to mitigate them. \n\nThe Preventive Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity Program is essential in maintaining the integrity of the equipment. Monthly emission  inspections for leaks, at all valve packing and piping flanges, and the proper operation of equipment also play a critical role in our prevention program.\n\nIn addition the Accidental Release Prevention Program relies upon safeguards inherent to the design of the power plant. Such safeguards include gas sensors and alarms, relief valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, vents, and check valves. \n\nIn the event of a fire, the plants are equipped with a sprinkler system, deluge system, fire monitors and hydrants.\n\n4.  Five Year Incident History:\n\nWe have had no accidental isobutane, isopentane or pentane releases in the last five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n5.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur plants have been operating safely for many years, we will continue to ensure extensive training is provided to are operators as they are essential to plant safety. \n\nIn addition we will evaluate any new mitigation or control technology that may improve safety at the Steamboat Facilities. \n\nLastly, we plan on making enhancements to our Preventive Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity Program that will continue to ensure that all equipment is operating safely and efficiently."
