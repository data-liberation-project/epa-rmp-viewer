      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe North Topeka Wastewater Treatment Plant (North Topeka WWTP), located at 1600 Button Road in Topeka, Kansas, prevents accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide by training and adhering to industrial and applicable codes and implementing good engineering practices. North Topeka WWTP's prevention program, safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation procedures are continuously updated. Every employee of the North Topeka WWTP is trained to be aware of the potential for chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases and distrubance of the systems.\n\nIn an emergency, the North Topeka WWTP's first consideration is the safety of personnel and the community. The second consideration is the protection of property, equipment, and the facility. The North Topeka WWTP maintains emergency response procedures that allow North Topeka WWTP personnel and the local fire department to respond to releases. The North Topeka WWTP has a HazMat Response Team that can assist the fire department and provide operational support as required. If required, the fire department coordinates the emergency response with other local emergency response organizations per the Emergency Action and Response Plan.\n\nAll employees are trained to recognize releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide and to activate the emergency response procedures as required. The HazMat Response Team receives additional training to enable them to respond to releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe North Topeka WWTP: Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide\nThe plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide to disinfect wastewater effluent. The North Topeka WWTP has the capacity to store 60,000 pounds of chlorine and 10,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. Since these quantities exceed the Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds for toxic substances, they must be addressed in the RMP. The North Topeka WWTP does no"

The hazard review team consisted of plant management, process operation and maintenance personnel, and consulting process design engineers. The team analyzed the hazards associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes using the what-if-technique. The hazard review team documented recommendations and set a schedule for implementation.\n\nThe North Topeka WWTP has adopted written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. The North Topeka WWTP Operations and Maintenance Manual provides procedures for operating scenarios including equipment startup, normal operations, normal and emergency shutdown, inspections, trouble-shooting trees, temporary operation, restartup, and consequences of deviation.\n\nThe North Topeka WWTP has a training program with guidelines for conducting regular, structured plant training for employees, including operators and maintenance personnel.

The North Topeka WWTP uses a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to schedule, track, and document preventative and corrective maintenance activitites. The CMMS infrastructure management system is a work order based system that generates work orders for preventive and corrective maintenance activities, and allows for organization and documentation of inventory, labor, materials, equipment, and contract management expenses.\n\nThe compliance audit process will be performed at least once every three years to ensure that the RMP procedures and practices are adequate and being followed. To complete a compliance audit, the North Topeka WWTP must demonstrate that documentation, employees' knowledge (interviews), and the physical faciltiy (thorough inspection) comply with 40 CFR part 68.\n\nThe RMP incident investigation program outlines the RMP investigation process. If the chlorine or sulfur dioxide incident is reportable, the employee completes an Incident Report form. An Incident Investigation Team investigates how the incident occurred and determines whether errors can be corrected by instituting safeguards for the process or whether employees need additional training. The Supervisor of Plant Operations and Maintenance - on the advice of the Incident Investigations Team - will promptly implement corrective actions. This information will be entered on the RMP Incident Report Form and Summary and signed by the Supervisor of Plant Operations and Maintenance.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\nThe five-year accident history must include releases from regulated processes that resulted in death, injuries, damage on site; or known offisite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.

The Water Pollution Control Division has a HazMat Response Team to respond to releases or potential releases of hazardous substances for the purpose of stopping the release. This team approaches the point of release to plug, patch, or otherwise stop the release of the hazardous substance.\n\nIn case of an emergency, the local fire department would be notified, followed by members of the Water Pollution Control Division Hazmat Response Team. The fire department would assume the responsibility of the Incident Command System and provide the Incident Control Commander. Members of the Hazmat Response Team would function under the Incident Control Commander and provide the operational support. Notification procedures are outlined in the Emergency Action and Response Plan and will be initiated by the Incident Control Commander. After initial site assessment, the Control Commander would notify and coordinate emergency response with other local emergency response organizations such as the police department and the Shawnee County Department of Emergency Management if necessary. These organizations would also notify the public, if necessary. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe North Topeka WWTP will continue to look at changes to improve the process dealing with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. Possible changes will be discussed on a regular basis."
