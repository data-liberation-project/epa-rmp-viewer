      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction / Background\n\nHolston Army Ammunition Plant (HSAAP), located on two sites in Kingsport, Tennessee, is a federal government owned, contractor operated facility. It was built in 1942 to produce RDX (cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine) and HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) based explosives for the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) of the United States Army. In 1999, BAE SYSTEMS Ordnance Systems Inc. (OSI) became the operating contractor. While continuing to produce RDX and HMX based explosives, HSAAP has been developing newer insensitive munitions to assist the Department of Defense in meeting its requirement to provide safer products to US military personnel. Insensitive munitions are less likely to detonate during handling when exposed to unexpected conditions such as heat, shock, and impact.\nHSAAP has had an excellent safety record over the past 82 years and strives to maintain this outstanding record. HSAAP maintains an on-site emergency response team and has long standing agreements and coordination with local emergency planning units including Sullivan and Hawkins County LEPCs and the City of Kingsport.\n\nOSI's Safety & Health Policy is based on the concept of Total Employee Involvement. This concept recognizes that all personnel have a shared responsibility for safety of employees, contractors, visitors, and the community through the prevention of accidents, damage, or loss of chemicals. With this responsibility, employees are procedurally empowered to stop work and activities if safety is ever a concern. Employees participate in process hazard analyses, compliance audits, incident investigations, corrective actions, design reviews, start-up reviews, procedure approval and development, and all other safety aspects. In addition, senior management at HSAAP is committed to environmental stewardship, safety, and emergency preparedness. This commitment has been demonstrated through development and implementation of both an Environmental M"

OSI pursued and obtained ISO 45001 certification in August 2009 for its OH&S Management System and also still retains certification through surveillance and recertification audits. HSAAP has been identified as a Center of Excellence by third party auditors for these programs.\n\nThe Safety team sends out frequent workplace safety information encouraging safe practices through active employee communications. Incidents and near misses are investigated, and pertinent information is shared through safety alerts with all personnel to help prevent similar occurrences.\n\nHSAAP does meet the criteria to be a stationary source with RMP covered processes, using and storing RMP regulated substances. Manufacturing of RDX and HMX explosives requires the use of concentrated nitric acid and anhydrous ammonia; two listed substances under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. HSAAP has four tank farms storing strong nitric acid and two areas with anhydrous ammonia storage. A smaller anhydrous ammonia tank exists at the agile manufacturing facility with the storage quantity below the threshold yet is still included in the interconnected covered process. An even smaller anhydrous ammonia tank and a low concentration ammonium hydroxide tank are located at non-RMP-covered processes. Additionally, oleum, another listed substance under the RMP regulations, is stored in one tank at the agile manufacturing facility above the threshold quantity. The oleum is used as a dehydrating agent in the manufacturing process.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release & Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs\n\nHSAAP is subject to OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements for multiple processes with overlap for the RMP covered processes.

Elements of HSAAP's PSM include: process safety information management, process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, proper training, mechanical integrity checks, change management, Pre Start-up reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permitting, and contractor oversight.\n\nPersonnel are trained annually on emergency response and hazard communication. Other safety-related topics are assigned based on each employee's job duties. Training is very important at HSAAP. This is evident as third-party auditors have recognized HSAAP's training program as a best practice among similar facilities across the U.S. Standard operating procedures are reviewed annually for completeness with required updates every five years or when a process change occurs that affects the procedure. Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted for RMP or OSHA-covered new processes or changes to existing processes or on any other process deemed necessary by the Safety Manager. Revalidation of Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted every five years. Management of Change procedures are followed for changes to equipment or operating procedures.\n\nThe ammonia, nitric acid, and oleum areas utilize a variety of passive and active mitigation technologies to prevent accidental chemical releases including the following: dikes, deluge systems, detection monitoring, process control alarms, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, diversion capabilities, perimeter monitoring, and water curtains.

HSAAP has recently completed a project to reduce the quantity stored of one of the RMP chemicals, through a process similar to the safer technologies and alternatives analysis (STAA) requirements. HSAAP already uses third party audits and has yearly exercises with close coordination with local emergency responders. After these exercises, gaps, improvement suggestions, and action items are documented and tracked. Through employee empowerment, HSAAP meets most of the new employee participation requirements. HSAAP has formalized the root cause analysis and incident investigation process using methods and software comparable with new rule requirements. PHA checklists already include facility siting and natural disasters. HSAAP still must work to ensure full compliance with the new rule yet the facility is committed to accident prevention and fulfillment of all legal and other requirements.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\n\nProcess 1\n\nThe Acid Neutralization covered process is made up of anhydrous ammonia storage interconnected by piping with three storage tank areas supporting three raw material recovery processes and one byproduct neutralization area. This process includes one new smaller leased anhydrous ammonia storage tank, three legacy ammonia storage tanks (no longer connected or in use, awaiting final liquid removal), piping to all areas, two existing recovery area tanks, two new recovery area tanks, and three byproduct tanks. The ammonia storage area has perimeter ammonia detectors with associated alarms. The new ammonia tank is nearly 60% smaller than each of the three legacy tanks. This process no longer includes railcar transportation containers which historically did not meet the definition of incident to transportation and were therefore considered temporary storage. Currently, ammonia is shipped by truck and the container remains attached to the mo"

The ammonia tank area has a water deluge system tied to new ammonia detection and a dike. As noted in the OCA section this has reduced the potential offsite impacts and distance to toxic endpoints. Since the water deluge system is considered active mitigation, credit for reductions in OCA distances, with the modeling software used, could not be taken. This means the OCA modeled distances and associated risks, in an actual event, would likely be diminished.\n\nProcess 2\n\nThe Agile Manufacturing process includes storage tanks for anhydrous ammonia (below RMP thresholds), strong nitric acid, and oleum. These listed chemicals are stored in tank farms adjacent to and co-located with specialty product buildings which could potentially be impacted by or cause a release of these chemicals. Therefore, the entire building and tank farm is considered one covered process. The storage tanks all have dikes, level indication with alarms, and the ammonia tank has a wet suppression system tied to ammonia detectors. The storage quantities have not changed since the last submission.\n\nProcess 3\n\nProduction of Nitric Acid/Ammonium Nitrate Mixture - The ammonium nitrate is produced by introducing ammonia into strong nitric acid. The resulting mixture is used as a raw material in the manufacture of products elsewhere in the facility. This process uses both anhydrous ammonia and strong nitric acid. Nitric acid and ammonia are piped to two mix tanks at the ammonium nitrate building. These two tanks and piping are included with the adjacent nitric acid and ammonia storage areas to make-up this covered process. There are four nitric acid storage tanks with associated dikes with material delivered by railcar. The nitric acid railcar is considered temporary storage (not incident to transportation). This railcar is carefully monitored and stored at a secure location prior to unloading."

There has been a slight increase in nitric acid storage as noted in section 1.\n\nCurrently there are two legacy anhydrous ammonia tanks still containing material. After final commissioning of the new storage tanks, the legacy material is planned to be worked down through the process to safely empty the tanks. Once these are empty (over next few months) these tanks will be taken out of service. Three new smaller leased ammonia tanks were installed and very recently placed into service. These were installed to not only reduce storage capacity and lower potential offsite impact but to improve safety during unloading and vaporization. Each new ammonia tank is nearly 40% smaller than the largest legacy tank. This process also no longer receives railcar transportation containers which historically did not meet the definition of incident to transportation and were therefore considered temporary storage. \nCurrently, ammonia is shipped by truck and the container remains attached to the motive power.

Special consideration is made for incidents involving, strong nitric acid, ammonia, or oleum or from RMP covered processes. From these incidents, none meet the accidental release criteria outlined in 40 CFR 68.42(a) and as defined in 68.3 during the last 5 year period. All incidents are tracked in the facility\u0092s electronic Incident Report System. Incident investigations of relevant degree are conducted on all incidents. Root causes and corrective actions are documented and tracked in the facility\u0092s QSHE Action Log system. As discussed, the facility utilizes various methods for investigation and root cause techniques.

The Incident Command System (ICS) is a set of preplanned assignments and job subdivisions implemented to reduce confusion in handling the emergency. The priorities of the system are: (1) safety of employees and responders, (2) safety of others in and around the area, (3) scene stabilization, and (4) property and environmental conservation. All personnel required to respond to an emergency or remain at an emergency scene are considered emergency response personnel for the duration of the emergency. HSAAP has improved the emergency response plan by implementing area specific supplemental emergency response documents which provides operations specific guidance. HSAAP has a fully manned and trained onsite fire department with HAZMAT and capabilities for rapid response to all types of emergencies. \n\nHSAAP has many diked or aproned areas ensuring most spills are contained. This material can then be safely treated or properly disposed, while preventing further release. HSAAP also has active clean-up capabilities utilizing spill and vacuum trucks and pumping equipment. The ICS includes coordination with local emergency planning units including Sullivan County LEPCs and the City of Kingsport which also has advanced response capabilities. To support this relationship an annual emergency training chemical release specific drill is held in conjunction with onsite contract services employees and local emergency responders. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nHSAAP continues to strive to modernize the facility and to constantly improve health, safety, and security using the best available technology and work practices. As previously mentioned, HSAAP maintains certification with ISO 14001 and 45001 systems."

      "SummaryText": "HSAAP has reduced ammonia inventory through installation of smaller ammonia tanks. This alone has reduced potential offsite impacts from ammonia storage and delivery. This risk reduction is even greater, due to a wet suppression systems in use on all newly installed ammonia tanks. This wet suppression/water curtain system is triggered by perimeter ammonia detectors for rapid automated activation. These tanks are now also filled by tanker truck, with multiply safety systems being used during tank filling. This eliminates the need to bring an ammonia railcar on-site, which was the previous worst-case scenario for ammonia. \n\nThe nitric acid alternative releases only result in offsite impacts when the scenario includes release outside of the diked area. The tanks and transfer pumps all have dikes to provide passive mitigation. Some transfer lines and valves are near the edges of the dike areas. HSAAP plans to continually improve these systems through the dike management program used to review, monitor, and upgrade diked areas. \n\nCurrently the nitric acid railcars, temporary stored, do not meet the incident to transportation definition. These railcars are initially stored in a secure area, monitored, and moved to the unloading areas with spill pans as quickly as possible. Rather than transporting acid internally by truck, which creates potentially frequent increased risk potential for workers, the facility is planning on using the pipeline between processes 4 and 5. For process 4, efforts are underway to reduce the acid concentration utilized in the process. This may not affect the storage concentration but should improve safety and potentially decrease the amount of product used over time.\n\nHSAAP also plans to fully comply with the new Safer Communities by Chemical Accident Prevention rule and the currently proposed OSHA Emergency Response rule, when finalized and issued, meant to improve responder safety during accidents.
