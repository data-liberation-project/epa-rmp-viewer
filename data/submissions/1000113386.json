This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them. As a company, Midcoast follows a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\nEmployees who enter the Plant complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators\u0092 problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with Midcoast\u0092s recurring safety improvements. Regular audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that Midcoast sets.\n\nThe Plant, located in rural Gregg County, is one of many facilities operated by Midcoast. The Plant uses a cryogenic process to recover natural gas liquids (NGLs) from a rich natural gas stream. These liquids are fractionated to produce an ethane/propane product (EP mix) and a butane-plus product. These products, along with the residue gas, are transmitted by pipeline. The inlet gas enters a Gilmer and Paxton scrubber to remove entrained liquids. The liquid from the scrubber passes through to a low-pressure separator. As the liquids reach a pre-determined level, they are dumped to a low low-pressure separator. The low low-pressure separator pumps the liquids into the condensate tanks. Water is drained off to the water tank. Condensate is sent to one of two 400-bbl storage tanks. The inlet gas leaves the inlet scrubber and enters"

The demathanizer residue gas is either sold to customers as low-pressure gas or recompressed employing two turbine compressors and sold as high-pressure gas. The NGLs separated in the cryogenic/turboexpander/demethanized process are fed into a liquid-liquid treater and are treated for Carbon Dioxide (CO2) removal with diethanolamine (DEA). The NGLs are sent to the fractionation process where the EP mix is separated from the butane and heavier species. The butane-plus stream is sent to two 30,000-gallon pressurized storage tanks, then to a pipeline. The EP mix is then sent out by pipeline. Two flammable mixtures are reported as present at the Plant in greater than threshold quantities: Butane-plus and NGLs (or demethanized raw feed). There are no toxic substances present at the Plant in greater than threshold quantities. Multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate, and fuel tanks (and associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors) are present to support the processing plant. As such, the Plant is classified as Program Level 3 RMP, under the regulation. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about Midcoast\u0092s operations at the Plant, Midcoast\u0092s programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, Midcoast\u0092s emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, Midcoast\u0092s five-year accident history, and Midcoast\u0092s planned changes to improve safety at the Plant.\n\nPrevention Program \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Plant. Because the processes at the Plant are regulated by the EPA\u0092s RMP and are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements an"

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. The Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response training, First Aid, etc.). \n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). Process safety information is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures:  The Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors:  The Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations."

      "SummaryText": "Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Midcoast conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one (1) additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity:  The Plant has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner. Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or Plant management will review the use of the equipment and determine"

The Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices:  The Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):  The Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation:  The Plant promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u0092s finding are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two (2) most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred at the Plant within the last five (5) years.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the NGL extraction, handling, and storage operations, the ERP will be followed. The overall emergency response program, including specifics of the ERP are linked with the Gregg County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan. Activation of this District Emergency Response Plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly. The 911 call is channeled through the Gregg County Sheriff\u0092s Department. All agencies and personnel respond to pre-determined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the central Command Post (CP). A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with emergency personnel from responding agencies, as needed. \n\nThis coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
