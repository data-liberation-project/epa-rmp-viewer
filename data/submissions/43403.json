THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS\n3.THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n      A.THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 80,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .94 MILES\n      B.THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMOMIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200PPM) IS .78 MILES\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n      THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA,K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE ,INC. AND STANDARDS OF THE U.S.OCCUPATIONAL SAFETYAND HEALTH AD"
