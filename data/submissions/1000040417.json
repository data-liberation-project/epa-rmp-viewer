Grande Cheese uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The Grande Cheese refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 3 psi to a high side of 185 psi. The systems maximum intended inventory is 27,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\n\nThe Grande Cheese worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is 16,028 pounds at 100% full. The normal operating level in the HPR is 4,808 pounds, so the worst-case release scenario takes in account the possibility the vessel would be 80% full holding 12,882 pounds. Using the RMP Comp program downloaded from the EPA Home Page the calculated toxic endpoint was 2.2 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 444, with 170 residential housing, in the area. There are no hospitals located within the area.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The vessel capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is described above. Although the worst case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling it is not a likely scenario to take place. Grande Cheese Company follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system. By following the industrial standards and the EPA / OSHA standards the shell failure unlikely.\n\n\n\nANSI/IIAR-2 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.\n\n\n\nANSI/ASHRAE 15-1992 Safety C"

The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided a pressure relief valve release of 10 minutes releasing 82lbs/mn from the High Pressure Receiver. The toxic endpoint for the release would be .20 miles down wind. The estimated population within the distance would be 0 people. There is no school, no residential housing. There are no hospitals in the area.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency response Policies:\n\nThe Grande Cheese Company has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release. Grande Cheese Company has also coordinated efforts with the Volunteer Fire Department to establish a joint response program. The Grande Cheese established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nGrande Cheese Company has trained personnel that are the refrigeration operators to assure they can perform their responsibilities and procedures safely.

The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or a flange bolt or initiating a system shut down.
