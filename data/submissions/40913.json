In support of these requirements, White Sands maintains four fire stations, each staffed with  HAZMAT-trained personnel.  Station 1 is located at the White Sands Post Headquarters and services main post and lower range areas.  Station 1 would respond in the event of a Lance Missile accident located at the munitions storage area.  A total of 30 HAZMAT-trained personnel are stationed at Station 1 on Main Post.  Station 2 is located at Launch Complex 37 and provides emergency response to the missile launch complex areas in the vicinity of Nike Road, east of Main Post.  A total of 10 HAZMAT-trained personnel are stationed at Station 2.  Station 3, located at Stallion Range Center, maintains 14 HAZMAT-trained personnel and services the upper range areas, north of Main Post.  Station 4 is located at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility located along Hwy 70, northeast of Main Post, and maintains 12 HAZMAT-trained personnel.   A total of 75 (66 HAZMAT-trained) fire fighters are stationed at WSMR.\n\nA description of the facility and regulated substances handled.\nWhite Sands conducts testing and evaluation of military and commercial systems.  The operation at White Sands that is covered by the Risk Management Program regulation (40 CFR, Part 68) is the storage of Lance Missiles that contain unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA).  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nWhite Sands complies with the U.S. Department of Defense Exposives Safety Board (DDESB) when handling and storing munitions of any type.  The DDESB standards are designed to minimize the potential for harm to human health and the environment.  In addition to this protective and stringent regulation, the White Sands Fire Department"

Also, a written Environmental Spill and Disaster Control Plan, updated 29 September 1997 and field-tested 1 March 1999, is in place and ready for implementation in case of an accidental release.\n\nFive-year accident history.\nWithin the past five years, White Sands has had no accidental releases from the Lance Missiles.  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.\n\nThe emergency response program.\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the Lance Missile magazines,entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the White Sands emergency response point of contact indicated in the RMP.  The White Sands Fire Department is fully trained and prepared to respond to emergencies at White Sands.  The White Sands Fire Department would be the first responders in the event of an accidental release (fire, explosion, spill, etc.) at the Lance Missile storage facility.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nWhite Sands has plans to upgrade Fire Station 2 and emergency response personnel undergo regular training."
