A contract has been formalized with Clean Harbors Inc, an emergency response contractor to provide on site and off site emergency response services in the event of a release."

Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM ) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel.  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nVW&R invites and encourages local eme"

      "SummaryText": "rgency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with VW&R products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Twinsburg Ohio site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers in Ohio, northwestern New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Prepackaged containers of 37% formaldehyde solution are handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 15,000 lbs. The typical inventory level for formaldehyde is 25,000 lbs. in drums or intermediate bulk containers.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario for the site would involve a total container failure releasing 330 gallons of formaldehyde solution according to the EPA proscribed release protocol. This would result in a release of 1070 pounds of formaldehyde in 10 minute time period. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 530 feet or .1 mile. \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario would involve a partial container failure with release of 25 gallons of formaldehyde solution resulting in a release of 80 pounds of formaldehyde in a 5 minute time period. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of up to 530 feet or .1 mile.\n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, VW&R is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and utilizes this program to meet the prevention program requirements under RMP.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the following:\n1.The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2. Employee training and operating procedures.\n3. Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4. Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines  \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe site has experienced no accidents as specified"
