Chelan Manson Fruit, LLC is the owner of this property which is managed and operated by Chelan Fruit Co-operative who own neighboring plants as well.  The Chelan Fruit Co-op has reported their RMP to EPA under Facility ID: 100000147833, commonly known as Chelan Facility.  Until their most recent re-submission dated 4/18/2018, the Chelan Facility RMP report included this subject property.  Because the properties are legally owned by two different entities, separate reporting is necessary.  This First Time Submission is made in an effort to establish separate reporting for two separate facilities.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used on-site at the Chelan Manson Fruit facility.  Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:  Prevent unnecessary human exposure; Reduce the threat to our personnel; and Reduce the threat to the community.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is a cold storage warehouse located near the City of Chelan, in the County of Chelan, State of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used as a refrigerant. There is approximately 14,412 pounds of ammonia in the overall facility which is approximately 137,200 sq ft warehouse with multiple vessels and extensive piping.  The largest vessel could potentially release 6,369 pounds of ammonia. There are no other hazardous substances on-site that meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following:\n\nContinuing training for personnel\n\nMaintenance programs as described in the PSM program\n\nUse of safety equipment and procedures\n\nUse of accurate, effective written operating proc"

Procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  These procedures include:\n\nShut down procedures (routine and emergency)\n\nPre-start up safety procedures\n\nRoutine operations\n\nMaintenance of all equipment\n\nResponse to major and minor releases\n\nEmergency action plan\n\n\n\nChelan Manson Fruit has had no accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\n\n\nIn addition to operating procedures, Chelan Manson Fruit has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing safety training.  The response plan is coordinated with Chelan County Fire District 7.\n\n\n\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity will be a major ongoing process at Chelan Manson Fruit, LLC.
