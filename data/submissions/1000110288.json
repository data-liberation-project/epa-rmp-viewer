The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the ProMix Fractionation Plant is coordinated with the Assumption Parish Emergency Management organization (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The ProMix Fractionation Plant has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations. The following changes are planned for implementation at the ProMix Fractionation Plant.\n\n* No changes are planned."

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant uses Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented to ensure that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention pro"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.\n\nEnterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.
