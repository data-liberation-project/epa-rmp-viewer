      "SummaryText": "     Kova Ag Products, Inc. (dba Crop Fertility Specialists) worked with the previous owners of this facility (Bruder family) for several years before purchasing the facility January 1, 2008.  CFS is a family owned company just like the Bruder family and is committed to building upon the successes at this facility, and remains a committed part of the working part of the LaCrosse, IN community.  Anhydrous ammonia is a vital crop nutrient for corn production, and CFS works hard to help local farmers get access to a timely supply of product to help them grow a good crop.\n\n\n\n    Fortunately, our ammonia storage facility is in an area that is not densely populated, and is bordered by a hill and trees on two sides of the property that would limit a cloud of escaped anhydrous ammonia vapor somewhat. By nature, anhydrous ammonia vapor clouds tend to hug the ground and follow waterways that somewhat limits the product movement until  it has evaporated into harmless products (Nitrogen and Hydrogen gasses).  Our company has a very committed safety inspection and equipment replacement policy, and we regularly practice our emergency response efforts to limit the possibility and severity of a large or small scale ammonia release. We regularly train our employees in classroom and on-the-job sessions, and never allow an employee to work with ammonia without training and mentoring from our more senior employees. In the event of a release we have action plans in place that our employees have been made aware of.  This action plan has provisions for employee safety, public notification, and notification of the proper authorities.  Local response from neighborhood fire departments are a key element of our response plan, and we annually invite them onto the facility to conduct first hand experience with our processes.\n\n                                                                                Respectfully,\n\n\n\nKova Ag Products,Inc.\n\nKyle Burgess - location manager\n\nKevin Wyatt -  KAP"
