      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCITY OF OCOEE, MIMS PLANT\n\n\n1.    Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe A. D. Mims Waste Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Ocoee.  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.\n\n2.    Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe A.D. Mims Waste Water Treatment Plant is located adjacent to a residential area at A.D. Mims Road, in Ocoee, Orange County, Florida.  The City of Ocoee uses chlorine as a disinfectant for sewage treatment process.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to five one-ton containers at the chlorination process building.  Two one-ton containers are always connected to the process, while up to three additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 10,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not enclosed in a building, but sheltered with a three-sided metal shed.\n\n3.    Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the A.D. Mims Chlorination process in the Program 3 level.  The A.D. Mims facility will address all elements for the Prevention Program 3 as required by the RMP rule.\n\nThe city of Ocoee will have a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was created in 1999 and was audited in April 2004.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination process to ensure consistency of operation "

      "SummaryText": "and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operation condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the City of Ocoee.  These will be reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination and wastewater industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation will also be incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4.    Accident History\n\nThe A.D. Mims facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe A.D. Mims WWTP has an Emergency Response Plan in place.   The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Ocoee Fire Department.  Notification is made by dialing the local Fire Department and by Notification of the Florida State Warning Point."
