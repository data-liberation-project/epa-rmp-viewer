In \r\naddition to these resources, Wacker is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can draw from pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.  As a member of the LEPC, Wacker regularly stages emergency response drills both in-house and outside with emergency responders from the public and private sector.  LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel, and emergency procedures.  \r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe process safety information and systems are evaluated regularly through the Operational Plant Hazard Reviews, with industry-wide changes in standards and as a result of incidents that have occurred within the chemical industry.  The VAM storage tanks have no outstanding upgrade recommendations.  \r\n\r\nThe Calvert Area Emergency Warning System (CAEWS) is an emergency notification system to alert the community of  a chemical and/or weather related emergency.  The system is composed of a siren network in Calvert City and Livingston County that is activated by the 911 operator.  The 911 operator is backed up by the safety officer at Evonik, who can also activate the system.  In the event of an emergency, 911 would activate the sirens and voice command modules that are placed in public buildings such as the Convalescent Center, City Hall, and the Calvert City Elementary School.  Once a citizen has heard the siren or the voice command module alert, they are to turn their radio on the local Calvert City radio station (WCCK) and listen for specific instructions.  The sirens are routinely tested one day per month.  \r\n\r\nThe CAEWS also has a telephone notification system that can be activated by any of the ten participating plants.  In the event of a chemical emergency, a plant could activate the system to notify everyone in the community within a five mi"

Containment dikes around the storage tanks are designed to hold the entire contents of the tank.  \r\n\r\nEach plant process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and start-up.  All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operating Plant Hazards Reviews (OPHRS) are conducted by teams of supervisors, engineers, operators, mechanics, and EH&S professionals.  \r\n\r\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the production unit, plant, and corporate levels.  These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and tracked through plant safety management systems. \r\n\r\n4.  Five year accident history:\r\n\r\nNone of the stationary sources or covered processes at the Wacker plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years that would be reported under RMP.

      "SummaryText": "nnessee River is considered a separate facility under RMP.  This facility unloads Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) from barges.  VAM is unloaded from  the barges and transferred to one of two storage tanks, FB-4515 or FB-4516.  VAM is pumped to the main plant via a pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe only RMP regulated substance handled at this stationary source is Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a toxic liquid.  The maximum quantity of VAM inventoried in an individual storage tank is 11,745,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario (toxics) for the river facility is complete failure of containment by that vessel (tank FB-4516) with containment by the dike that surrounds the tank.  The alternative case scenario is leakage of the entire tank capacity to the dike.  This was selected because if a leak were discovered to be ongoing within the dike it might be a case where we would not send a worker into the dike to stop the leak (unsafe to have them walk in VAM).  If the leak were discovered outside of the dike we would take steps to isolate the leak by shutting valves upstream and downstream from the leak. \r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\r\n\r\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.  This protection  \r\nstarts with the facility design and construction.  Wacker meets or exceeds all design and construction codes when implementing new projects in the plant.  A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping.  These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques with records maintained in the permanent equipment files.  \r\n\r\nBarge unloading activities are controlled by two people that are present during the unloading.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe Wacker Chemical Corporation, Polymers Division (Wacker) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:\r\n\r\n1.  The main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and\r\n2.  The storage, pipeline, and vinyl acetate barge unloading source at the Tennessee River.  \r\n\r\nThe largest quantity raw material feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of Wacker's VAE Emulsions and SekiSui Polyvinyl Alcohol.  Ethylene is also used in the production of VAE dispersions (emulsions).  VAM, and ethylene are above threshold quantities at the main plant.  Only Vinyl Acetate is present at the unloading facility on the Tennessee River.  \r\n\r\nWacker is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and \r\nenvironmental performance.
