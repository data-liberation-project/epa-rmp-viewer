Furthermore, Convent Refinery's commitment is validated through participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), in which Convent Refinery has maintained VPP Star status since December, 1995.\n\nHowever, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n2.0\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nConvent Refinery is located near the intersection of Louisiana Highways 44 and 70 at Union, St. James Parish, Louisiana. The refinery is situated along the east bank of the Mississippi River at mile marker 168. Convent Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, furnace oil, etc.) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane, as well as flammable mixtures. \n\nOne of the by-products of petroleum refining is hydrogen sulfide, which is an EPA RMP listed toxic substance.

Hydrogen sulfide is not stored in the refinery, and the quantity in any single process does not exceed the EPA RMP threshold quantity.\n\nOther substances used in the refinery that appear on the EPA RMP toxic substance list include chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia. However, the quantity of these substances in any process is also below the EPA RMP thresholds.\n\n3.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nSince Convent Refinery does not currently contain any RMP-listed toxic materials above the threshold quantity in any single process, no offsite consequences relating to toxics are reported.\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage sphere containing butane. No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventory of 2,529,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. This scenario is expected to have offsite impact. Although Convent Refinery has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of 32,056 pounds of a flammable mixture containing pentane vapor, released over a 10-minute period, from a two inch diameter hole in or around 91F-302, Hydrogenation Reactor. The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation). The endpoint for this scenario is expected to be offsite; however, no offsite impact is expected. \n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Convent Refinery.

MSDSs are readily available through Convent Refinery's computer system. \nConvent Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of  construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical area classifications, piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs), etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.  \n\n4.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nConvent Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\nConvent Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and  mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams findings are entered into a computer data base and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. \n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or  process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Convent Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer data base, assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. Final resolution of the findings is also documented in the data base.\n\n4.4\tOperating Procedures\n\nConvent Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation for critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc., are included in the operating procedures. \n\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, Convent Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and proces"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n4.5\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Convent Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not  already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training. The operating procedures are grouped into modules, and each operator is expected to review the assigned modules and pass the prescribed tests over a period of three years. Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort. All operator training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n4.6\tContractors\n\nConvent Refinery uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities.

This is accomplished by: (1) evaluating the safety programs and performance of prospective contractors, (2) basic safety training of contract employees by approved outside agencies, (3) site specific orientation training of contract employees, (4) prework conference with contractor supervision, (5) providing contractors with process overview information, and (6) monitoring contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n \n4.7\tPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nConvent Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a significant change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n4.8\tMechanical Integrity  \n\nConvent Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps an"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2.\tHydrogen sulfide (H2S) detectors with alarms.\n3.\tProcess units manned around the clock.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and  incinerate episodic releases.\n2.\tRemotely activated valves that discharge to a closed flare system for emergency de-pressuring.\n3.\tManual and remotely operated emergency shutdown valves to permit isolation of the process.\n4.\tHardwire alarms for specific process parameters (e.g., high/low level, high temperature, etc.).\n5.\tAutomated emergency shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high/low level, high temperature, etc.).\n6.\tDistributed control system throughout the facility.\n7.\tComputer control of specific process parameters for maximizing process stability.\n8.\tCurbing or diking to contain liquid rel"

The company recognized that process safety and plant reliability performance have large overlaps. Today process safety and reliability are recognized as interdependent and need to be managed together.\n\nThe focus of the Process Safety Initiative (PSI) is to make a step change improvement in key business practices that are fundamental to process safety performance. Additionally, these practices are coordinated and consistent across all company refineries.\n\nThirteen business practices were identified as fundamental to process safety performance and are now being introduced in refineries. These practices are the consolidation of the best practices and thinking of refinery personnel and company technical staff.\n\nA refinery manager or company executive serves as sponsor and champion of each permanent practice, which include disciplined work process methodologies, which will also measure progress and compliance. \n\nThe definitions of the thirteen business practices of PSI are given below:\n\nPressure Equipment Integrity - is proactive management of the integrity of all pressure equipment through \u00bfShared Stewardship of Assets.\u00bf It looks beyond the Inspection department and involves everyone who is affected by or has input into the use and reliability of pressure equipment. The goal is to maximize equipment life and eliminate failures and leaks, protect the equipment as intended, monitor the physical integrity of the equipment, and repair, upgrade or replace the equipment as necessary.\n\nInstrumented Protective Function \u00bf Specially designated instruments and shut down systems are used to protect equipment, as well as personnel and the environment, from exceeding certain conditions, such as temperature or pressure. This initiative follows a def"

Operating procedures are defined as a set of written instructions that, when followed by the operations personnel, will minimize deviations from design or operating intent.\n\nOperator Training \u00bf The Company Refinery Standard for Training defines a highly structured program of operator training that is closely aligned with the business objectives of the company refineries. All employees who will be involved in operating a process will be expected to successfully complete a training program that consists of a predefined set of learning modules to prepare employees for specific job assignments. This standard also provides for skill maintenance and improvement through refresher training. At Convent, this practice has been enhanced with the establishment the Learning and Development Center.\n\nMeasurement and Goals \u00bf collects leading and lagging process safety metrics to establish baselines for the company refineries. This baseline data, coupled with historical performance and external benchmarks, will communicate lessons learned and spot safety-related trends. One of the leading indicators is the number of PHA open recommendations.\n\nAudits and Assessments \u00bf establishes uniform guidelines and methods for perf"

This covers Compliance Assurance Reviews (CARs); Safety, Health and Environmental Management Systems Assessments (MSA) focus on management systems; Facility Self Assessment (FSA) focus on safety health and environmental topics; Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) compliance with applicable OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations; and Focused Technical Reviews (FTRs). This is an ongoing requirement and has been implemented.\n\n\nInvestigation \u00bf Three types of investigation methods will be required and applied according to the perceived severity of the incident or near miss. Type 1 is typically an individual fact based review of the event. Type 2 is a formal, structured fact based analysis completed by a small group and facilitated by a trained coordinator. Type 3 is Root Cause Analysis (RCA) facilitated by a trained coordinator. \n\nReliability Centered Maintenance \u00bf is a structured, risk based analysis of systems with the goal of creating a maintenance and surveillance strategy that economically maintains the reliability and integrity of the system analyzed. Process systems are analyzed for function as well as failure modes. Each piece of equipment is reviewed and risk based equipment criticality, economical maintenance and surveillance maintenance are developed to ensure reliability. Running maintenance of the system involves surveillance tasks, establishing operating limits and performing mechanical maintenance tasks. This program promotes proactive maintenance focusing on both preventative and predictive activities.\n\nConsolidate Operating Limits and Targets \u00bf consolidates and arbitrates Operating Limits and Targets recommendations from different disciplines. The goal is a single source; central repository of a refinery\u00bfs limits and targets organized unit by unit.

A comprehensive plan identifying the response required by the monitoring group (operations) is used if the monitored targets approach and or exceed the bound limits. The goal would be to move the monitoring of Convent\u00bfs operating processes from a reactive approach (responding to alarms) to a more pro-active approach (monitor variable trends and take action prior to an alarm). The process envisions Convent having fewer alarms and Instrumented Protective Function (IPF) activation events over time. As a result of implementing this process, Convent should minimize equipment degradation, predict and regulate wear and loss of containment and/or function and better optimize the overall refinery operation.\n\nSince the company first generated the business practice list, the last three areas have been combined with two other processes into one, Ensure Safe Production. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \u00bf establishes a consistent methodology at all the company refineries.
