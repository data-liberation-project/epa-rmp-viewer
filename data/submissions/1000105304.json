These precautions include safety controls (detection systems, alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\nThe Grande Cheese Company located in Juda, WI, is a production facility processing various cheese products. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and preservation in production and storage areas. To protect its employees, the public, and the environment, an integrated safety management program has been established to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Grande Cheese facility.\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\nThe Grande Cheese facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management Standard and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following"

Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that activate if ammonia is detected.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Juda Volunteer Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\nThis cheese processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Grande Cheese has also trained personnel in the Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response Program, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWAOPER. The trained personnel have been trained to the Technician Level Responder, and also, Incident Command training.  The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate.

Grande Cheese expects to evaluate each PHA and compliance audit recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
