If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Fenton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a farmer owned cooperative.  We sell agricultural products to members and non-members.  We sell NH3 for the sole purpose of fertilization of farm ground.  This facility consists of one 30,000 gallon tank.  \n\nOur worst-case senario would be the sudden release of the tank at a time when it was filled to capacity.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to endpoint would be 4.4 miles with an approximate popluation of 456 people.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, or evacuations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our NH3 plant, it is our policy to notify the Fenton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire depratment and members of the fire department have inspected our NH3 facility.\n\nThere are no planned changes of our proceedures or policies."
