Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at the Facility for cooling the building and mixers.  This facility complies with the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15 for the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is the policy of Earthgrains to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nEarthgrains has in place policies which limit the amount of ammonia at the Facility.  Additionally, Earthgrains has prevention and management programs which are implemented to increase the safe operation of the system.  Earthgrains believes that safe operations and accident prevention is the way to do business everyday.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is Earthgrains policy to notify Carrollton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Earthgrains has discussed this policy with the fire department members of the department have inspected the facility.  In the past five years, the facility has not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe maximum amount of ammonia stored to 8,480 pounds in the high pressure receiver and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  The worst-case scenario for ammonia is a failure of the storage tank and release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.  Based USEPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 1.2 miles.  Approximately 16,300 people live within the 1.2 mile radius from the facility.  Topographic maps and visual receptor surveys indicated the area has other industrial properties, churches, public recreational areas and two schools within this area as well.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia is a \"pull-away\" failure during filling operations when the most that would release is the contents of the filling hose (app"
