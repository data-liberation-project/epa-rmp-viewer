The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant (BWWTP) is owned by the City of Buda, Texas and operated by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA).  The plant is located in Hays County, Texas at 575 County Road 236, approximately one (1) mile north of Main Street.  Gas chlorine is the only hazardous chemical on site.  Only two containers are set-up for use at any given time, with only one container actually having chlorine drawn from it for disinfection of the wastewater.  The gas is drawn off the container under a vacuum.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a valve located on the chlorine container automatically closes, stopping flow of the chorine gas and thus reducing the chance of a chlorine release.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence an"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorination processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant develops and maintains operat"

A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n\n\n\n4.5    Maintenance\n\n\n\nThe City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant properly maintains the equipment in our processes.  The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant maintenance program includes:\n\n\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n\n\n4.6    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\n\n\n\nThe City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The City of Buda Wastewater Treatment Plant trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n\n\n4.8    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine"
