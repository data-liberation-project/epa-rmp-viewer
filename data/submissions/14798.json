Management is fully commited to safety and implementation of safe procedures.This commitment is demonstrated thru New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act which the Authority has been subject to since 1989.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled \n\n  The Authority operates a wastewater treatment plant which serves 46 communities in Bergen County.\nChlorine is used for effluent disinfection. Chlorine is stored on site in one-ton containers containing liquid and gas under pressure.Chlorine liquid is drawn from the containers and fed theough evaporaters, where it is converted to gas, then mixed with dilution water and delivered into the plant effluent thru diffusers. The plant has two chlorine storage and control buildings. Maximum on-site quantity is 50 containers, or 100,000 pounds of Chlorine,. Average daily chlorine use is 2,000 pounds.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate release\n\n  The worst case scenario entails the release of 2000 lbs of chlorine from a ruptured container. The release rate is 110 lbs per minute. Release durationis 10 minutes. The release is in an enclosed building, in direct contact with outside air.The topography is urban surroundings, with many obstacles in the immediate area. The toxic endpoint is 0.0087 mg/l, based on ERPG-2. Distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles (i.4 kilometers). This scenario made the following assumptions: wind speed-1,5 meters/sec (3.4 miles/hour); stability class-F; Temperature-77 degrees F(25 degrees C).\n\n  The alternative case scenario entails a chlorine release thru a 0.375 in diameter hole or puncture (0.1104 sq in). Release duration is 30 minutes at a pressure of 100 psi and a temperature of 77 degrees F. The release rate is 18.5 lbs per minute. The release is in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.The topography is urban surroundings, with many obstacles in "

The program entails a developed risk management plan which includes regular safety reviews,standard operating procedures, a preventive maintenance program, operator training, accident investigation, risl assessment, emerhency response, annual audits, management of modifications and a contractor program to monitor the work of contractors on or adjacent to the chlorine facilities. Exercise drills in emergency response (2) are conducted annually. Extensive records are kept for equipment maintenance and replacement. Annual reports summarizing plan activites are submitted to the State. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection conducts an annual inspection and lists program deficiencies. Monthly reports listing the work done to correct the deficiences are submitted to the State by the BCUA until all deficiences are resolved.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n  There have been no accidental releases during the past five years which caused injury to BCUA personnel or had off-site impact\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n  The BCUA has an emergrncy plan which outlines actions to be taken in an actual emergency Major components of the program are:\n        Emergency Response Team (ERT) - The ERT consists of plant personnel who undergo training in\n        response to, and mitigation of chlorine releases. Two emergency drills are conducted each \n        calender year. Following each drill, deficiences are noted and recommendations for corrections are\n        made and implemented. The traini"

The local emergency planning\n        coordinator(LEPC), which is the Little Ferry police and fire departments, and Bergen County \n        emergency units, can be called for assistance. The supervisor of training and emergency response\n        is responsible for training the ERT A written emergency response plan is distributed to selected\n        locations on site and to off-site emergency responders. The plan identifies types of incidents that \n        might result in a release and the types of releases likely. Itt outlinse emergency response procedures\n        in accordance with the Chlorine Institute, the Water Environment Federation, suppliers, vendors and\n        manufacturers. Emergency procedures are tailored to the additional requirements of the local \n        community.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n  The BCUA is presently constructing a system to use liquid sodium hypochlorite for effluent disinfection. The usec of gaseous chlorine will be discontinued. The sodium hypochlorite system is planned to be fully on line by July, 2000. A temporary hypochlorite system is being installed to allow demolition of the gaseous chlorine equipment as part of the hypochlorite constriction contract. The temporary system is expected to be on line by July, 1999. Eliminatrion of the gaseous chlorine will remove all the hazards associated with it."
