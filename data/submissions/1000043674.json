Refresher training is provided at least every other year and when processes are modified, new equipment installed or as deemed necessary by operations management.\r\n\r\n4.5 Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nWe perform and record maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined during these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, monitors and other elements. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices and chemical safety. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n4.6 Management of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Arclin to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

No incidents have occurred in more than 5 years. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Arclin uses the ABS Consulting Root-Cause Analysis program for incident analysis. Many of our employees have been formally trained in this process. All incident analysis reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n4.10 Employee Participation\r\n\r\nArclin Surfaces truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Corporate Policies\r\n\r\nArclin is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that we have in place for our Portland facility. This program covers areas such as equipment design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our resin and overlay manufacturing and processes. It is our policy to implement effective controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances from our operations.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur primary activities are manufacturing of phenolic resin and phenolic overlays. We store and use only one regulated substance (formaldehyde solution) at our facility. The formaldehyde solution is a 50% (by weight) solution of formaldehyde in water and is used as a raw material to manufacture phenolic resins and glues.\r\nThe maximum inventory of formaldehyde solution at our facility is currently 321,600 lbs.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nTo perform the off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used ALOHA evaporation calculations and dispersion modeling. We compared these results to manual calculations using the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance. There was close agreement between these methods. The following paragraphs provide details of two release scenarios that we considered.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for formaldehyde assumes an instantaneous loss of the entire contents of our formaldehyde storage tank. The tank contains 33,500 gallons of a 50% formaldehyde solution in water.\r\nThe solution is stored at 140&#8304;F (60&#8304;C). The r"

Allowing for the excluded volume of other tanks, the spill puddle covers 4,700 square feet.\r\nEvaporation of the formaldehyde spill occurs at a rate dependent on the vapor pressure of formaldehyde gas over the solution of formaldehyde in water. We used NOAA/EPA's ALOHA 5.4.1.1 modeling program and NOAA's Cameo Chemical datasheets to estimate releases from this spill scenario. According to NOAA's data, the vapor pressure of 50% formaldehyde is 18 mm Hg at our storage temperature. Due to the large volume of the spill, the solution does not cool appreciably when it contacts the concrete containment area.\r\n\r\nThe ALOHA program calculated a maximum release rate of formaldehyde to air of approximately 11.71 pounds/minute. Assuming this rate occurred for 10 min, 117 lbs of formaldehyde would be released. This  is expected to form a plume of contaminated air above the EPA toxic endpoint (0.012 mg/L) approximately 0.6 miles long and between 0.1 and 0.5 miles wide (depending on variations in wind direction and speed).\r\n\r\nThese results were compared to those calculated using the EPA's Off-site Consequences Manual. The OSC calculation showed a distance to the same toxic endpoint of 0.62 miles, consistent with the ALOHA calculations. The results of the ALOHA calculations are shown graphically in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario was also prepared for formaldehyde solution. The alternative release scenario assumed a leak from the tank's delivery line. This is more likely than the complete failure of the tank. The solution will cool upon contact with the concrete containment dike and begins to solidify at approximately 125&#8304;F. A maximum release rate of 12.1 lbs/minute was calculated using ALOHA. A release duration of 60 minutes was assumed with the release rate decreasing with time. The ALOHA model calculated a distance of 0.16 miles to the toxic endpoint. This is"
