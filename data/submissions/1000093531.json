This RMP program includes:\n\n\n\n1. Overview of Process Safety Management\n\n    \n\n2. General Description of Facility\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Information\n\n    \n\n4. Process Technologies    \n\n    \n\n5. Normal Process Operation    \n\n \n\n6. Non-Routine Activities\n\n\n\n7. Chlorine Emergency Mitigation Procedures\n\n    \n\n8. Other Important Topics\n\n    \n\n9. Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n10. Offsite Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n11. Audit Schedule\n\n\n\nAn effective RMP program minimizes risk by promoting a safer and more efficient waste water treatment operation through better process control and preventive maintenance. Also, a well thought out Emergency Response Plan will help reduce the impact of a chlorine release.\n\n\n\nThis RMP program meets the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR part 68, which applies to facilities with certain threshold quantities (TQ) of hazardous chemicals, including chlorine (TQ 1,500 lbs). NDSD uses chlorine to disinfect waste water from the North Davis area. The District uses two 80,000 lb pound tanks to store chlorine. However, administrative policy restricts the amount of chlorine in each tank to a maximum of 34,000 pounds, making the maximum amount of chlorine onsite 68,000 lbs. Because NDSD utilizes chlorine in these quantities, the District is covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n \n\nIt is NDSD's goal to provide a safe and cost effective way for treating wastewater generated by residents and businesses. Present treatment operations at NDSD require the use of chlorine for disinfection. With respect for the potential hazards involved with using this chemical, NDSD has taken many steps to prevent its release.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nSince NDSD has been in operation there has not been one significant release of chlorine. No District employees have ever been injured by a chlorine release. Fur"

      "SummaryText": "thermore, no off-site or public receptors, human or animal, have been injured by an air release of chlorine. During the last 40 years of treating wastewater, NDSD has never had a significant chemical accident of any kind.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nDue to the highly automated and fault tolerant delivery system, the likelihood of even a minor chlorine release is very low. The entire delivery system, beginning at the storage tanks and ending at the chlorine injectors, is maintained under constant vacuum pressure. This system automatically and instantaneously shuts down the flow of chlorine in the event of a fault or break in the line. The entire chlorine delivery systems, including the chlorine tanks, undergo rigorous integrity tests and are routinely inspected by NDSD personnel and by professional contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only is NDSD's chlorination system engineered to be very fault tolerant, but it is also operated in a safe manner. NDSD is very pro-active in accident prevention and preventive maintenance of their chlorination equipment and associated controls, including:\n\n\n\n- routine upgrades, change-outs and rebuilding of disinfection delivery and storage equipment as recommended by equipment manufacturers,\n\n\n\n- frequent mechanical integrity inspections on equipment and intrinsic and extrinsic safety controls for processes, and\n\n\n\n- frequent training insures that district operating procedures are efficiently established.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency release of chlorine, NDSD has a highly competent and well trained Emergency Response Team, (ERT), with personnel both on-site and on call around the clock. The members of this ERT are HAZWOPER trained to safely maintain, repair, and operate the chlorination and associated equipment. Moreover, these individuals receive frequent specific training for responding to and managing chlorine releases. Members of the NDSD ERT are equipped and trained for chlorine emergencies and coordinate emergency response"

However, NDSD understands that extreme events (e.g., natural disasters) could potentially push these systems beyond what they were designed to withstand. Therefore, as technology changes and different means of disinfection become practical solutions, NDSD will research and implement new equipment and processes to further reduce the hazards associated with the storage of chemicals that may harm district employees, the public or the environment.\n\n\n\nCertification Statement\n\n\n\nAs the District Manager of North Davis Sewer District, I, the undersigned, certify that the following document is NDSD's Risk Management Program and describes our current operations and best efforts for preventing and planning for emergency releases of chlorine.
