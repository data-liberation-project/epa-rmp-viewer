Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nOrganic Girl, LLC conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOrganic Girl, LLC uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Figures R0.0 and R1.0 in RMP Appendix App.8.1* show the facility location map and site plan. The ammonia system is used for fresh produce cold storage, chilled water generation and vacuum cooling. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, screw and reciprocating type compressors, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporator cooling coils, pressure cooler systems, make-up air cooler, and diffusion tank. Portable systems are, two plate frame type water chiller skids, seven falling film water chiller skids, one low pressure recir"

All of the refrigeration equipment except high side trailer and the full car vacuum tube stay operational throughout the year. High side trailer and the full car tube are brought to site during the summer season (April through November). All of the water chiller skids, low pressure recirculator skid, and half car vacuum tube are tied to main fixed system. High side trailer and full car vacuum tube are isolated from the main system and operate as a separate system when they are on site. All of the fixed refrigeration equipment except the make-up air cooler, evaporative condensers, high-pressure receiver and the diffusion tank are located indoors, and all portable refrigeration systems are located outdoors. Refrigeration High Side Trailer R-92 (RNS1), low pressure recirculator skid and the vacuum tubes (VNS1) are in partnership with Western Precooling Systems (WPS). WPS technicians and operators are responsible in seasonal set-up, start-up, operation, maintenance and daily monitoring of these systems. The refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 24,900 lb, with largest single system ammonia charge approximately 21,800 lb. The refrigeration systems at this facility is single stage vapor compression cycles. In general, the process chemistry for these systems are shown in RMP Chapter 8*. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in the schedules located in RMP Appendix App.8.1: Refrigeration System Drawings*. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in RMP Appendix App.12.2.1*, describe equipment details. Refrigeration system drawings in RMP Appendix App.8.1* show the refrigeration equipment layouts. Anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See RMP Appendix App.8.4* for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n Organic Girl, LLC maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see RMP Chapter 16 and Chapter 16 Appendix: Incident Investigation*. The ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were two reportable incidents within past five years. Both incidents were due to aging equipment developing leaks. These incidents had very little ammonia release a"

Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in RMP Chapter 20*.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and safety inspection are listed in the beginning of the RMP in Chapter 0* as \"Correction Items\". All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\n\n*References to the hard-copy of the RMP available on-site."
