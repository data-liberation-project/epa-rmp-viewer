The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate release Scenario\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our hazard Assetment and the information is in our risk management Program.\n\nAccidental release Prevetnion Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111  Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,  and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is refferred to in this RMP Registration Firm,  see section 8.3(b).\n\n5 Year History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility,  nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off site deaths, injuries property damage,  or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Action plan\n\nthe facility has:     a written emergency plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n           \n                           Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right -to-know information as \nrequired under the SARA Title III EPCPA)\n\n            "
