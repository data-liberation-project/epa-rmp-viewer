In fulfilling this commitment, management will ensure systems are in place to provide the resources and training to identify issues and maintain a safe and healthful environment as indicated by Company standards, accepted safety and environmental practices, and compliance with legislative requirements.  We will operate and maintain our plants, facilities and equipment and handle our raw materials and products in a manner to prevent personal injuries/illnesses, losses to Company property, releases to the environment, or impact to the communities in which we operate.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco San Francisco Area Refinery at Rodeo, located in Rodeo, California, processes crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces gasoline, automotive diesel, butane, fuel oil and petroleum coke.  In order to produce these products, we store and handle large quantities of regulated flammable materials.  In addition, the refinery also uses and stores ammonia above the threshold quantity.\n\nTo reduce air pollution, the Rodeo Refinery power plant is equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction devices that convert oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to harmless nitrogen and water.  These devices use a solution of ammonia in water (aqueous ammonia), a regulated substance, to perform this conversion.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe EPA requires facilities to report on potential worst-case scenarios involving the regulated substances that we handle in amounts exceeding the threshold quantities.  The EPA mandates the release conditions for worst-case scenarios.  As a result, these scenarios ignore prevention programs that are designed to limit the number and size of chemical releases from our"

A toxic worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to be damaged such that it released its entire contents within ten minutes without accounting for response measures that we would take to minimize the impact of such a release.  A flammable worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to suddenly disappear, the contents were to instantaneously vaporize, and a resulting vapor cloud were to ignite and explode.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely event.  It is used to determine a reasonable outer bound for potential impacts in order to coordinate with local emergency responders.  Unlike the worst-case scenarios, our alternate release scenarios are based on actual equipment configurations.  In selecting our alternate release scenarios, we considered our practices and procedures for preventing and minimizing the size of chemical releases.\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Rodeo refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of an aqueous ammonia storage tank.  This material would spill into the tank's secondary containment dike and then evaporate.  The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that releasing the entire contents of one of this tank over a ten-minute period would result in offsite impact.  The ammonia toxic endpoint specified by EPA is 200 ppm (parts per million).\n\nThe alternate release scenario for ammonia is the failure of a loading hose during anhydrous ammonia transfer operations.  This scenario assumes the entire contents of the delivery truck would spill and evaporate.  The results of the alternate release scenario for ammonia indicate that such a release would have an offsite impact.\n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario for the Rodeo Refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of our largest butane storage vessel.

The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that the instantaneous release and subsequent explosion of the entire contents of the vessel would result in offsite impact.  The endpoint specified by EPA for this type of release is an overpressure of 1 psi.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable materials is a flammable vapor cloud formed by a liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, release.  LPG is a mixture of propane and butane, which are the fuels used in home barbecue grills and disposable cigarette lighters.  The results of dispersion modeling indicate that this cloud would remain flammable as it crosses a public road that is beyond our fenceline.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five year accident history for Toscos Rodeo Refinery includes information on accidental releases that occurred between June 1, 1994 and June 1, 1999.  Tosco acquired the Rodeo Refinery from Unocal effective April 1, 1997.  At the time of acquisition, Unocal was involved in litigation over several accidental releases that occurred during this period.  As a result, Toscos access to specific information on releases that occurred at Rodeo prior to April 1, 1997 is limited.  The descriptions of these releases represent our best understanding based on the information available. \n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has experienced two accidental releases since June 1994 that qualify for reporting under the EPA's criteria.\n\nThe first event occurred on September 15, 1994, prior to Tosco's ownership.  This event involved a release of regulated flammables containing small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, which is also a regulated toxic substance.  The released cause offsite odors because of the hydrogen sulfide in the vapors.  There were reports that some of the children at a nearby school sought medical attention as a result of the release.

As a result of this release and numerous reliability problems with the compressor system, the compressor and its associated instrumentation were upgraded in 1996.\n\nThe second event occurred on April 16, 1997.  This incident involved the release of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, both regulated toxic materials, from the Sulfur Recovery Unit.  As a precaution, local officials asked nearby residents to shelter in place.  Investigation of the incident revealed that the event resulted from failure to detect and correct a high-level condition in a process vessel at a processing unit upstream of the Sulfur Recovery Unit.  The vessel overflowed and contaminated the feed to the Sulfur Recovery Unit with hydrocarbons.  These hydrocarbons interfered with the normal process chemistry.  The result was a release of sulfur dioxide and some hydrogen sulfide from the combustor stack.  As a result of the investigation, operators received refresher training on the Sulfur Recovery Unit process chemistry and early detection of upset conditions.  Also, instrumentation at the vessel that overflowed was modified to provide earlier detection of a high-level condition.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following summaries represent numerous prevention programs and practices at the Rodeo Refinery.  Rodeo Refinery employees are committed to operating a safe facility through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these programs and practices.  \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.

In addition, refinery management has a strong commitment to developing and enforcing written policies and procedures and encourages employee input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experience. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information.  This library includes information related to chemicals in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.  These documents include detailed information on chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design and configuration.  This information is available to all employees. \n\nChemical specific information, including hazards, protective measures, symptoms, and first aid procedures is provided via Material Safety Data Sheets.  This information is available in hard copy format and via the refinery computer network.\n\nThe limits for key process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, flow, and level) are documented in the unit operating manuals.  The process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nInformation on the design and construction of process equipment includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that protective features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Rodeo Refi"

Each process is systematically examined using a technique known as process hazard analysis, or PHA.  A team of experienced operators, engineers, and other specialists conducts the analyses.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams recommendations are then reviewed with management personnel for resolution.  Implementation of actions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Actions implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe process hazard analysis for each process unit is updated and re-validated at least every five years.

Basic training addresses applied sciences, job fundamentals, operating skills, and understanding basic refining processes.  The time necessary to successfully complete unit-specific training varies with the requirements of each job and the candidate's previous job experience.  It typically takes 8-24 weeks to qualify for a specific operating post.  Throughout the training process, candidates must continue to qualify by passing written and oral tests, thereby demonstrating understanding and retention of the training materials.  Qualification for all operating posts within a process area can take up to 3 years.\n\nRefresher training on operating procedures is provided to operating employees at least every three years, and refresher safety training is performed annually.  In addition, training emphasizing specific topics is performed as necessary (for example, furnace operation, dock operations, etc.).  Prior to the commissioning of new or modified equipment, written operating procedures are developed and training is provided to affected operating personnel.  Operating personnel also receive training in emergency response and fire fighting procedures.  \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY/MAINTENANCE TRAINING\n\nThe first step in a successful mechanical integrity program is ensuring that equipment and processes are properly designed for their intended use.

The following types of devices are used in various processes throughout the refinery to help prevent incidents: relief valves, rupture disks, check valves, excess flow valves, remotely operated valves, flare systems, automatic interlocks and shutdown systems, hydrocarbon detectors, manual block valves, process alarms (level, temperature, flow, pressure), and computer-aided control systems.  Additionally, the following types of features are used in various processes throughout the refinery to help mitigate (reduce the effects of) incidents: sprinkler systems, deluge systems, dikes or containment berms, fixed firewater monitors, and fire fighting foam delivery systems.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan to protect its workers, the public, and the environment.  The program includes procedures for responding to the release of regulated substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address various aspects of emergen"

The Rodeo Refinery utilizes the Incident Command System in cooperation with local emergency response personnel.  \n\nThe refinery also has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions and training that addresses the use of the equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary to reflect changes in refinery processes and suggested improvement.  Training on changes to the plan is given to affected employees.\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains a qualified fire brigade, an oil spill response team, a hazardous materials team, and a rescue team.  Additionally, several refinery employees are certified emergency medical technicians.  Frequent training and participation in emergency response drills ensures the readiness of the response organization.\n\nThe emergency response program for the Rodeo Refinery is coordinated with Contra Costa Health Services, the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District, the Crockett Carquinez Fire Protection District, and the Contra Costa County Office of Emergency Services.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Rodeo Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency responders.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident and facilitating a quick response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nContinuous Improvement: The Rodeo Refinery continuously seeks and evaluates methods to improve the safety of its operations.

Improvements in technology provide another opportunity to enhance facility safety.  For example, the refinery discontinued use of gaseous chlorine several years ago when less hazardous substitutes became viable.  Additionally, the refinery is phasing out the use of small quantities of anhydrous ammonia by substituting aqueous ammonia, an inherently safer chemical.\n\nYear 2000 (Y2K) Preparedness: Tosco Corporation and the Rodeo Refinery have developed Y2K Task Forces to investigate, develop, and implement plans to minimize any disruption that might occur because of Y2K.  Computer software and hardware systems are being reviewed for Y2K compliance, and contingency pre-plans are being developed to address any potential in-plant or supplied utility failures."
