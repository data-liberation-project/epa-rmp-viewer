Crestwood management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Alto Storage Terminal is owned and operated by Crestwood Services LLC where propane and butane are received via railcar and stored in pressure tanks or underground storage caverns. Propane and butane are loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only. Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize propane prior to sale. Propane, butane and ethyl mercaptan are the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Alto Storage Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nThere are two separate processes at the facility. Process Number 1 is the plant facility, including all pressure storage tanks and underground caverns at the site. Process Number 2 is the railcar unloading operation, which can include a maximum of eight (8) 33,700 gallon railcars at any one time.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of C"

Analysis of any potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has enabled Crestwood to operate the terminal safely. The program includes identifying potential hazards and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane, butane or mercaptan release has occurred at the Alto Terminal within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which is coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Alto Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Kent County Sheriff's Office, Michigan State Policy, County Emergency Services and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Action Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
