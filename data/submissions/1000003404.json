This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\u00c2\u00bf A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\u00c2\u00bf An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\u00c2\u00bf A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\u00c2\u00bf An overview of our emergency response program\n\u00c2\u00bf An overview of recent improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses sulfur dioxide in the production of Sodium Hydrosulfite and Zinc Oxide for use in the paper and rubber industries.  The EPA has identified sulfur dioxide as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our storage tank holds 287 thousand pounds of sulfur dioxide at the site.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of sulfur dioxide.  We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\n\nAt the Chemtrade Logistic's Kalama"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of sulfur dioxide.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Port of Kalama Emergency Preparedeness Committee Response Plan.  Emergency response drills for SO2 and other site materials have also been conducted with the local emergency response organizations.  \n\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that have recently been made at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases:\n\n- The sulfur dioxide feed system has been revised to reduce the amount of \n  material that is held in the processing area.\n- An SO2 monitoring system that provides an alarm in the event of a release has \n  been installed.\n- A SMART hose has been installed to prevent releases of SO2 in the event of hose  failure.\n-Installation of SO2 system emergency shutoff valves\n\nIn summary, Chemtrade is committed to the safe operation of our facility, and we take the actions necessary to ensure the safety of our employees, members of the community, and the environment."

In fact, none have occurred since the plant began operation in 1969.  However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our facility.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nEmergency Response Planning:\n\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requir"
