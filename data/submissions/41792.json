As part of this commitment, G-P/Crossett has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at G-P/Crossett. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n\u00b7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine).\n \n\u00b7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes).\n\n \u00b7 an emergency response program to respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes. \n\n\u00b7 a management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner,"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\nG-P/Crossett minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n \nG-P/Crossett limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety programs at G-P/Crossett consist of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nG-P/Crossett is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the r"

In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. \n \n 1.4.1\tProgram Level 3 Prevention Program - The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations Program Level 3 Prevention Program that addresses the EPA RMP Rule Prevention Program requirements for the Chlorine Systems and Chlorine Dioxide Solution Systems.\n \n A. Employee Participation The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of G-P/Crossett employees are addressed. The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n \n B. Process Safety Information The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes. The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technical data of the process, and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the processes. The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all G-P/Crossett employees, the LEPC, and the Crossett Fire Department.  \n \n Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, including"

In addition, MSDS's are provided/available to the LEPC, Crossett Fire Department and Plant Emergency Response teams for use in helping formulate emergency response plans\n \n Many of the operating parameters are included in the technical information to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazard analysis, and (3) to help maintain the equipment to the design specification.

Process Hazard Analysis.  G-P/Crossett performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and/or What If' technique, supplemented with checklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations.

G-P/Crossett provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Crossett Paper Operations.\n\n1.2\tGeorgia-Pacific Crossett Operations and Our Regulated Substances\n\nG-P/Crossett is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (Cl02) for the use of bleaching pulp. The facility also stores and uses chlorine in one-ton cylinders for water treament. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3. \n\n 1.3\tOff - Site Consequence Analysis\n\nG-P/Crossett performed an off- site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like G-P/Crossett and, (2) would result in an off- site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n  1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n \n Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.
