It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Henderson Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Mills County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected, and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Henderson, Iowa location is James Russmann, Agronomy Manager.  His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. \n\n              James Russmann, Agronomy Manager\n                    WORK:       (712) 323-7167\n                    24-hour:     (712) 323-6405\n                    Mobile:        (402) 681-5581\n\n              \nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT, AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT FARM SERVICE COMPANY, HENDERSON, IOWA:\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

The plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).  Fulltime equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis.  At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year).  The FTE's for this company location is two (2).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 12,000-gallon Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud-Anhydrous Ammonia) form.  The distance to the endpoint is .79 miles.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the town of Henderson, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons.  An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. \n\nIn addition, the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Finally, Farm Service Company has extended to the Henderson Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nFarm Service Company, Henderson, Iowa has never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in pl"

In the unlikely event that the Henderson Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Henderson location, the Volumteer Fire Department with whom Henderson has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the Fire Department and with Mills County LEPC.  Members of the Fire Department and the LEPC have inspected our Anhydrous Ammonia plant."
