In order to fulfill this mission, PVSC provides a corporate EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately fifteen 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 70,000 pounds.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on site in two stationary storage tanks at 12,000 gallons each.  110,000 Pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 180,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 55,000 pounds.\nThe Worst-Case Scenario\nOur worst-case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000-gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 55,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that this industry has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure re"

This release scenario (distance to point of 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that PVSC has not had a release of this type from its facility.\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program.\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with state regulations, the ASTM and ASME codes, OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), and the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.\n\nOur Ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoff, and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers are protected by excess flow valves to stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  The main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gages and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the sage handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEach location has a 'site safety coordinator' as an extension of the EHS group.  These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the locations contact with the corporate EHS group.  The site safety coordinators act as the location emergency contact.\n\nA Description Of Our Facility And The Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply d"

The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops. \nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process of whenever competency with regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\nFive Year Accident History.\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\nThe Emergency Response Program.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, PVSC has and Emergency Response Plan for our facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).
