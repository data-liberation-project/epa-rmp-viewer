Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Martinsville Facility located approximately 3.7 miles southeast of Martinsville at 9666 East Angling Road Martinsville, IL 62442.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Martinsville Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Martinsville Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena has updated the RMP to report: a change in the RMP Implementation Manager and\r\nEmergency Contact; a change in the Company name; and most recent review of prevention program\r\nelements during the 3-year compliance audit.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Martinsville Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck and then transferred to a 30,000-gallon or 18,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \r\n\r\nHelena stores the anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous ammonia in its two on-site pressure vessels and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the pressure vessels to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates 45 1,000-gallon, six (6) 1,450-gallon, and three (3) 1,450-gallon double set nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its Risk Management Program that includes a prevention program.  \r\n \r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage and filling process. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single pressure vessel were released.  The release was modeled as if the pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a major loading or unloading operation.  This alternative scenario also considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the commercial tanker truck; and back flow check valves and excess flow valves on the pressure vessel side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Warehouse Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Warehouse Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRA"

The RMP will be updated as the Martinsville Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Clark County LEPC and the Martinsville Fire Department.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Martinsville Facility."
