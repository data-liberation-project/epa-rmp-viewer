The PSM/RMP manual is reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nWilliams management understands that it has the duty of providing a safe working environment and of taking measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe GVGP is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility designed to process 100 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas. The purpose of the GVGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas thereby producing residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid.\n\nTo effect this separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system. This process causes the NGL to condense out of the chilled gas stream. As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is sprayed/injected into the field gas to absorb water. Ethylene glycol, NGL, and residue gas are then separated in the cold separator process unit. The remaining gaseous stream is sold as residue gas product and leaves the facility via pipeline. The NGL stream is stored onsite in pressurized storage tanks prior to being trucked offsite for sale. The ethylene glycol is regenerated and reused within the process.\n\nThe PSM-RMP regulated substances handled at this facility are NGL and propane. Following is the break down of the location of these materials at the GVGP.\n\nNGL Product Storage Maximum Weight = 464,526 lbs\nPlant Propane System Maximum Weight = 25,509 lbs\nThe propane refrigeration and the NGL extraction systems at the GVGP are the processes regulated under the 1990 CAAA Section 112?.\n\nBecause of the overfill protection requirement of NFPA 58, all "

      "SummaryText": "pressurized storage tanks are limited to a maximum fill capacity not to exceed 80% of the tank capacity.\n\nRelease scenario. Worst case and alternative case release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility. The worst case scenario considered in this report is the complete release and ignition of the contents of all three (3) Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) storage tanks simultaneously.  This scenario involves approximately 460,000 pounds of NGL?s (actual calculation plus 20% and rounded to two significant digits) and has a distance to endpoint of 0.6 miles from the source of the release.  No active migration can be considered. Worst case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present and the EPA RMP Comp model was used to determine the distance to over pressure of 1.0psi for a vapor cloud explosion of hydrocarbon product. \n\nThe alternative case release scenario is the activation of the inlet pressure safety valve.  Assuming full flow relief this would release 4300 pounds of natural gas per minute for 15 minutes.  RMP comp calculates this release as a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1psi overpressure. At this rate of release, the distance to endpoint is 0.2 miles from the inlet pressure safety valve.  Therefore, the representative alternative scenario is the activation of the inlet pressure safety valve because it results in the greatest distance to endpoint.\n\nPrevention Steps for NGL Release\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the GVGP PSM/RMP manual. The prevention program includes the Program 3 elements. Employee Participation - includes provisions for active participation by plant employees, in the development and implementation of the facility PSM/RMP program as well as ready access to program information, process safety information, which has been collected in the facility office and is summarized i"
