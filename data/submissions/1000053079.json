(RSI) - Hempstead Facility was constructed and began chemical blending operations in 1998. RSI is a specialty chemical manufacturer and oilfield service provider. The company formulates and manufactures treatment chemicals for the oilfield industry, which includes upstream exploration and production (E&P) facilities, distribution networks (gathering systems and pipelines), and gas plants, as well as downstream segments such as storage terminals and refineries.\n\n \n\nRSI places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership. The company employs a proactive approach to managing environment, health and safety (EHS) throughout its operations to ensure that RSI employees work safely, workplace/job site hazards are mitigated or eliminated, environmental impacts are minimized, and that each facility remains in full compliance with applicable federal, state, county, and local laws and regulations. RSI is also committed to environmental stewardship within the communities it serves.\n\n \n\n2) Description of the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n \n\nThe Refinery Specialties Inc. - Hempstead Facility is subject to Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r) Accidental Release Prevention/Risk Management Plan Rule requirements under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68) due to the use of formaldehyde in a manufacturing process. The facility exceeds the qualifying threshold of 15,000 pounds of this chemical on-site for a single process.\n\n \n\nBulk formaldehyde solution (37% concentration by weight) is delivered to the facility via tanker truck. The formaldehyde is off-loaded and stored as a liquid in one of three stainless steel storage tanks (one 3,500-gallon tank and two 5,000-gallon tanks). Only the two 5,000-gallon tanks are currently in use--the 3,500 ga"

The formaldehyde storage tanks are constructed and operated in accordance with ASME and API specifications, respectively. The formaldehyde storage tanks and a dedicated reactor vessel are plumbed together in such a way as to create a closed-loop system, with storage tank vents and pressure relief valves (PRVs) routed to a scrubber system. \n\n\n\nThe formaldehyde and bulk tank storage areas, which are partially enclosed and completely under roof, are equipped with dedicated secondary containment (12\" and 18\" concrete dike walls, respectively) that both minimizes the surface area of a potential spill and provides adequate containment. In addition, a 6\" curb extends around the perimeter of the Building 4 footprint, and incorporates personnel and vehicle/forklift access points. The floor surface near each external roll-up door is sloped upwards. This area provides additional spill containment for both in-process material and finished product, and serves as primary secondary containment in the event of an accidental spill or release at the reactor vessel. \n\n\n\nAs a result of these design features, employee training, and routine inspections, as well as the nature of the regulated process itself (relatively low temperature and low/negative pressure when in operation), RSI has not experienced an accidental release of formaldehyde since process start-up. Off-site first responders for emergencies include the community fire department and contract spill response services, as required.\n\n \n\n3) Brief Description of the Worst Case Scenario, including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the release of the greatest amount of chemical held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity stored.

Trade/industry associations such as the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the American Petroleum Institute (API) have also contributed to the joint development of release evaluation methods.\n\n\n\nThe current recommended release evaluation methodology is contained in the EPA \"RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis\" dated March 2009 (OCA Guideline). The OCA Guideline specifies the performance of an accidental release analysis as part of an RMP Plan prepared for facilities with total hazardous material quantities on site in excess of EPA thresholds. The threshold quantity for a 37% formaldehyde solution is 15,000 pounds. The OCA Guideline is used for this analysis.  Under a worst-case scenario, a single vessel containing 5,000 gallons of 37% formaldehyde is assumed to release with complete indoor containment in the production building housing the regulated process, i.e. within Building 4.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 10 ppm was calculated using Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG's); specifically ERPG-2, which is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\n  \n\nThe OCA Guideline provides the option of a refined analysis as a method for improving estimates of distances to toxic endpoints.

Formaldehyde has a molecular weight greater than that of air, and formaldehyde vapor or gas has a vapor density (approximately 1.04) greater than air (1.0). For the evaluation of an accidental release of formaldehyde, the OCA Guideline requires the determination of a toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint for formaldehyde under the refined analysis option is based on ERPG-2, which represents the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\n \n\nTypical meteorological conditions for the site were developed based on Local Climatological Data (LCD) from the National Weather Service station located at the Hobby International Airport (KHOU) in Houston, Texas. Maximum temperature, average temperature and relative humidity values were determined based on meteorological data available for the most recent three-year period (2012 - 2014) on record.\n\n  \n\nThe SLAB model utilizes a meteorological parameter termed \"surface roughness,\" which represents a measure of the ground surface texture and accounts for the vertical variability (differences in topographic relief or surface elevation) of the surrounding land. Surface roughness is a variable that can potentially impact near-surface wind speeds, as well as the dispersal and turbulent mixing of air pollutants released into the atmosphere at or near ground level, and is therefore a critical modeling parameter for ground-level, denser-than-air release scenarios. The surface roughness in the vicinity of the RSI - Hempstead Facility was calculated using the EPA program AERSURFACE. The Facility is located in a predominantly rural area that is generally free of significant vertical obstacles.\n\n\n"

Input for the SLAB model includes chemical properties for formaldehyde, characteristics of the release, field parameters (e.g., averaging times, maximum downwind distance, etc.), and meteorological parameters. The chemical properties of formaldehyde were obtained from the OCA Guideline and other chemical databases.\n\n\n\nThis analysis includes two meteorological scenarios for evaluation. The 'worst case' scenario is required by EPA in the OCA Guideline for all RMP Plans. RMP Plans may include a more typical 'alternative case' scenario, as recommended in the OCA Guideline.\n\n\n\nThe scenario for the worst case provided in the hazard assessment is called the worst-case release scenario.  For worst-case release scenarios, one scenario is required for each chemical held in RMP-regulated processes at the source.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for formaldehyde was determined to be a loss of formaldehyde resulting from a rupture of the largest formaldehyde solution tank (5,100 gallon capacity) within Building 4, which houses the regulated process. As a worst-case, the solution temperature is assumed to be elevated above ambient, since formaldehyde is typically delivered at elevated temperatures. The spill is assumed to form a ground-level evaporating pool of formaldehyde solution which immediately begins to vaporize pure formaldehyde (37% concentration by weight) into the building, followed by venting to ambient (outside) air. The entire formaldehyde volume within the tank (roughly 5,000 gallons) is assumed to release within 10 minutes, as recommended for toxic substances with an elevated temperature.
