[68.155(a)]\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\n2.5.2 The stationary source and regulated substances handled? [68.155(b)]\r\n\r\nPropylene is the regulated substance that is managed at the Airgas North Central fill plant in Ankeny, IA.  Airgas North Central trucks pick up returned (empty) propylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propylene is stored at the stationary source in a large bulk tank.  Propylene is transferred from the propylene bulk tank into propylene cylinders.  The full propylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas North Central to customers.\r\n\r\n2.5.3 The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps? [68.155(c)]\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention processes that are specific to propylene and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n2.5.4 The five-year accident history? [68.155(d)]\r\n\r\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered process had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within"

Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 222 for additional information or if applicable, updated information.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.5.5 The emergency response program? [68.155(e)]\r\n\r\nEmployees of the stationary source will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 2280 and Appendix Tab 3120 for additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.5.6 Planned changes to improve safety? [68.155(f)]\r\n\r\nImplementation of the RMP processes produced many changes that improved safety.  Please refer to the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log for additional information.During the most recent Process Hazard Analysis review (November 11, 2011), which included a thorough review of process equipment and procedures, a number of action items were identified to improve the overall safety for this facility.  Future improvements will be summarized on the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log."
