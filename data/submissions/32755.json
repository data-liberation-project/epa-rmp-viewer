If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\nFacility Information\n\n?The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for retail sale to farmers.\n\n?Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n?The maximum quantity stored would be 265,200 lbs in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\n?The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n?There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n?Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n?The facility has:\n\n?A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910."
