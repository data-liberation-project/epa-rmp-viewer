CEPOC's practice is to\ndetermine appropriate administrative and mechanical controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances.  However, if a release were to occur, our response team members are well\ntrained to respond and control the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nCoastal Eagle Point Oil Company, located in Westville, New Jersey, operates a number of\ndifferent process functions to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, fuel oil, propane and\nbutane from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane,\nbutane and intermediate flammables.  In addition, the refinery uses chlorine,  which is also a\nregulated substance, for disinfection and treatment of process water at the refinery cooling towers. \nThe entire refinery has been classified as a single process, with multiple production units. This\nclassification ensures that all regulated chemicals that meet the criteria defined by the EPA are\nincluded in this program.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS   40 CFR 68.155(c)\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in the refinery is a catastrophic\nfailure of a one ton cylinder of chlorine.  Based on the criteria defined by the EPA, this scenario \nwould result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  Although we\nhave numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage t"

The covered process at the refinery that is regulated by the EPA RMP\nregulation is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119 and\nthe NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6). This summary\naddresses each of these elements and describes the management system in place to implement this\nprogram.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCoastal Eagle Point Oil Company involves employees in the programs developed to support\nprocess safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are included in every element\nof the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates.  They are\nmembers of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the\nsafety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training\nand contractor safety programs.  Employees have access to information created as part of this\naccident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident\nprevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that is maintained at the\nrefinery.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process\nsafety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include development and implementation of\nsystems to promote additional process and personal safety.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCoastal Eagle Point Oil Compan"
