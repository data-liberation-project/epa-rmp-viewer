The system operates at three-temperature separate suction pressures, all with single-stage compressors. The refrigeration system capacities are 128 tons of refrigeration (TR) @ -28 degrees F for the low temperature suction, 584 TR @ + 16 degrees F for the medium temperature suction and 183 TR @ +36 degrees for the high temperature suction. The refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulation system and is designed to operate at overfeed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Amhydrous ammonia (R-171) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw and reciprocating compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThis ammonia refrigeration facility system contains six interconnected sub-systems: \r\nLow temperaturere-circulating system(-28 degrees F @0.0 PSIG)\r\nMedium temperature re-circulating system (+16 degree F @29.4 PSIG)\r\nHigh temperature re-circulating system (+36 degrees F @ 52.9 PSIG)\r\nThermosyphon oil cooling system (95 degrees F @ 181.1 PSIG)\r\nCondenser system (95 degrees FCT / 73 degrees F W.B.)\r\nLow temperature compressor system (-28 degrees F @ 0.0 PSIG)\r\nMedium temperature compressor system (+16 degrees F @ 29.4 PSIG)\r\nHigh temperature compressor system (+36 degrees F BHP with one @52.9 PSIG)\r\n\r\nMajor equipment located inside the engine room includes: \r\nTwo low temperature compressors ( both Vilter model 601 / Screws @ 64 TR / 156 BHP with one compressor also piped to the medium temperature system - rating adjusted to 87 TR / 350 BHP). \r\nTwo medium temperature compressors (both Vilter model 751 Screws @292 TR/317 BHP with one compressor piped to the high temperature system - rating adjusted to 475 TR / 351 BHP).\r\nOne high temperature compressor (Vilter model 751 Screws @292 TR/ 317 /bhp with one compressor also pip"

Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed. P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step by step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOP's cover different phases of operations such as : initial start up normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns, and start up following a shutdown. \r\n\r\nTraining - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individuals role in the emergency response plan. \r\n\r\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process of the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process that contractors understand their responsiblilty and train their employees.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working order to prevent failure. These ongoing audits are a part of the preventative maintenance program in place since the initial operations began and are routinely performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. \r\n\r\nHot Work Permits -- This permit process is to protect against fire explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas). Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to in"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -- The risk Management Program is designed to comply with the EnvironmentalProtection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68. The stationary source is the Llano Distribution Center located at 5801 Martin Luther King Blvd, Lubbock, Texas 79404. The site is owned by Llano Logistics, Inc. The only PMR regulated substance at the facility is annhydrous Ammonia - classified as a toxic substance, liquified under presure. This facility has been in operation since May 2000. This refrigeration system at this facility will have an inventory or approximately 26,202 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 Level of compliance\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe facility has had two reportable quantity releases of anhydrous ammonia. \r\nThe first was on 4-4-2020 as a result of a failed solenoid valve on a liquid transfer line. Quantity of release was 863lbs. This release resulted in the evacuation of 50 people. Emergency Responders were contacted and isolated the leak. Nobody was injured and there was no environmental impact.\r\nThe second was on 6-29-2020 as a result of a failed solenoid valve on a liquid transfer line. Quantity of release was 591lbs. This release resulted in the evacuation of 120 people. Emergency Responders were contacted and isolated the leak. Nobody was injured and there was no environmental impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  -- This facility follows a stringent Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of Ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with the OSHA, Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY -- The facility has a comprehensive emergency response pl"

The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are some doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds and alarm and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air throgh the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentrations levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT \r\nThis hazard assessment was originally conducted to meet the RMP off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified as a toxic substance , liquified under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration as described in Chapter 4 : Off site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario used in this assessment identifies the most likely as the evaporator units (24 thru 39).  The worst case release scenario is ba"

While atttempting to add ammonia to the system the tank truck strikes the thermosyphon pilot receiver, the low, medium, and high temperature vessels causing a total release of ammonia vapor.   \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into the PSM Program to meet the EPA requirements for RMP. \r\n\r\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are involved have a greater degree of responsibility. The site maintenance department at the facility is keenly aware of the sense of resposibility for maintaining the integrity of the refrigeration system at the site. The awareness of the maintenance personnel will aid in every phase of the PSM program. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping . There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS , safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc. process information such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards., pressure safety relief settings , safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation, and process equipment information such as equipment specifications  electrical classfications, material of construction,installation manuals, operting and maintenance manuals and manufacturer's manuals.\r\n\r\nStandard Operation P"
