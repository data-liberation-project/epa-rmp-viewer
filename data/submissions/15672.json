The owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Coop Society are committed to teh prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authourities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2. The primary activity at the facility is the storage adn blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n3. The Worst-case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe Farmer's Coop Society has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for teh Storage adn handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety adn Health Asministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in teh past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or signigicant property damage at the facility;nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Farmer's Coop Society has:\n\nA written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR"

Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the Farmers Coop Society.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
