The plant, occupying approximately 6.3 acres, is a state-of-the art facility constructed in 1991, which uses an ammonia refrigeration system. The plant's vapor compression refrigeration system contains approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Columbus Foods acquired the plant in 2007 and has since made minor modifications to the refrigeration system.  The plant was previously owned and operated by Ito Cariani, Inc.  \n\nAccess to the manufacturing and office building is strictly controlled through locked doors and a security alarm system. The plant is located in the Eden Landing Industrial Park at the southeast corner of Corporate Avenue and Corporate Place.  The industrial park and surrounding area is used for light industrial manufacturing and commercial warehousing activities.  The Nimitz freeway (Highway 880) and the San Mateo Bridge are located approximately 1/2-mile from the facility.  The nearest body of water is the San Francisco Bay to the west.  Schools, hospitals and residences are located 1/4-mile to 1/2-mile east of the site.\n\nRegulated Substances and CalARP Program Levels\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) document has been prepared to satisfy Cal-ARP program requirements for the only covered process at the facility, the ammonia refrigeration system.

Therefore the facility is subject to the CalARP Program 3 requirements. The local administering agency (AA) for the CalARP Program is the HFD.\n\nProcess Description\nThis facility's primary refrigeration equipment consists of packaged plant components housed in a mechanical room.  The ancillary equipment includes piping, valves and evaporators located in drying rooms and storage rooms throughout the plant. The two-stage system is used to refrigerate several operations and areas at the plant.  Details of the mechanical compression refrigeration process are provided in the process flow diagrams (Appendix A) and in the main text of the report. The equipment includes a high pressure receiver, a low pressure receiver, five refrigeration compressors, an evaporative condenser, pumps, vessels, piping, control valves, pressure relief valves, regulators, control instrumentation, microprocessor-controller and alarms.  The condenser is located outside the building for heat rejection to the atmosphere. Part of the rejected heat is reclaimed through heat exchange with domestic hot water through a double-pipe heat exchanger (ammonia in inner pipe, water in outer pipe) located on the roof. The approximately 4,000-gallon high-pressure receiver is located outside the building on the southeast side (Figure 2).  Two 18,500-gallon emergency dump tanks with an ammonia diffuser system are located on the south side of the building.\n\nEngineering and Administrative Controls to Prevent Accidental Releases\nVarious engineering and administrative controls are in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The process can be manually shutdown using emergency switches located in the control room, compressor room and the front lobby.  The engineered and administrative controls include the following as described here and in Appen"

Bracing installed in 1990-1991 was designed to UBC 1988.\n2.\tVapor/Gas Suppression and Containment:  The mechanical room has self-closing, tight fitting doors that open outward.  There are no openings from the mechanical room that will allow ammonia to escape to other parts of the building.  The exhaust system fans can be activated from emergency switches located inside and outside the mechanical room.  Exhaust has been provided for the mechanical room separately, therefore, should a leak occur ammonia will be restricted to the mechanical room preventing entry to the rest of the building.\n3.\tOver or Under Pressure Controls:  If high pressure occurs a relief valve opens and ammonia is released at a predetermined safe rate (depending on device and vessel) until the pressure drops below the set point of the relief valve; the valve then reseals.\n4.\tOver or Under Temperature:  High temperature will result in high pressure within the system.  Relief valves will then release the overpressure (see Over or Under Pressure Controls).  \n5.\tGas or Vapor Detection:  An automatic ammonia leak detection and alarm system provides continuous gas/vapor monitoring capability.  A total of fifteen ammonia detectors are installed monitoring all rooms containing refrigeration evaporators (see Figure 2 for locations).  In the event of a leak audible and visual alarms are actuated when ammonia concentration reaches 30 ppm to alert plant personnel and the security company.

The release results assumed the following conditions for a WCS:\n\n\u00bf\tNeutrally buoyant gas.\n\u00bf\tTen-minute release at the rate of 1,200 pounds per minute.\n\u00bf\tUrban topography.\n\u00bf\tF stability class.\n\u00bf\tWind speed of 1.5 meters per second.\n\nModeling parameters are shown in Table 2 and results of the worst-case analysis are presented below.\n\u00bf\tUsing RMP Comp\u00ae with the worst-case meteorological conditions, the end point distance is estimated at approximately 1.2 miles from the facility (see RMP Comp\u00ae output in Appendix D).  The affected area is represented as a circle of radius 1.2 miles (Figure 3).\n\u00bf\tUsing 2000 census data from Land View 6, the estimated residential population within the worst-case radius is approximately 12,500.\n\u00bf\tAccording to Land View 6 census data, seven schools and one hospital are located within the worst-case circle at distances between 1/4-mile to 1.2-mile from the facility (Figure 3).  However upon checking with the Hayward Unified School District only six of the schools were found to exist. A list of these public receptors is presented as Table 3. Environmental receptors include the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (Land View 6).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\tThe ARS for the ammonia refrigeration system is a release of ammonia to the atmosphere from operation of a relief valve or rupture disk failure on the high-pressure receiver.  It was estimated that approximately 10 percent of the charge would be lost (RMPP 1991) based on relief valves sized to code requirements.  However, to be conservative, it was assumed that 25 percent of the ammonia charge (3,000 pounds) would be released at a rate of 53.3 pounds per minute (relief valve capacity).  \n\t\n\tThe results for the ARS were also generated using the EPA's RMP Comp\u00ae.

The affected area is represented as a circle of radius 500 feet (Figure 4).\n\u00bf\tUsing Land View 6, 2000 census data, no public receptors such as schools or hospitals were identified.  The residential population within a 500-foot circle was estimated at 0.  \n\nMitigating measures will act to limit the calculated distances for the WCS and ACS, although to be conservative no credit for mitigating measures was taken. Tall buildings, piping racks and surrounding equipment will act as a barrier and tend to passively mitigate the release should it occur.  For the ACS active mitigation measures such as pumping down the system would also limit and mitigate the release.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nColumbus Foods has developed a formal management system to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements.  This management system satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.6 of the CalARP regulation - and ensures that the risk management program elements will be developed and continually improved.  \n\nChemical specific prevention programs described in this RMP include an updated PHA, an updated OCA and a Prevention Program including all required prevention program elements (Program Level 3).  These elements include the following: Management System, Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps, Process Safety Information, PHA, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor Safety.  \n\nThe Five-Year Acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident History\nColumbus Foods compiled a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation. An estimated 20 pounds of ammonia were released on April 7, 2008 due to the operation of a relief valve.  The incident was reported to the HFD and the USEPA.  However, this release did not cause any offsite consequences as defined in the USEPA or CalARP regulations (evacuation, emergency response, injury or death).  The plant has not had any incidents that affected offsite receptors in the last 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nColumbus Foods has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that allows it to respond to any emergency.  The facility maintains a cooperative relationship with the HFD and relies upon the HFD for response to fires or hazardous materials emergencies. Plant personnel are trained in emergency evacuation. Designated employees will coordinate their efforts with the fire department, security company and ammonia plant vendors as necessary. Columbus Foods works closely with the HFD to prevent ammonia release or fires from occurring and to quickly mitigate either type of emergency.  Emergency evacuation drills will be conducted involving plant personnel and the HFD.  Mr. Hugh Murphy at (510) 583-4924 is Columbus Foods point of contact at the HFD.\n\nThe facility has a number of built in safeguards to prevent ammonia releases.  In the case of an ammonia release (concentration of 30 parts per million-ammonia) from inside the plant the following would occur:\n\u00bf\tAmmonia sensors from the network located throughout the plant would detect the release.  Audible and visual alarms would alert plant personnel, and the security company. \n\u00bf\tTrained employees will"

      "SummaryText": "initiate pump-down procedures. Ammonia will be pumped into the high-pressure receiver outside the building. The King valve and solenoid valves located on the refrigerant liquid supply lines would shut off, isolating the high pressure receiver and keeping ammonia from flowing into the plant.\n\u00bf\tRefrigerant liquid supply pumps to the entire plant would shut off, stopping flow of ammonia to the plant and the compressors.\n\nThe alarm panel is placed in the front lobby, with emergency shutdown switches and alarm locations clearly marked.  Trained employees are aware and can initiate manual shutdown or ammonia dump procedures with push buttons located on the front panel.  A first responder (HFD) also has the ability to shut down the ammonia plant or initiate an emergency dump from the front panel.  These procedures can also be initiated from the compressor room or the control room.  In the event of a fire all personnel will follow the ERP and evacuate the area.  Fire in the facility will activate the sprinkler system and automatically initiate the emergency dump procedure for ammonia.  Properly trained employees can respond to incipient fires requiring one fire extinguisher after notifying the fire department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes to improve safety were developed as a result of conducting the PHA.  ----- action items meeting the selection criteria were identified.  All these action items are in progress and scheduled for completion by their assigned due date."
