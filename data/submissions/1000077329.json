Headworks uses gaseous chlorine liquefied under pressure to disinfect the drinking water supply.  The Headworks facility qualifies for a Program Level 1 RMP based on the following three factors:  1) There are no offsite receptors within the area of the worst-case release scenario; 2) The facility has not had an accidental release resulting in offsite consequences; 3) Facility emergency response has been coordinated with local responders. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the Portland Water Bureau to handle and use chlorine and other chemicals in the safest way possible.  The Bureau has a comprehensive safety program that includes a proactive prevention program, comprehensive training for workers, neutralization/containment of accidental releases, and an Emergency Action Plan for notification of emergency responders and the community in the unlikely event of a chlorine release.  In addition, the Headworks facility is located in a remote area away from public receptors.  Considering these preventive measures, the benefits of drinking water disinfection (a safe supply of clean drinking water) greatly outweigh the minor risk of using chlorine at Headworks.  \r\n\r\nHeadworks Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Headworks chlorination system is located 5 miles behind a locked gate within the Bull Run Watershed, which is closed to public access.  The chlorination system consists of two separate rooms: a primary storage room and a secondary storage room.  A total of 36 one-ton (72,000 pounds) containers of chlorine are stored within these rooms.  Both rooms are served by an emergency air scrubber sys"

      "SummaryText": "tem, which when activated by automatic chlorine sensors, has the capacity to neutralize up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The emergency scrubber system has a back-up generator allowing it to operate even if electrical power to Headworks is interrupted.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau has implemented the substantial requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule at the Headworks facility.  This includes systematic evaluation of critical systems to prevent accidental releases.    \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau Headworks facility has no history of chlorine or other chemical release to offsite receptors that resulted in injury, evacuation, or sheltering in place (requiring residents to stay indoors).  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau has an Emergency Action Plan, which includes release response, emergency coordination, responder and community notification, hazard recognition, emergency equipment, evacuation procedures, and staff training.  The Bureau has two full time Emergency Managers who work closely with the State of Oregon's Fire Marshal Regional Hazmat Team #3. The Hazmat Team #3 is the First Responder and will provide emergency services to Headworks.  \r\n\r\nThe Headworks facility has remote chlorine release sensors that are monitored at an offsite Water Control Center.  The Water Control Center can activate emergency response to Headworks.  Emergency equipment that allows workers to respond to small incidents is maintained onsite.  All employees are trained in emergency response procedures and have a refresher training annually.  The facility is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Portland Water Bureau plans to continuously evaluate and improve safety procedures at Headworks as opportunities arise.  Training exercises will continue on a regular basis.  No major safety modifications to Headworks are currently plan"
