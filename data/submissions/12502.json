This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant, located near Evanston, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate from the plant inlet streams.  The Whitney Canyon Gas Plant also includes gas sweetening and sulfur recovery processes where the H2S and CO2 in the inlet gas is removed and the sulfur subsequently recovered for sales.  The Whitney Canyon Gas Plant has several regulated flammables from methane through pentane.  These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and  as essentially pure compounds.   Although the inlet stream to the Plant contains appreciable H2S (~17 % mol) the instantaneous mass of H2S available for release in any plant process is less than the 10,000 pound trigger for H2S coverage under the RMP rule.  There are no other regulated toxic compounds at the Whitney Canyon Gas Plant in appreciable quantities. \n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as \"Program 3\" under this Risk Management Plan and handled accordingly.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nToxic Release Scenarios\n\nThere are no regulated toxic compounds or processes at the Whitney Canyon Gas Plant in a mass great enough to trigger RMP coverage. \n\nFlammable Release Scenarios\n\nThe WCS associated with the release of flammable substances at the Whitney"

The regulated components of the mixed condensate are presumed to be instantaneously released, vaporized into an airborne cloud, and ignited in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) in conformance with the regulatory direction.  This is a very conservative scenario as the liquid released during any failure would be contained within the tank dikes as a pool with evaporation of hydrocarbons from the surface of the pool resulting in a much lower release rate and much smaller impact radius.  This scenario involves the release of 880,271 pounds of regulated flammables contained in the mixed condensate.  The EPAs RMP-Comp model was used with the default worst case meteorological conditions (F stability and 1.5 meters/sec wind speed) to determine maximum impact radius.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.8 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for control or mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nThe ARS for flammable substances was chosen to be the complete severing of a 2\" process pipe on the bottom (liquid portion) of the NGL storage bullet followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  A conservative assumption that the entire inventory was propane was made due to the models inability to handle mixtures in the alternative scenario mode.  Propane was chosen as the substance which has the greatest overpressure zone associated with this type of release.  The EPAs RMP-Comp model was used to determine the release rate of 13,700 lbs/min and the maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint.  Meteorological conditions used were those incorporated into the model as defaults for alternative scenario evaluation.  The release was assumed to persist for 25 minutes duration at the ini"

No control or mitigation actions were considered in evaluating this scenario.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHAs) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Pla"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Whitney Canyon Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Whitney Canyon Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Whitney Canyon Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark or ignition-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Whitney Canyon Gas Plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Whitney Canyon Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Whitney Canyon Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Whitney Canyon Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n\n7  Improve ventilation in HRU building.  Currently evaluating ventilation system.\n7 Design and install above ground, open drain system at inlet to eliminate corrosion problems.\n7 Install a 16\" valve on the reaction furnace vent line to eliminate process of swinging hot spectacle blind. \n7 Confirmation of PSV design and capabilities\n7 Review to include select remote valves on the preventive maintenance schedule\n7 Investigation/inspection of equipment based on visual observation\n7 Control venting of H2S through incinerator"
