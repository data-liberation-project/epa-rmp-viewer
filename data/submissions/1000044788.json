      "SummaryText": "This section reflects updated information that has been developed subsequent to the 2009 Risk Management Plans for this facility.  The purpose of acknowledging these changes is to provide a more accurate Risk Management Plan for use by the City of Lewisville for the five-year renewal commencing June 18, 2014, and for the following five-year period.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), under Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, and subsequently finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This rule established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP.  40 CFR Part 68 is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances. In compliance with the Risk Management Program requirements, Lewisville submitted Risk Management Plans (RMP's) to USEPA in June 1999, 2004 and 2009 for its water and wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nThe regulations require that these RMPs be resubmitted within five years following the initial submission of the plans.  In addition, while the resubmission is to reflect a general update of all sections of the risk management plans, specific elements of each plan, the Offsite Consequence Analysis and the Hazard Assessment, must be redeveloped prior to resubmission of the plans. Additionally, the regulations require that if any facilities are modified through improvements that change equipment, controls, or amount of chemical in use onsite, the risk management plans must be updated to reflect the changes. \n\nEffective April 9, 2004, EPA issued Changes to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) in 2004  as amendments to the original RMP regulations which require the following changes to be made to RMP programs, "

Changes in the practices for RMPs requiring submission of information on reportable chemical accidents within six months following the event of that accident\n\n2.    Changes in the practices for RMPs requiring the updating of emergency contacts information within 30 days of a change in that information\n\n3.    Removal of the reporting of worst case and alternative release scenarios in the Executive Summary\n\n4.    The addition of three additional pieces of information (data elements).\n\n\n\nThese changes have been incorporated into this Risk Management Plan update for the C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP for the City of Lewisville, Texas.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe C. R. Tommy Feaster Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The management of the C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP has complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and has established an Accidental Release Prevention Program that contains the following required information:\n\n?    A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n\n?    A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n\n?    A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n\n?    An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP facility in Lewisville Texas, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.  The emergency response po"

Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Lewisville Fire Department in case of an emergency. The plant staff will receive training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of either the City of Irving HAZMAT Team or the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team.  The City of Irving HAZMAT Team will respond to a major release while the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team will respond to a minor release.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP uses chlorine and ammonia as part of the disinfection process at the water treatment plant. \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP is located at 1400 N. Cowan Avenue in Lewisville, Texas, and draws its raw water supply from Lake Lewisville.  The raw water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  \n\n\n\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the C. R. Tommy Feaster WTP consists of an enclosed storage area, two vacuum regulators mounted to a manual switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves and drip lines, three flow proportionate feed chlorinators, and gas piping and ejectors. A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.  Chlorine is removed as a gas in a pressure feed system, however, the majority of the chlorine feed system is operated through a water injection induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing potential pressurized leaks along the feed lines.  In addition, the storage room is equipped with a scrubber, in order to neutralize possible leaks from the system.\n\n\n\nThe existing ammonia feed facility at the C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP consists of storage tanks, two manual feed ammoniators, and gas piping and ejectors. The potential to generate"

The USEPA requires that a single worst-case scenario for the facility and one alternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nA worst case release scenario was developed for this update.  However, in accordance with guidance from EPA's April 9, 2004 regulation modification to 2004 RMP updates, this information is intentionally omitted from this Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release scenario was developed for this update.  However, in accordance with guidance from EPA's April 9, 2004 regulation modification to 2004 RMP updates, this information is intentionally omitted from this Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine and ammonia equipment utilizing trained personnel in these areas.  C.R. Tommy Feaster WTP management enforces consistent operation through disciplinary action for operational deviations.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history for the C.R.

During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia had occurred.  \n\n\n\nPolicies were developed by the City of Lewisville that will cause a resubmission of the RMP within six months of the occurrence of a reportable chlorine release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Lewisville has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.
