KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sterlington Nitrogen Plant is one of several facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the facility, anhydrous ammonia is produced and injected into the main pipeline to be transported north to distribution terminals.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored at the facility until it is loaded on rail cars, trucks and barges for distribution.  \n\nThe facility consists of two ammonia production units, which use natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Sterlington Facility in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts"

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00b7Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Sterlington Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot.  \n\u00b7Providing an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia due to overpressurization.\n\u00b7Installing ammonia detectors at the property boundary to ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\u00b7Requiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and supply emergency air equipment in the control rooms.\n\u00b7Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnecte"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be North Monroe Hospital in Monroe, the Louisiana State Police, the U.S. Coast Guard, and Louisiana Power and Light.  The Sterlington Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
