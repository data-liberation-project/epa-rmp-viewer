DCP Midstream' policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases. If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan. \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe Mustang Gas Plant, located in Tuttle, Grady County, Oklahoma, is owned and operated by DCP Midstream. The Mustang Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that recovers hydrocarbon liquids from unprocessed natural gas. Two natural gas inlet streams (Low Pressure System) are delivered via pipeline to the plant. The recovered hydrocarbon liquids are transported via pipeline to fractionation plants for further processing and eventual sales. After processing, the residue gas from which the hydrocarbon liquids are recovered is delivered to a gas pipeline for eventual sales. The Mustang Gas Plant operation includes inlet gas separation, dehydration, cryogenic gas processing (recovery of natural gas liquids), product surge capacity, and compression.\n \nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Mustang"
