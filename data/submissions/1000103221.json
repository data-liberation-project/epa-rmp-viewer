The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs. Linde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care, Employee Health, and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde facility at Fresno, CA is an industrial gas plant that handles and/or stores industrial gases. The facility manufactures acetylene. Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility. The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of Calcium Carbide totes, a low-pressure acetylene generator, and a high-pressure cylinder filling area. \nAcetylene is compressed using generated acetylene from the process of manufacturing acetylene. The piping from the manifold runs to the generator and compressor room. The supply lines are equipped with flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2\" orifice plates, large flash arrestors, and check valves to protect against reverse flow.\nThe acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low-pressure acetylene generator. The low-pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas. The acetylene that is generated in the low-pressure generator is piped to"

The general accidental release prevention program:\nIn accordance with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management standard and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program rule, the Linde Fresno, California facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n - Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity.\n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review.\nLinde has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered processes at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\nAn incident alarm system that can be activated manually for evacuation purposes in case of a release.\n\n4.

Emergency Response Program:\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. Linde has established a Local Emergency Assistance Program (LEAP) to provide emergency response expertise for the unique industrial gas products and equipment we handle. All LEAP employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually. In addition, Linde has in place a detailed site and community emergency response plan that meets the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and EPA RMP 40 CFR 68.95. Linde employees will respond to most incidents involving toxic materials but may evacuate and coordinate with public first responders for major toxic incidents or for fire incidents.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \u0093Zero/Zero\u0094, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees."
