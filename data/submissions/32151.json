This manual gives the detailed requirement that must be taken by each facility to develop its safety program. The manual describes senior management's commitment to safety. The safety policy assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for conducting an effective safety program.\nThere is a written Corporate CHEMICAL HAZARD COMMUNICATION MANUAL. The manual describes how each facility is to develop its own local Hazard Communication program. The manual assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for developing an effective Hazard Communication program.\n\nOntonagon Mill Policy\nIt is the policy of Stone Container Corporation, Ontonagon, Michigan to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of CHLORINE or AMMONIA is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be reduced. To accomplish this the equipment associated with the chlorine and the ammonia systems are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices.  The operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine and ammonia systems have been trained in the safety requirements of the two materials.\n\nDescription of Ontonagon mill operation\nStone Container Corporation's Ontonagon facility produces corrugating medium on two paper machines.  The mill produces the pulp for the corrugating medium from recycle fiber and a carbonate-based semi-chemical pulping process. \n\nDescription of RMP Systems\nChlorine\nThe  mill has a high rate activated sludge wastewater treatment system. This wastewater treatment system is sensitive to stressors from the mill operations. Sometimes the stressors result in an imbalance in the microbiological system, generating filamentous organisms. These filaments in turn create poor settling in the final effluent. To control the filaments (settling r"

      "SummaryText": "ate) chlorine is required. Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders and is injected into the wastewater treatment process as needed to control the undesirable microorganisms.\n\nThe Ontonagon mill uses water from Lake Superior for all its process water needs. The intake water is treated with chlorine to prevent biological fouling of process equipment. Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders and is injected into the intake water as needed to prevent equipment fouling.\n There will be a maximum of five cylinders connected at any time. Four for the wastewater process and one for the intake water process. This number was determined by the need for chlorine. Each of the connected cylinders is a separate but identical process. There could be 20 cylinders (40,000 pounds) on site, connected and in storage, at a time. In this arrangement a problem as defined by the worst-case release scenario will only involve a single cylinder.\n\nAmmonia\nIn an activated sludge wastewater treatment system nutrients are required for the microorganisms to properly digest the contents of the waste stream. Nitrogen is one of the required nutrients and it is supplied to the process by feeding ammonia.\nThe storage tank has a total volume of 17,600 gallons. The maximum volume in the tank is controlled to 15,000 gallons of a 30 % solution of ammonia in water. \n\nWorst-case release scenario\nChlorine\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 2,000 pounds. There can, however, be five of these containers in service at a time. The arrangement is that each cylinder is a separate but identical process and a worst-case release of any one cylinder will not cause an effect on the other cylinders. This will result in the worst-case release of 2,000 pounds or 200 pounds per minute. \nThere are no administrative controls on chlorine inventory in use at the facility.\nThere are no passive control measures in place at the facility.\n\nAmmonia\nThe maximum quantity "

There are instructions to never fill the tank above the level of 15,000 gallons. Documentation of the ammonia tank level is recorded on the WWTP daily log sheet. There are instructions that the ammonia storage tank level must be below the 45-inch mark before ammonia is ordered. This level provides for the introduction of a full truckload of ammonia without exceeding the limit of 15,000 gallons (85 inch) control point.\nThe ammonia tank has a passive containment system around it. This passive containment system consist of a concrete wall that has a surface area of 1041 square feet and will contain all of the ammonia solution with an excess volume of 805 cubic feet\n\nAlternative release scenario\nChlorine\nA cylinder is in service with a regulator in place. The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off. This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder. Release quantity of chlorine will be 23.4 pounds or 0.39 pounds / minute and last for 60 minutes.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the chlorine system.  \n\nAmmonia\nThe hose used by the delivery truck to fill the ammonia tank breaks and releases the capacity of the truck pump. The amount of material released is 4145 pounds of solution or 1244 pounds of ammonia.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the ammonia system.  \nDuring a filling operation of the ammonia tank there is always a trained driver in attendance and would require only five minutes for the truck pump to be stopped and the valve closed. There will be a release to the atmosphere for 20 minutes from the puddle formed.\n\nFive-year accidental release history\nThere have been no RMP releases of Chlorine or A"

This PSM program meets the RMP requirements for a release prevention program. The Michigan Occupational Safety and health Adminstration conducted an audit of the mill's PSM program on May 12-14,1998. There were several recommendations and corrections suggested and all have been addressed. The PSM program was approved as meeting the PSM requirements, and was reciently updated on May 18, 2004.   \nAmmonia\nAn OSHA PSM program is not required for this process, as ammonia is not on the list of materials requiring a PSM program. The mill, however, has taken steps to use the knowledge and practices from the PSM program to insure the safety of its ammonia process.  \nThe operators are trained in ammonia safety and correct operating procedures. The operators conduct daily inspection rounds of the WWTP, including the ammonia system, to insure the WWTP is operating correctly.  Any concerns, including safety of the ammonia process, are reported to the maintenance department so corrections can be made.\nThe maintenance employees are trained in ammonia safety and how to complete the required work.     \n\nGeneral prevention activities\nThe mill has a staff of experienced and knowledgeable employees that receive refresher safety training on these systems at least every three years. Each employee working with chlorine or ammonia has experience in the proper use of personnel protective equipment. \nEmployees are trained in how to and do change chlorine cylinders as necessary and to check for and correct small leaks that occure during the cylinder changing process.If a leak can not be controled by closing the cylinder valve Village of Ontonagon's fire department hazardous materials (HAZMAT) team will be called to respond to the release. \n\nAny event involving a release of chlorine or ammonia is investigated and"

In the event of an emergency release which could have a possible offsite consequence from the release of chlorine or ammonia the Village of Ontonagon Fire Department will be notified by calling 911. The Ontonagon Fire Department has been informed of the storage of one ton cylinders of chlorine and the storage tank containing a 30% ammonia solution and they have a copy of this Risk Management Program.\nThese two sources, chlorine and ammonia, are known by and are a part of the Ontonagon County's, LEPC, community emergency response plan. The WWTP facility has been used, by the local fire departments Hazardous Response Team to train and test their response efforts.   \n\nThe village of Ontonagon Fire Department is the first call for help if there is a release of chlorine or ammonia and has the necessary equipment and training to respond to a worst-case release of chlorine or ammonia. The mill has provided equipment to the fire department to contain a release. Training exercises are conducted annually at the mill. The village fire department is a volunteer unit and many of the members are from the mill.\n\nPlanned improvements to improve safety.\nStone Container has implemented an environmental management system (EMS) to improve the effectiveness of the Ontonagon Mill's environmental programs. The EMS incorporates procedures for the operation of the wastewater treatment plant including the safe handling of chlorine and ammonia. Based on Stone Container's excellent compliance record and implemented EMS, the Ontonagon Mill achieved the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's \"Clean Corporate Citizen\" status in January 1998. The EMS is reviewed annually at a minimum to identify areas for continual improvement to the system and safety of employees."
