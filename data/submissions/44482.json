This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facilities processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* Emergency Response Programs\n\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant that is regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant is located in St. Mary parish, Louisiana.  The plant is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L. P.   \n\n\n\nThe Gas Plant is a cryogenic expander plant that extracts natural gas liquids from an inlet stream of production natural gas.  The plant rec"

The plant was recently expanded by the addition of a Train 2 which is included in this RMP report.\n\n\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  \n\n\n\nListed flammable substances that are stored above the threshold quantities at the Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant are natural gas liquids and natural gas.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the ARP program. \n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results  \n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary, but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances above the threshold quantity on site and there are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Enterprise Neptune Gas plant.  Because the processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, its operations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained."

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involved both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the tasks and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instruction or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) \n\n\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\n\n\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.
