KAAPA Ethanol, L.L.C corporate policies place the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.  The owners, management and employees of the KAAPA Ethanol facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous materials.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Kearney County Emergency Management (Local Emergency Planning Committee), and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the processing of grain into fuel-grade ethyl alcohol.  The ethyl alcohol manufacturing process involves the use of anhydrous ammonia and natural gasoline.  The natural gasoline is referred to as product denaturant and is used to make the ethyl alcohol unfit for human consumption.   \r\n\r\n3.\tFive-Year Accident History.  No accidents have occurred within the most recent five-year period. \r\n\r\n4.\tEmergency Response.  The emergency response program established by KAAPA Ethanol allows for personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances in the event the release can be controlled using KAAPA Ethanol personnel and equipment in the area.  KAAPA Ethanol has identified additional resources to assist in mitigation, control and disposal of a release.  The local emergency response agencies will be relied upon to inform the public about the release. KAAPA Ethanol has developed an Emergency Action Plan outlining actions taken in the event of an accidental release of regulated substances as well as in the event of natural disasters.  The Emergency Action Plan is provided below for reference.  \r\n\r\n5.\tKAAPA Ethanol has an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) in place to respond to prevent and respond to chemical spills on site.

KAAPA Ethanol, L.L.C. plant has implemented several environmental, emergency, and safety programs at the facility.  These plans are crucial in our everyday operation and procedures.  Daily, weekly, and monthly checks are completed that affect our ability to respond to emergencies, including a Health and Safety Plan.   Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) plans have been prepared and implemented, with updates completed as needed to ensure compliance and effectiveness.   All implementation is accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and time frames.  KAAPA Ethanol has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for a Program Level 3 facility.  The facility conducts weekly and monthly training as part of our normal activities.  Training consists of regulated safety requirements.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented in accordance to regulation.  Natural gasoline (denaturant) is a PSM-applicable chemical mixture on site.  The PSM program covers distillation tanks and piping, and storage tanks utilized for anhydrous ethanol and denatured ethyl alcohol.   Safety inspections are completed regularly, utilizing in-house and outside expertise to conduct.  Periodic reviews are completed on plans and procedures in place, with scheduling for additional training as part of the review process.  As previously mentioned in section 5 of this executive summary, KAAPA Ethanol implements an ERAP as part of the Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure requirement to prevent and respond to chemical spills on site. In addition, KAAPA Ethanol has a Facility Response Plan (FRP) to respond to chemical spills on site.
