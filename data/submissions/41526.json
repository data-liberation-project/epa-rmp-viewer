The facility\u00bfs history began in 1913 with the construction of a pioneer mill at the head of the York River.  In 1914, Chesapeake Pulp & Paper Company began making pulp, which was sold to other mills.  The Chesapeake Corporation was formed in 1918.  The West Point Mill was one of the first American mills to produce \u00bfKraft\u00bf pulp and paper.  St. Laurent Paper Products Corporation purchased the West Point Mill in 1997.  In 2001, Stone Container Corporation purchased the West Point Mill from St. Laurent Paper Products Corporation and continues to operate the mill.\n\nThe West Point Mill handles chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and aqueous ammonia (NH3), which are chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The Mill operates under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 2611 now recognized under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code"

      "SummaryText": "32211, one of nine highly hazardous SIC/NAICS codes.  In addition, these processes are subject to requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore the processes are subject to RMP Program 3 requirements.\n\nChlorine dioxide is manufactured on site for use in the bleach plant.  It is produced by combining sodium chlorate (NaClO3), methanol (CH3OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).  Sodium chlorate is reacted under certain conditions of acidity and temperature and with the addition of a reducing agent, chlorine dioxide is produced.  Mill production equipment can produce up to 25 tons per day of a 10 gram/liter chlorine dioxide solution, which is stored in three aboveground storage tanks.  These tanks have total capacities of 68,000 gallons, 120,000 gallons, and 145, 000 gallons.  Ammonia (aqueous, 24.5%) is purchased for use in the facility wastewater treatment plant.  A local supplier delivers ammonia to the site via tanker truck.  The ammonia is stored in a 15,600-gallon tank.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia on site is 29,000 pounds.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nA complex model, SLAB, developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, was used for realistic modeling results.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine dioxide would be the complete failure of the 145,000-gallon storage tank.  The results of SLAB modeling showed that the worst-case chlorine dioxide release would have an impact radius of 16.7 miles, for an impact area of 876 square miles.  This area has a population of approximately 48,000, and includes the following: portions of seven counties; West Point; Urbanna; Camp Peary; York River State Park; Mattaponi Indian Reservation, Pamunkey Indian Reservation; and State Prison Camp No. 16.  A more likely alternate release scenario for chlorine dioxide would have an impact radius of 0.18 miles and would have no public receptors.\n\nThe worst-case release sc"

The results of SLAB modeling showed that the worst-case aqueous ammonia release would not impact environmental or public receptors off-site.  The more likely release scenario also has no off-site public receptors.\n\nPollution Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) relating to the covered processes is divided into three categories:  chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI relating to the hazards is included in MSDS\u00bfs that are kept in readily accessible locations for all employees.  PSI relating to the process technology is generally indicated on process drawings, and is referenced in application Operating Procedures and Process Hazard Analyses.  PSI relating to process equipment is located in equipment files maintained by the Engineering and Maintenance Departments.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) will be conducted on each covered process every five years, or when the process changes.  PHAs for both the chlorine dioxide and ammonia processes were conducted in March 2003.  PHA will be conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at the minimum:  operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.  PHAs will address the hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents that had a likely potential for a catastrophic release, engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are maintained by the Department responsible for the process.  One copy of the Operating Procedures for the chlorine dioxide system is located in the Bleach Plant Control Room for ready access by the Bleach Plant Operators.  Operating Procedures on the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), and correspondingly the ammonia system, are located in the control room.  All SOP"
