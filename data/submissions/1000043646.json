It is the policy of Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or its neighboring community.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this policy, Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC. has developed and implemented OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management programs to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  The Risk Management program includes procedures: (1) to identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment and, thereby, help prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, and (3) for minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nSara Lee's Tarboro facility makes frozen bakery products for public consumption .  The major processes at the Tarboro facility include flour handling and storage, ingredient mixing, dough proofing, product baking, product packaging and distribution.  Raw materials are delivered to this facility by trucks.\r\n\r\nThe only RMP regulated chemical handled by Sara Lee Frozen Bakery. at the Tarboro facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for cooling, and freezing products.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.   Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by supplier tank trucks to initially charge the system and occasionally thereafter to top-off the system if needed, to replenish from periodic maintenance.  \r\n\r\nSara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC has in place policies that limit the amount of ammonia at the facility.

Under both of these programs, the facility has outlined specific procedures that it follows to prevent or minimize the release of anhydrous ammonia to the environment.  Specifically, the facility has performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the ammonia system and will repeat this process at least every 5 years.  The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system.  In addition, the facility performs regular training of its employees to ensure that the procedures developed for the safe use and handling of ammonia is adhered to all the time.  Finally, the facility has a regular inspection and maintenance program to ensure that the ammonia system is operated and maintained according to specific ammonia industry safety standards.  \r\nIt is Sara Lee Frozen Bakery's policy and belief that safe operating and maintenance practices and accident prevention programs are the key to obtaining safe operation and achieving accident prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSara Lee Frozen Bakery's Tarboro facility has had a reportable release of ammonia in the last five years.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC. has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release.

The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan that documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as notification of the local emergency response agencies that are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally The Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC. has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases. These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and functions. These personnel also receive initial training and annual update of training thereafter.   \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNo changes to The Sara Lee Frozen Bakery's ammonia refrigeration processes are planned at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements. Facility personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
