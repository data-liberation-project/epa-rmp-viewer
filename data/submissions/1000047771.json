      "SummaryText": "The Facility maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which contain a total of approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia: 18, 500 pounds in the South System and 7,500 pounds in the North System.  The systems are closed loops, and little or no ammonia is needed annually to replenish minor losses due to routine maintenance or to sustain a milk and nut cooler, a -10 degree F freezer unit, plant process water coolers, and Facility air conditioners.\n\n\n\nThe receiver tanks for both systems are equipped with both sight glasses and pressure gauges. The pressure relief valve setting on the tanks is 250 psig, and the vent is to the roof with an appropriate diffuser. The mechanical rooms where the receivers are located are equipped with ammonia sensors set at 50 ppm. The sensors trigger an audio alarm throughout the Plant. The sensors are replaced every 12 to 18 months. The sensors are calibrated every 30 days and the span is adjusted every 90 days.  At sounding the alarm, the system compressors are automatically shut down and the room exhaust fans are initiated. Ammonia within the room is exhausted to and through the roof. Shutdown allows the ammonia in the system to migrate to the cold spots within the system.  \n\n\n\nAlarm lights and/or sirens are located outside the north and south compressor rooms. At 30 parts per million (ppm) these alarms lights will activate to identify ammonia is present at or above 30 ppm. At 50 ppm, the general evacuation alarm sounds. Upon activation of the general evacuation alarm, employees are to assemble in the break room and wait for further instruction.  \n\n\n\nBoth refrigeration systems are visually inspected daily by the operators. In addition to the ammonia sensors, there are either equipment electric panel lights or computer monitoring readings for temperature, pressure and/or liquid level on all pressurized elements of the systems. Vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves vented to the roof of the building. An ammonia dump fire"

A fire hose can be affixed to the panel, and the ammonia charge can be dumped and mixed with water on discharge.  \n\n\n\nAn emergency action plan has been developed and has been coordinated with the Iola Fire Department. The Facility has an arrangement with the Iola Fire Department to provide response in emergencies.  The Fire Department has been made familiar with the Facility and the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\nRussell Stover has a proven record of safety to prevent releases, and has not has any release within the last five years that resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.  Russell Stover employees' utilize a professional approach to prevent accidents by improving operations, engineering, and training whenever possible.  Russell Stover is committed to continuously evaluate the ammonia refrigeration systems as required under the PSM and RMP process standards to ensure safe operations."
