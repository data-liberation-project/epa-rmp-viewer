      "SummaryText": "This is the risk management plan for the Poland Filter Plant, a water treatment facility owned and operated by Consumers Ohio Water Company.  Regulated chemical processes at this facility are limited to chlorine gas, which is used as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The facility is located at 7640 Youngstown-Pittsburgh Road in Poland, Ohio.  The facility typically stores between 4,000 and 6,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton cylinders.  Chlorine cylinders are stored in a separate room isolated from the rest of the plant.  The chlorine process involves meticulous operational and maintenance practices to minimize the risk of a chlorine release to the facility and its surrounding environment.  These practices include maintenance of the chlorine room's physical integrity, procedures for the loading and unloading of chlorine cylinders, for placing and removing cylinders from service, and in the operation of the chemical feed system.  Emergency response is coordinated with the Mahoning County Emergency Response Agency's HAZMAT response team."
