Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the Solvay Solexis Orange Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\n\nWe are a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Program.  The ACC Responsible Care Program goes beyond the boundaries of regulatory compliance and strives for continuous improvement in industry operations and processes by incorporating health, safety, and environmental protection into all stages of a products life A? design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.\n\nThe Orange plant participates in the Orange Community Advisory Panel of local citizens who meet regularly with plant management to discuss various issues, especially those related to environmental, safety, and health.  This mechanism was established to better understand and address the needs and concerns of the local community.\n\nSolvay Solexis has been proactive in communicating our risk management program with the community.  A RMP Community Awareness event was in public meetings during April of 1998 and included participation by local industry and the local emergency response community.  The Community Advisory Panel toured our plant and employees and management were available to answer questions.  Information was distributed that explains our plantA?s safety programs, release scenarios, and emergency response program.  The presentation to the general public was repeated during the communityA?s annual A?Gumbo Cook-Off FestivalA? on May 2,1998.\n\nThe following is taken from Solvay SolexisA? Corporate Safety Policy:\n\nSolvay Solexis, Inc. (A?Solvay SolexisA?) is committed to provid"

It is also the policy of Solvay Solexis that all our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Additionally, it is Solvay SolexisA? policy to supply all available information pertaining to safe handling and use of its materials to customers.\n\nThe following specific points are included in Solvay Solexis policy.\n\n-Solvay Solexis, in all its operations, is committed to achieving excellence in safety.  All other activities should be consistent with this goal.\n\n-Compliance with safety and environmental laws and regulations is our top priority.  No other operations will take priority over this objective.\n\n-It is Solvay SolexisA? premise that all accidents and injuries are preventable.  Therefore, every reasonable and practical effort will be made in the interest of preventing accidents that cause personal injury or property damage, both inside the corporation and outside.\n\n-Safety is the direct responsibility of all levels of line management and is an important measure of managerial performance.\n\nThe Orange Plant recognizes and is concerned that every employee shall be furnished a safe and healthful place to work, free from recognized hazards that might cause serious injuries and illness.  Every effort will be made in the interest of accident prevention, health preservation, and fire protection.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nSolvay Solexis has developed and currently markets a family of fluorine based products that are noted for their exceptional resistance to chemical agents and environments, which attack and degrade other materials.  At the Orange plant, various grades of HALAR&reg; are manufactured that are used by customers in a number of applications, including the formulation of wire and cable coatings. The Oran"

Trifluorochloroethylene is also known as chlorotrifluoroethylene, or CTFE. \n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety Management rules, which regulates the management of process safety.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents are kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  A comprehensive program ensures that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process or process change is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This is performed by a team, which identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when deemed necessary.\nStandard Operating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide clear daily instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process, consistent with the process safety information.  The written procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, emergency shutdown procedur"

This requires operators to demonstrate (through written testing and hands-on examinations) that they have adequate knowledge before they can work independently.  This training includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employeeA?s job tasks.  There is annual refresher training for all operators on the operating procedures and chemical hazards of the process.\nMechanical Integrity:  An established preventive maintenance and equipment integrity program promotes that all process equipment is operating within approved limits.  The initial and on-going integrity of process equipment is ensured by determining that the equipment is designed, installed and maintained properly.  This includes testing and inspection of equipment and quality assurance checks of equipment, spare parts and maintenance materials.  Any deficiencies, which are found, are required to be corrected before the equipment is returned to service.\nManagement of Change: A compliance program ensures that changes to equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), and operating procedures are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage the change and that existing controls have not been compromised by the modification.  All changes are verified with a pre-startup safety review, all relevant process safety information is updated, and all affected employees are notified of the change.\nPre-startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is performed for all modifications, which resulted in a change in the process safety information.  This review ensures that all construction and equipment is in accordance wit"

This is performed by an audit team of both hourly and management personnel.  All findings of the audit are promptly addressed and are tracked to ensure they have been corrected.\nIncident Investigation: All incidents are investigated and appropriate corrective actions are made to prevent recurrence. The investigations are conducted to determine the facts and develop recommendations, which are tracked to completion.  These are reviewed with all employees during monthly safety meetings, as well as any recommendations from our employee safety committee.\nEmployee Participation: Employees are encouraged to participate in all areas of process safety management, including the conduct and development of process hazard analysis and other process safety information.  The Employee Safety Committee meets once per month to review new information and address the concerns of the plant employees.\nHot Work Permit: A permit is required to be issued before any hot work operations can be performed on or near a processing area.  This ensures that all fire prevention and protection have been implemented and that employees in the area are aware of the activity.\nContractors:  All contractors working in the plant receive training on all facility rules and regulations, chemical/process hazards, and emergency procedures.
