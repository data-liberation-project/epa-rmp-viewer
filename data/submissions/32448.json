      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nGeneral\nThe City of Lebanon Authority (CLA) owns and operates a potable water treatment system and distribution system for the City of Lebanon, Pennsylvania and surrounding communities.  The water treatment plant located at 12 East Behney Street, Lebanon Pennsylvania, 17046 processes up to 10.0 million gallons of water per day.  It operates 24 hours per day throughout the year.    Raw water is drawn from Swatara Creek and Seigrist Dam.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, ahd chlorine disinfection.  This plan addresses chlorine used in the treatment process.  \n\nChlorine is stored in a room that may contain up to eight one ton cylinders (16,000 pounds) of liquid chlorine under pressure, a hoist, scales, vacuum regulators, and a gas detector/alarm system.  A chlorine feed room is located adjacent to the storage room and contains pre, post and spare chlorinators.  The system uses remote vacuum actuated eductors with the vacuum regulators located in the storage room.  The vacuum regulators are attached directly to the cylinder container valves mitigating against a high pressure release thru the chlorinators.  Water treatment plant operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the chlorine, rate of chlorine use, and adjusting feed rate as necessary.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention\nThe City of Lebanon Authority's water treatment plant accidental release and prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n1. High level of training for operators.\n2. Preventative maintenance program for equipment.\n3. Use of state-of-art process and safety equipment.\n4. Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.\n5. Performance of hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\n6. Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SC"

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills will be conducted with the fire companies.  The operation and response procedures will be reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nPlanned Facilities to Improve Safety\nFacilities to improve safety were made since the previous RMP submittal including additional signage and installation of a scrubber.  It is also recommended to provide a fire suppression system for the chlorine facilities.."
