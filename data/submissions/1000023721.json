      "SummaryText": "nse plan has been established with the Cambridge Fire Department.\n\nFive Year Accident History: There have been no reportable releases of formaldehyde at the Dodge Company since it began operations in 1893.\n\nEmergency Response Program: DODGE has a written emergency response plan which has been filed with the Cambridge Fire Department, who is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: DODGE conducted a process hazards analysis (PHA) for its production processes and warehouse operations in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation (29 CFR 1910.119). The PHA was based on a what-if question checklist developed through brainstorming and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that hazards of this process were thoroughly reviewed.  Hazards and applicable recommendations were developed and documented during the PHA.  The recommendations for engineering and administrative (E/A) controls for these scenarios and others identified are documented within the PHA What-If Checklist."
