      "SummaryText": "Exfluor Research is a specialty chemical manufacturer that specializes in fluorine chemistry. We have a process in which we directly fluorinate chemicals for pharmaceutical and industrial use. We use hydrogen fluoride (HF) to manufacture our fluorine that we then use to manufacture our chemicals. We manufacture our fluorine at the rate that we use the fluorine, so we do not have an excess of fluorine at our facility. We have 2 rooms for fluorine manufacturing. The HF flow is closely monitored and controlled. There will be no more than three 90 lb HF cylinders that will be manifolded together at one time. The HF cylinders are all open together on the manifold and pressure is controlled with heaters. The heater for the primary cylinder is always on to vaporize the HF. Once the HF pressure drops to a specified point, the heater for the secondary cylinder is turned on. Our fluorination reactors run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our main working hours are Monday - Friday from 8 am - 5 pm. All our fluorination reactors are controlled and monitored using National Instruments process control hardware and software. \n\n\n\nThe HF on site is in size A steel compressed gas cylinders and are always chained to prevent falling. All process piping is leak checked prior to use with HF. There is a HF monitor in each of the production rooms that will sense excess HF in the air. The alarms are maintained using National Instruments that is programmed to call the Emergency coordinators when the HF alarm senses 5 ppm. Normal operation at the facility does not detect any HF in the air. There have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nExfluor Research Corporation is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees, customers and visitors. The company shall follow operating practices that will safeguard employees, the public and company operations. Chemical manufacturing cannot be made risk-free, therefore, we will make every effort to prevent accidents a"

      "SummaryText": "nd comply with all established safety and health laws and regulations to mitigate all associated risks. We currently have 20 employees that work on the site and we have coordinated our response plan with the local Fire Department.\n\n\n\nExfluor follows the OSHA PSM and HAZWOPER regulations as well as the Emergency Response Plan. If there is a chemical release, the facility will be evacuated, and the Emergency Coordinators will assess the situation and determine if outside assistance will be required to help clean up the release. The EHS manager will then determine if the release is a reportable release and then contact the necessary agencies to report the incident. \n\n\n\nOur Emergency Coordinators are Luke Bernhard (EHS manager), Thomas Bierschenk (Vice President) and Kevin Bierschenk (Facility Manager). We will have 5 employees that will be 40-hour HAZWOPER trained, however until this happens, we will contract a hazardous waste cleaning company to facilitate our emergency response until we can handle our own response. We predict to be fully capable to handle our response by December 2020. \n\n"
