Casitas' policies include review and controls on process\n  design, operation and maintenance activities and procedures, emergency preparedness\n  plans and training programs.\n  \n     Casitas' approach to safety as stated in the company Injury and Illness Prevention\n  Program is as follows:\n  \n     It is the policy of Casitas Municipal Water District to strive for the highest safety and\n  health standards on all projects and work assignments.  Safety is the result of careful\n  attention to all District policies and procedures by all employees and management\n  personnel.\n  \n     Our safety program has been developed to assure compliance with federal, state,\n  and local regulations, with emphasis on the occupational safety and health act of 1970.  We\n  intend to prevent any human suffering as a result of accidents.  Prevention of injury is a goal\n  well worthy of our concern, diligence and job performance.\n  \n     Our employees have the right to a safe and healthful work environment.  They also\n  share the responsibility of working and acting in a safe manner.  Our safety policy can be\n  summarized into one sentence:\n  \n                    \"If it can't be done safely,\n                    we don't want you to do it.\"\n  \n     Casitas' three chlorination stations use chlorine gas liquefied under pressure to\n  disinfect the community's water supply.  Chlorine gas is drawn through piping under\n  vacuum to injectors where the chlorine gas is mixed with water and then the solution is\n  pumped into the pipeline.  The locations of the chlorination stations are as follows:\n  \n     Casitas #1 - The chlorination station located at the base of Casitas Dam is used to\n  inject chlorine into the pip"

Six of these one-ton containers are connected to the\n  dispensing system at any one time.\n  \n     Casitas #2 - The chlorination station located on the west side of Casitas Vista Road\n  approximately .75 miles southeast of Casitas Dam.  The facility is used to inject chlorine\n  into the pipeline supplying Casitas' distribution system.  Chlorine is brought to the facility in\n  one-ton containers.  Two of these one-ton containers are connected to the dispensing\n  system at any one time.\n  \n     Rincon - The chlorination station located on the south side of Casitas Pass Road,\n  approximately 0.9 miles west of Casitas Lake.  The station is used to inject chlorine into the\n  pipeline supplying the District's Rincon distribution system.  Chlorine is brought to the\n  facility in one-ton containers.  One of the one-ton containers is connected to the dispensing\n  system at any one time.\n  \n     The USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations require facilities with a\n  regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to prepare a formal Risk\n  Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The RMP consists of three\n  major components; a hazard assessment, a prevention program and an emergency action\n  plan.  Additionally Casitas is subject to OSHA Process safety management and emergency\n  action plan regulations, and State EPCRA laws.\n  \n     The hazard assessment portion of the RMP consists of assessment of hypothetical\n  and alternative scenarios for the release of chlorine.  The assessment includes dispersion\n  modeling, identification of the area where chlorine gas levels can be above specified toxic\n  end point criteria, and estimating potentially affected populations or sensitive environmental\n  areas.  To state it in simpler terms, the hazard assessment estimates the area of the\n  downwind chlorine gas migration in the event of an accidental rel"

The stream-valley topography surrounding Casitas #1 and #2\n  chlorination stations does not directly correspond to the \"rural\" or \"urban\" designations that\n  are used for modeling purposes.  Rural topography is characterized by a lack of buildings\n  or obstacles that would create air turbulence and mixing. Urban topography is\n  characterized by buildings or other obstacles (trees) that create turbulence and increase air\n  movement.  This increases atmospheric mixing and results in the computation of a lower\n  distance to toxic endpoint for a given release than rural topography would.  In Casitas'\n  situation, the trees and other obstacles increase air turbulence and mixing, but the stream\n  valley could confine a chlorine gas release and direct the release cloud downhill.  For this\n  reason, rural distances to endpoint were used instead of the relatively lower urban\n  distances when calculating the area of down wind gas migration.\n   \n     The required worst case release scenario is extremely unlikely due to the fact\n  that it specifies using the maximum amount of chlorine contained in one cylinder\n  (2000 lbs) to be released during a ten minute period.  The most likely cause for a\n  release of this magnitude would be a catastrophic event.  Regulatory agencies\n  recognize that the worst case scenario may represent a highly improbable scenario\n  which may not be appropriate for emergency planning.  The alternative scenarios\n  are those that are more credible and more appropriate for emergency planning.\n  The one-ton containers are stored in an enclosed building that would slow down the\n  release of chlorine gas.  The estimated distance of toxic levels of chlorine gas from\n  the chlorination stations was calculated from the EPA Risk Management Program\n  Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n  \n     The alternative scenario is a"

The alternative scenario\n  chosen for this analysis is the failure of the lowest fusible plug on the chlorine\n  cylinder, causing the release of liquid chlorine into the chlorination room.  This\n  scenario was chosen because it would result in a larger release quantity than a\n  chlorine gas leak near the top of the cylinder.  It is unlikely that a leak towards the\n  top of the cylinder would release the full amount in the cylinder.  The reason being\n  that if a leak occurs above the liquid level in a pressurized cylinder, the chemical\n  properties of chlorine (high vapor pressure and low boiling point) will cause frost to\n  form on the vessel in the area of the leak forming a barrier that stops the\n  vaporization.  Another safety feature that minimizes the likelihood of a major release\n  is that the chlorine gas piping from the cylinders to the injectors is operated under\n  vacuum. The chlorine injectors operate using the venturi principle, which generates\n  a vacuum in the chlorine gas line; this vacuum opens the valve to the chlorine\n  container, and allows the gas to flow.  Additional manual valves are used as flow\n  regulators.  If vacuum is lost (piping damage) the vacuum actuated flow valve will\n  close and this will stop the gas flow and isolate the chlorine container.  To further\n  enhance safety, the chlorination facilities are enclosed in concrete block buildings\n  that would slow the release of chlorine to the surrounding environment.  This is\n  termed passive mitigation, and was accounted for when calculating release\n  scenarios.  Offsite impacts were predicted from both the worst case and alternative\n  release scenarios.\n  \n     To ensure an immediate response by district personne"

The purpose\n  of Casitas' Emergency Action Plan is to minimize the duration and effects of an\n  accidental release of chlorine.  For minor releases where there is clearly no potential\n  for safety or health hazard, the release will be controlled by the employees and will\n  be considered an incidental release.  If a release is progressing so that a hazard is\n  imminent, the event must be considered a release and the Emergency Action Plan\n  will be initiated.  The Emergency Action Plan includes Casitas in the community\n  emergency response plan, and specifies the appropriate mechanisms for notifying\n  emergency responders.  The Emergency Action Plan includes specific actions to be\n  taken in response to releases of chlorine such as notification of the Plant Supervisor\n  or Chief Operator, and notification to the Office of Emergency services (OES).  OES\n  will in turn notify the County of Ventura Environmental Health Department.  If it\n  becomes necessary, Ventura County Fire Department and Ventura County Sheriffs\n  Office will be notified to handle evacuations, but during an extreme emergency\n  saving lives is more important than procedure.\n  \n  Casitas is pleased to report that at all three chlorination Stations there have not\n  been any events during the previous five years that had any potential for generating\n  a significant accidental release.
