The RMP conforms to the legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n-Describe existing safety systems at the Chester facility that are designed to protect employees, community, environment, and the facility.\n-Share information with the Chester Community about plant operations, including steps taken to minimize risk from handling of regulated substances.\n-Comply with the applicable EPA regulations:  40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following executive summary presents an overview of the Chester facility's accident prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY:\n\nAt Synthomer, safety, health and environment (SHE) is a core value.  As a part of the Synthomer organization we embrace Synthomer's Core Values, SHE Principles and Golden Rules.  Synthomer has introduced 10 SHE Principles and 10 Golden Rules across all sites to directly target and improve the safe operation of our plants. The SHE principles are:\n\nLook after yourself\nLook after each other\nEffective last line of defense\nStop and think\nSafe workplace\nSafe vehicle, safe driver\nSafe processes and operations\nSafe systems of work\nNo change without assessment\nLearning from our mistakes\n\nAs a member of the American Chemistry Council, Synthomer embraces the principles of Responsible Care, the chemical industry's commitment to continual improvement health, occupational, process and product safety and environmental performance. We manage all aspects of our activities so that we provide high levels of protection for employees, customers, the public and other stakeholders, and for the environment.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED PROCESSES:\n\nSynthomer Inc. Chester Plant has two regulated processes.  One process uses 50% Formaldehyde Solution (49% Water) in the production of water-based permanent press finishing resins for the"

The other process uses Vinyl Acetate Monomer to produce water-based emulsion polymers for textile, construction, paint, adhesives, floor care and paper industries.  \n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe EPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information for all accidental releases from regulated processes that resulted in (1) deaths, injuries according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on site, or, (2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nNo accidents meeting this regulatory definition have occurred at the Chester facility within the last five years.\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nSynthomer is committed to operating safe plants and safeguarding the communities in which we operate. The Chester facility began a formal Process Safety Management Program in 1992 when OSHA promulgated \u00a729 CFR 1910.119.  Process Safety Management in concert with effective engineering design, Employee Safety Programs, American Chemical Council's Responsible Care Program, and Emergency Response Programs make up the Chester facility's Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe following is a partial list of activities performed at the facility that are intended to prevent emergency situations from occurring or, in the unlikely event of an emergency, being prepared to respond quickly.\n\n-Active participation in the Chester County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n-Financial support of local emergency responders\n-Regular mechanical integrity inspections and testing of equipment\n-Identification and mitigation of hazards through Process Safety Programs\n-Testing alarms and safety systems to ensure they function properly\n-Ongoing employee safety training and drills\n-Onsite emergency response personnel\n-Contractor safety evaluations\n-24-Hour security\n-Internal and third party audits of our Responsible Care Management System\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nSynthome"

      "SummaryText": "r's' overall safety efforts consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials, as well as programs to mitigate the effects of a release should it occur.  Synthomer has a trained and equipped emergency response team capable of handling foreseeable emergency situations.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility. \n\nCoordination with local emergency response agencies is a key element of Synthomer's emergency response planning process.  Synthomer is an active participant in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Synthomer also supports local emergency agencies with grants through the Synthomer Foundation.  Continued participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee, training and drills will sustain and improve emergency response capabilities.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe site's SHE Improvement plan includes initiatives to drive improvement in the areas of Safety, Health, Environment & Security.  These initiatives include: Awareness and Exposure Reduction, SHE Culture, Risk Management, Business Integration of SHE Processes, Social Responsibility and Security.  The facility's Annual Operating Plan includes goals and objectives in these strategic areas to drive continual improvement of our safety, health, environmental and security practices."
