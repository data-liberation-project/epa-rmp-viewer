The Plant is on a property covering 65 acres. RVWTP is provided State Project water stored in Castaic Lake. The plant is capable of treating 30 million gallons of water per day. Raw water is first delivered to the pre-ozone contactor where ozone is applied for pre-oxidation and pre-disinfection. Ozonated water then enters the rapid mix structure where coagulants are added. The water is then fed to up-flow clarifiers, and then to a gravity filtration system. In the final stage, filtered water is disinfected with chlorine, monitored for chlorine residual, and released to CLWA\u00bfs transmission system for distribution. Potentially hazardous chemicals that are stored and used onsite or for which storage is available include chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, diesel fuel, liquefied oxygen, and sodium hydroxide. Liquid chlorine, used for disinfection of water, is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the plant is 16 cylinders (32,000 pounds). Chlorine is present in quantities above the RMP threshold. The other chemicals are either not covered under the RMP program, or are present in quantities below the thresholds.\r\n \r\nChemicals Subject to EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Program CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program. Chlorine for use in disinfection operations is delivered to the plant by truck and stored onsite in one-ton cylinders. Accidental Releases During Past Five Years The CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.
