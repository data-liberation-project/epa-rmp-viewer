      "SummaryText": "and Safety Committee is responsible for implementation of this policy.\n\nMerrimack Station has incorporated the program elements from the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation 29CFR 1910.119 into the routine operation of our facility as the foundation of an accidental release prevention program.  The station maintains an Emergency Response Plan that will be activated in the event of an emergency involving a regulated substance.  Merrimack Station is included in the local emergency response plan and our ERP is reviewed with the Bow Fire Department.\n\nB. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nMerrimack Station is a fossil fueled electric power generating facility owned and operated by Public Service of New Hampshire, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities of Berlin, CT.\n\nThe purpose of this facility is to generate electric power for sale via transmission and distribution lines to customers.  There are four separate units with a net claimed capacity of 478 megawatts.  Units 1 & 2 use coal fired cyclone boilers to produce steam that powers turbine driven generators capable of 113.5 and 320 megawatts respectively.  Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) form during the combustion process.\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction Technology (SCR) was installed in 1995 on Unit 2 and in 1999 on Unit 1 to remove the NOx as part of the PSNH plan to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  The application of SCR reduces NOx air emissions from the station in excess of 80%.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the reagent used in the process.  Ammonia vapor is added to the flue gas ahead of the catalyst bed where it combines with the NOx to form nitrogen gas and water vapor.\n\nC. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS. \n\nThe ammonia storage and handling facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The ammonia systems were designed and constructed with"

      "SummaryText": "ANSI K61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia guidance.  The storage tanks are built to the ASME Pressure Vessel Code for Unfired Vessels.\n\nOur accident prevention program is based on the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan which is a 13 point program for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases.  The Plan includes: routine maintenance and inspections, operating procedures, employee training in the hazards and handling of ammonia, and provides for periodic program audits.\n \nAll employees who operate ammonia equipment are trained in the hazards of ammonia.  Shift operators conduct rounds that include observations of the ammonia systems.  The storage and unloading facility is inspected as each rail car is unloaded.  Trouble reports are submitted when action is required and qualified mechanics are on site to make repairs.  Pressure vessels are inspected according to the ASME and NACE guidelines.  A management of change process is followed for qualifying modifications to the covered processes.\n\nD. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMerrimack Station went into commercial operation in 1960.  The first use of anhydrous ammonia on site was in 1991.  There have been no reportable releases of ammonia or related impacts from the use of ammonia to the health and safety of employees or the surrounding community.\n\nE. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) provides guidance to employees in the event of any emergency at the station.  The primary contact during any emergency is the on-duty shift supervisor who is available on site 24/7.  There are 5 shift supervisors who work on rotating shifts.  Since the RMP only allows space for one contact person, the Station Manager was listed.  The ERP includes procedures for notifying the local response agencies as required under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA).  The plan is submitted to and periodically reviewed with the Bow"

The BFD and the Central NH Hazmat Team are consulted in planning and conducting emergency response drills.\n \nAccess to the site is restricted to employees and authorized contractors.  Early warning systems include ammonia gas detectors that are strategically placed around the equipment.  Emergency response equipment is available on site. \n\nF. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNortheast Utilities and Merrimack Station are committed to providing a safe work environment.  The following items will be initiated as part of the ongoing program to ensure safety:\n\n* Provide annual refresher training to Hazardous Waste Operator/ Emergency Response Technicians to maintain their status at the 24 hour technician level.\n\n* Perform non-destructive examination (NDE) on the ammonia storage tanks following a regular schedule.\n\n* Outfit each storage tank with new isolation, excess flow and pressure relief valves following inspection and before return to service.\n\n* Implement the recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation conducted in May 2009."
