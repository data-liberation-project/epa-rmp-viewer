      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Dominion Transmission, Inc. - Hastings Extraction Plant\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDominion Transmission, Inc. - Hastings Extraction Plant (HEP) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the equipment at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Dominion has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, Dominion will contact the Wetzel County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nHEP processes natural gas by cleaning and dehydrating it prior to introducing it to a turbo-expander where the heavier hydrocarbons are liquefied.  The resulting product, natural gas liquid (NGL), is then separated into its constituent parts by fractionation, which are marketable as fuels or chemical feedstock.  There are four regulated flammable substances present in the flammable mixture (NGL) produced by HEP which include propane, butane, pentane, and isobutane [propane, 2-methyl].  Propane, butane, and isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] are transported to storage for distribution to end users. Pentane and heavier hydrocarbons are a component of natural gasoline which is transported to storage for distribution to end users offsite.  Flammable mixtures are subject to the rule when one or more regulated substances are present in the mixture above one percent and the entire mixture meets "

      "SummaryText": "NFPA-4 criteria. Propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane are all regulated substances present in the NGL product above one percent and is a flammable mixture that meets NFPA-4 criteria.  Thus, the NGL product is a regulated substance under the rule. (Natural gasoline does not meet NFPA-4 criteria and is therefore not a regulated substance under the rule.)\n\n\n\nThe NGL product is stored onsite in one of three storage tanks (spheres).  Two spheres have a useable capacity of approximately 840,000 pounds each.  The third and newest storage sphere (T-3) has a useable capacity of approximately 1,200,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of the flammable mixture in all three spheres is approximately 2,900,000 pounds.  No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under Part 68 of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  HEP also maintains an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nHEP maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheet"

The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors or importers to provide SDSs, formerly MSDSs, to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products.  As of June 1, 2015, the HCS will require new SDSs to be in uniform format.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards are identified and controlled efficiently. HEP primarily uses the HAZOP method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of at least every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within a covered process, HEP maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nHEP develops and implements safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nHEP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training is "

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work in HEP, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances within HEP, the safe work procedures insisted on by Dominion, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures used at the HEP.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information includes evacuation routes and assembly points.  HEP will document that the contractor has received and understands the training.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe process components at the HEP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-regulated process at the HEP.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  The HEP has safety features on many units to help (a) prevent a release (process control); (b) contain/control a release (e.g., diking); (c) quickly detect a release (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms), and (d) reduce the consequences (mitigate) of a release (e.g., fire suppression and extinguishing).\n\n\n\n4.
