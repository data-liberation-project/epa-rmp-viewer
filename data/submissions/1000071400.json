This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training of personnel and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes at CRNF. CRNF implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. CRNF places emphasis on prevention prompt detection and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release. \n\n\n\n\n\n2  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nCRNF operates a variety of processes to produce anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions. Regulated substances held in RMP covered processes above the threshold quantity include anhydrous ammonia and flammable mixture of hydrogen, methane, and carbonyl sulfide (carbon oxysulfide). The facility includes a total of six (6) RMP covered processes, subject to Program 3 requirements. The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nCRNF has implemented an accidental release prevention program. The accidental release prevention program required for Program 3 processes is summarized as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the facility's accident prevention program is a critical component of the overall objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of a flammable or toxic substance.

Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning employees, contractors and the public.\n\n\n\nCRNF strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through, for example, regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, hazard communications, safety suggestions, incident reporting system, and special training programs such as emergency response training and first aid training. CRNF actively seeks employee involvement in the development and implementation of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate programs. Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions, if necessary. Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective accident prevention program, as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis. The process safety information is readily available to all employees and used by facility personnel, the process hazard analysis team, and persons in charge of updating the emergency response plan. CRNF maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nCRNF also maintains numerous technical documents "

This information includes, but is not limited to, materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nCRNF has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of facility personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and may include third parties. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed. Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change at the facility. Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe facility "

Operating procedures are reviewed periodically and as operational changes are introduced and annually certified as current and accurate. Both operators and technical staff participate in the review and certification process.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures provide current, clearly written instructions for operating the processes. Instructions include applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications. Operating procedures ensure that all employees operate the processes in a prescribed, consistent, and safe manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nCRNF has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the processes at the facility. New employees receive training in process operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nCRNF uses contractors to supplement its workforce and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site-specific safety rules; and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.
