      "SummaryText": "1.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n1.1 Source\n\nThe Huisken Meat Sauk Rapids facility in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota is subject to the US EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for beef processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high-pressure receiver that operates at 200 psig and can contain as much as 12,642 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only 8,500 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Sauk Rapids facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The low side (i.e., low pressure) is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side (i.e., high pressure) is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves (SRVs), engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  SRVs protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, accumulators, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with over-pressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.\n\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two specifically de"

      "SummaryText": "fined release scenarios (a worst-case related and an alternative-case release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 150 parts per million in air, or 0.015 percent.  The release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the US EPA?s Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA 5.3].\n \n\n2.1 Worst-case release\n\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the largest vessel and associated piping (approximately 11,631 pounds of ammonia) over an 11-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the ?ALOHA Plan? and assuming the facility is located in a rural area, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release extends beyond the facility boundary.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high-pressure receiver are such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel?s condition occur every other year by the facilities insurance company inspector as required by state guidelines.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure).  Because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high-pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs"

The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the Internal Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n?The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessels;\n?The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel;\n?Main ammonia shut-offs have been labeled to allow personnel to stop the flow of ammonia quickly in an emergency.\n \n\n2.2 Alternative-case release\n\nThe alternative scenario is considered to be defined by a release of ammonia that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\nThe ?ALOHA Plan? scenario was used for this analysis, which assumes a release of ammonia through a 3/8-inch effective diameter hole in the largest vessel (i.e., 200 psig), releasing 62.3 pounds of ammonia per minute.  Using the specified meteorology contained in the ?ALOHA Plan?, the distance to the endpoint for the ?more likely? release scenario extends beyond the facility boundary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n?Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n?The facility has a full alarm sprinkler system throughout the plant which is also heat activated;\n?Ammonia detectors exist in the entire engine room, which would detect a leak quickly;\n?The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system; and\n?The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel.\n\n3.0 PREVENTION PRO"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention programs are summarized below:\n\n?The development of an employee participation program, which includes Sauk Rapids facility employees from all areas within the plant.\n?The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n?The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a ?HAZOP? Protection Analysis.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated in the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n?Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n?Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.
