This commitment is demonstrated by our dedication of staff and resources to our accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and self audits.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Bear Creek Water Treatment Facility uses chlorine for disinfection in the treatment of water before distribution.  The facility is coordinated with Jackson County Government Department of Emergency Services and the South Jackson County Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to repond to a catastrophic release of chlorine.\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant.  The 2,000-lb container is the largest chlorine storage vessel on-site and all of the containers are located in an enclosed building, with a scrubber system that draws in contaminated air upon chlorine gas detection above 3 parts per million for treatment.  The Bear Creek Water Treatment Facility did not have reportable accidental releases in the previous five-year period.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements because the facility is operated by private contractor employees, which are subject to Federal OSHA regulations.  The elements in the program include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors.  Addressing the requirements of each element provides the foundation of the facility's accidental release prevention program.  The program is integrated into the operation of the chlorination system by the facility's Plant Manager and operations and maintena"
