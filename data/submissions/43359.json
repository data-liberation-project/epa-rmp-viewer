We have built this plant according to all Federal, State, and Local requirements and with strict compliance to NFPA #58 and #70 specifications.  We are committed to our employees, the public and the environment to operate our facility in a safe manner.\n\n1.  When we designed our Oklahoma plant all of the requirements of NFPA #58 to control an accidental release were built into it.  We have always strived to keep up with the changing regulations for the product that we handle and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemical release.\n\n2.  Technical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety.  Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee exposure and injury.  We have a emergency response policy in effect at this facility with a copy on file with Emergency Management of Ponca City.  To comply with RMP regulations we have updated them to include written instructions to alert our employees, the Emergency Management of Ponca City and required responders in case of an emergency.  We have also included safe distances, places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures.\n\n3.  Technical Propellants, Inc. of Ponca City is located in Kay County of Oklahoma.  The office building is located 650 feet off the road.  The tank farm consist of 7 steel ASME pressure tanks that contain our products and is located Southeast of the office building.  We are a manufacturer of aerosol propellants.  We receive raw LPG:ie-Propane, Isobutane, and Butane into our plant by tank trucks.  We process these products through molecular sieves that takes out the impurities in the gas.  It is then stored in tanks for shipment.  Per our customers specifications we load these products by themselves "
