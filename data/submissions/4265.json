Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Woodbridge Corporation as part of the Woodbridge Group of companies, believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, should be of the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n*Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\n*Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety, & environmental improvements.\n\nOur complete Health Safety and Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility.\n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program.  To ensure that our program is appropriately developed and implemented, Our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, and is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Woodbridge Corporation is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry.  The foam is made by high-pressure injection of chemicals into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously moving line.  The mold moves through a curing"

Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's RMP rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam  TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck.  It is stored in two tanks in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, adn contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 30,085 gallons.\n\n3.  Off-site consequence analysis scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint was the OCA table as established by the RMP rule.  The Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) was used to determine modeling parameters.  Meteorlogical conditions of 99 degrees F at 68% relative humidity were used based on climatological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  An urban environment was assumed due to the characteristics of the local terrain.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nOur worst case scenario was determined to be a catastrophic failure of a railcar full of TDI at the railsiding, discharging its entire contents of 190,000 pounds.  It is assumed that the maximum temperature the TDI could reach during an unload is 95 degrees F.  As there is no containment at the railsiding, it is assumed that a pool with a depth of 1 cm is formed and evaporated to form a cloud that disperses downwind.  The distance to the endpoi"

No residential population will be affected by this worst-case scenario event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA rupture of the 15-ft, 2-inch flexible hose at the tanker truck offloading station would trigger a 483-gallon release of TDI.  One of the operators would manually shut off the flow to limit the loss of material.  The liquid would remain within the diked area.  The pool would form a toxic cloud that disperses downwind.  The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L. is 10.9 yards.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary, but would not impact any residential population.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\nSafety Information\nHazard Reviews of our processes\nOperating procedures\nTraining\nEquipment Maintenance Program\nRMP Compliance Audits\n\nAccident/Incident Investigation\n\nIn addition, we have established an Isocyanate Control Program that outlines the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls in place to reduce the hazards of isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community, and the environment.  Those listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.

The emergency response program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We have coordinated our program with the local emergency planning committee and the fire department.  A representative of the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to resond to a release of TDI.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAt this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety managment systems.  In addition, we are scheduling improvements to our off-loading systems to prevent th loss of TDI during routine off-loading procedures, with the target date being September 1999.  We also anticipate improving our training program in the area of specific maintenance tasks."
