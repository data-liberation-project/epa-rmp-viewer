Nevertheless, Rio Grande Juice Company continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Rio Grande Juice Company\u2019s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Rio Grande Juice Company\u2019s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nRio Grande Juice Company has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nFor the future, Rio Grande Juice Company now thinks of the"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nRio Grande Juice Company has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nRio Grande Juice Company\u2019s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\n- U.S. Occupational Safety"
