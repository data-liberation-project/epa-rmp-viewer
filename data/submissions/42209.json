      "SummaryText": "THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn this facility, we use anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA. This chemical must be used to provide cooling for the process and the areas.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions in handling these substances and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nSOURCES AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Nestle R&D Center's manufacturing facility is in the business of researching and developing foods; such as, coffees, candies, soups and ice creams for their corporation.  These products are cooled by evaporators and heat exchangers during the process.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant used for cooling due to the low cost of the medium and the low temperatures that must be obtained.  The ammonia is enclosed within a closed loop that removes heat from the products and storage rooms.  Ammonia is vaporized in evaporator coils by heat removed from the products and cooling areas at low temperatures and pressures and then the heat is transferred from the system to the atmosphere by moving outside air and water over condenser coils.\n\nThe ammonia system at the Nestle R&D Center contains up to 17,500 pounds of ammonia.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARDS\n\nHealth Hazards:\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with extremely pungent odor.  Liquid ammonia vaporizes to a poisonous gas cloud.\n\nAmmonia is a severe irritant of the eyes.  It penetrates the eyes more readily than any other alkali.  Contact with liquid anhydrous ammonia and concentrat"

      "SummaryText": "ed solutions can produce severe eye injury or blindness.  Exposure of the eyes to high gas concentrations can cause temporary blindness and severe eye damage.  Laceration or watering of the eyes can occur upon exposure to 150 ppm ammonia gas and higher.\n\nAmmonia is an irritant by inhalation.  At increasing concentrations it can cause symptoms ranging from runny nose, coughing, chest pain, trouble with breathing, and death.  It can cause severe breathing difficulties that are delayed in onset.  Inhalation of concentrations of 2500 to 6500 ppm causes shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chest pain, and pulmonary edema (filling of the lungs with fluid) that may be fatal.\n\nExposure of the skin to liquid anhydrous ammonia or high concentrations of the gas can cause first and second degree burns of the skin.  Vapor concentrations of 10,000 ppm are mildly irritating to moist skin, while 30,000 ppm or greater causes a stinging sensation and can produce skin burns and blisters.  These high concentrations of ammonia are corrosive to moist skin and other moist body tissues.\n\nPhysical Hazards:\n\nAmmonia or ammonia with oil or other debris is an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or fire.  The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is 16% and Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) is 25% by volume in air.  Elevated temperatures can cause containers of the substance to explode.  Ammonia emits toxic fumes when exposed to heat.  When heated to temperatures above 850\u00b0F, ammonia will emit hydrogen gas.  The auto ignition temperature is 1204\u00b0F if catalyzed by iron.\n\nAmmonia can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with halogens (e.g., chlorine, bromine).  It can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with strong oxidizers, hypochlorite bleaches, silver compounds, mercury compounds, gold, other metals, and acids.\n\nCommon Exposure Control Methods\n-   Process enclosure\n-   Local exhaust ventilation\n-   General dilution ventilation\n-   Personal protective equipment\n-   Use of"

      "SummaryText": "water\n-   Area monitoring (with alarm systems)\n\nPotential for Exposure to Ammonia\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed system with no purposeful exposure to ammonia.  As a closed system, exposure potentials are primarily related to equipment failure, fugitive emissions from improperly adjusted or worn valve packing, failure of pump and compressor seals and pipe connector gaskets, or mistakes in operation of the system. \n\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nNestle R&D Center has been in operation since 1996.  There have been no incidents of sufficient severity to qualify for inclusion in the RMP Five Year Accident History.   \n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Nestle R&D Center complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Preventative Rule with all applicable state codes and regulations for ammonia and propane.  Management systems are in place to administer the RMP prevention programs for ammonia. The Section Leader is the responsible person for leading this program.\n\nThe Nestle R&D Center is in compliance with OSHA's PSM rule for ammonia.  The RMP's accidental release prevention program for ammonia is covered by the elements of the PSM program.  Controls for the prevention programs are achieved by:\n\n-   Effective preventative maintenance programs\n-   Reviews for proper design\n-   Development of and following operating procedures\n-   A mechanical integrity program that includes equipment testing procedures\n-   Training to be aware of potential exposure situations and using exposure prevention procedures and/or protective equipment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is equal to the IIAR's Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration.  An emergency response plan is in place at the Nestle R&D Center to deal with incidents and emergencies that might take place on site.  The site maintains it's own HAZMAT teams.  Training for these functions is given annually per state requirements.  Onsite drills are also sch"

The plan has been provided to, and reviewed with the Union County Local Emergency Planner Center.  Coordination with the LEPC has been made to notify them through the emergency response plan to respond to incidents that may affect the public.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNestle R&D Center is continuing to improve and update the employee training program to enhance awareness for all employees, as well as contractors, and increase the skills and qualifications of our refrigeration operators to increase their abilities to respond to emergencies.  This ongoing training includes offsite refrigeration training courses, operating procedure reviews and drills."
