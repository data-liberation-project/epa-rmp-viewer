The tanks are stored in an enclosure and chlorine deliveries are performed with the vendor's truck inside the storage area with all windows and doors closed during the fill.  Because the truck is parked inside the enclosure during the delivery, the building was considered as a passive mitigation measure.  Therefore, the release rate to the atmosphere is 2,200 pounds per minute.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for a release of 2,500 lbs./min.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors and environmental receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from a 1 inch hole or open pipeline.  The release rate of chlorine due to this hole was calculated as 864 pounds per minute.  It was recommended during the HAZOP study to perform an off-site consequence analysis with the scrubber not operating.  Consequently, passive mitigation measures were incorporated.  The release rate after this mitigation was calculated to be 475 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table, Exhibit 4-12, from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for a release of 500 lbs./min.

The emergency response plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the RMP document.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCity of Escondido Water Treatment Plant's Superintendent is the designated emergency coordinator for the plant.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which was implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the plant.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe chlorine system at City of Escondido Water Treatment Plant is used for disinfecting potable water before it is distributed.  Chlorine is stored in two 25 ton container in the chlorine storage room.  Administrative controls are in place such that no more than 80% of chlorine can be added to a storage tank during delivery.  Therefore, each storage tank is filled to 20 tons each.  Chlorine is withdrawn under pressure and directed as a gas to one of the five (5) chlorinators or as a liquid to an evaporator (2).  The evaporator will convert the chlorine from a liquid to a gas.  The chlorine gas from the evaporator or storage tank will be kept under vacuum (using vacuum regulators) and be directed to one of the five chlorinators.  The chlorinators will be used to control the chlorine feed rate needed to disinfect the water supply.  The metered chlorine will pass from each chlorinator to a dedicated chlorine injector which will dissolve the chlorine gas into the water supply.\n\nChlorine is the regulated substance at this facility.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at"

      "SummaryText": "EPS\n\nThe chlorine system at the City of Escondido Water Treatment Plant was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  All of these codes serve to reduce the risk within the facility by specifying acceptable design criteria for the chlorine system and on-site buildings.  In addition, the facility was designed in accordance with industry standards and with generally accepted engineering practices.  City of Escondido Water Treatment Plant has established a mechanical integrity program for maintaining and operating the chlorine equipment and uses the Chlorine Manual from the Chlorine Institute as a basis.\n\nThe system is designed with chlorine detection alarms throughout the chlorination building.  All chlorine detection alarms are set at 0.5 ppm.  Ventilation louvers to the affected area open automatically. At the second alarm level (3 ppm), the pneumatic valves on the storage tanks automatically close.  Also at this level, the ventilation louvers and system close and the system shuts down to contain the gas within either the storage room or evaporator room depending where the leak occurred.  The caustic scrubber system is activated at this level of leak as well.  The scrubber continues to operate until it is shut-off manually at the scrubber containment area.  The scrubber is capable of neutralizing 25 tons of chlorine.  Emergency shutdown switches are located at the control panel in the main control room, the PLC in the operations building control panel, and upstairs by the tank valves next to exit door.  If there is a power failure, the pneumatic valves will close because air pressure is lost.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe chlorine treatment system (chlorine in bulk 25 ton storage containers) commenced operations in March of 1999.  Since that time there have been no releases of chlorine.  Prior to the startup of the 25 t"

      "SummaryText": "on system, a system that used one ton containers was operated at the same facility.  This previous chlorine system had a small chlorine leak on April 7, 1995.  An operator had noticed a chlorine odor coming from one of the tanks that had been removed from service.  (The leak was not strong enough to be detected by the chlorine sensor in the room.)  This tank had already  depleted chlorine by the water treatment system and was shut off at 30 psi.  Two Escondido Operators attempted to tighten the leaking valve, but were unsuccessful due to the valve's deteriorated state.  The chlorine tank was then moved outside of the chlorine facility doors and rotated so the leaking valve was on the gas side of the tank.\n\nImperial West Chemical Company was then called to come and repair or cap the leak.  The fire department was also notified at this time.  The Imperial West team replaced the valve cap and tightened the packing nut.  The leak was stopped.  The tank bonnet was installed and the tank was shipped back to the supplier.  The chlorine release was estimated to be less than one pound.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment (Off-Site Consequence Analysis) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the City of Escondido Water Treatment Plant facility located at 3440 East Valley Parkway in the city of Escondido, Ca1ifornia.  A Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study was performed on the chlorine system at 10%, 80%, and 100% of the design stage phases.  Mitigation measures have been completed, are near completion, or no longer apply to the 100% design stage.  On April 23, 1999 a thorough review of these migitation measures was conducted and the following recommendations remain:\n\nDevelop written delivery procedures and a written checklist for delivery of the bulk chlorine.  The Water Treatment Plant would like to note that procedures are present and are being corrected with delivery drive"

A video camera at the lower entrance gate and a communication system will be available.  The Water Treatment Plant would like to note that the driver is checked in and escorted to the building and that additional cameras will be added.\n\nDetailed maintenance procedures will have to be written and implemented.  The Water Treatment Plant would like to note that this recommendation is in progress.  A computerized maintenance system is being created by Montgomery/Watson which will prompt operators for maintenance activities.\n\nSuggestions and comments were taken from operators during a training session on April 23, 1999.  The Treatment Plant would like to note that they have taken these into consideration to ensure safe operations at the plant.  In response to these suggestions, the treatment plant is planning on installing portable eyewash stations within the chlorinator, evaporator, and compressor rooms.  The treatment plant has also supplied portable radio for operators for easier communication during deliveries and emergencies.  An additional safety shower is also being considered to be installed to the rear of the building for easier access.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant plans to have a joint exercise with the San Diego County's Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT) and the City of Escondido's Fire Department.  An exercise of a mock release is planned to occur by late August."
