Facility staff works closely with other city and county agencies to coordinate safety and emergency response training activities. The TRFP uses chlorine, a regulated substance, in 1-ton cylinders to purify drinking water for the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  In 1998 the facility installed a new, state-of-the-art, chlorine containment system and has subsequently won a national award from the City-County Communications & Marketing Association for its computerized operating procedures.\n\nChlorine cylinders are used and stored inside the Chlorine Storage Building where chlorine sensors continuously monitor air in the building.  If sensors detect chlorine above 1 ppm, a blower is automatically turned on which exhausts building air through the emergency chlorine scrubber and an alarm is activated alerting plant personnel to a possible chlorine leak.  The emergency chlorine scrubber system contains 22 tons of CHLOROSORB\u00e2, an activated alumina material which absorbs and neutralizes chlorine.  The scrubber system is capable of effectively removing over 1 ton of chlorine (the contents of one overfilled cylinder).  The scrubber system is also capable of handling air containing up to 100% chlorine gas and discharges on a continuous basis at less than 0.005 ppm chlorine concentration.  The TRFP regularly submits samples of scrubber media to the supplier to monitor its depletion rate and replaces the media as recommended.\n\nIn the Chlorine Storage Building liquid chlorine is converted to chlorine gas.  Before leaving the Chlorine Storage Building chlorine gas is piped through two vacuum controlled valves in series which control the flow of chlorine gas throughout the rest of the chlorination process.  A loss of vacuum in the process lines due to a leak or other equipment malfunction automatically closes both vacuum controlled valve"

The two valves in series provide safety backup, if one should fail to close.\n\nThe TRFP has safely chlorinated the City of Wayne water for decades without incident.  The facility continues evaluating ways to improve the safety of this chlorine system.\n\nThe facility is covered by the Allen County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) community emergency response plan and has procedures for notifying local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release of chlorine."
