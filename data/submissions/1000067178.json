      "SummaryText": "Facility Information\n\n\n\nREC Silicon Butte, Montana facility is a manufacturer of silane, silane derivatives and polycrystalline silicon.  The facility has been operating for approximately 20 years at the time of this plan submittal.  REC occupies a 250-acre plot, which is located aproximately 7 miles southwest of Butte, Montana on Rick Jones Way.  The facility is located in an industrial park and the surrounding property is uncultivated land.\n\n\n\nProcess Overview \n\n\n\nThe REC Silicon facility in Butte, MT is comprised of four different production units: 1) Silane, 2) Poly Reaction, 3) Product Finishing, and 4) Specialty Gas.  \n\nThe Silane Unit, through a series of chemical reactions and separation steps, converts metallurgical silicon, silicon tetrachloride and hydrogen to high purity silane gas.  Intermediates produced in the silane unit are trichlorosilane, dichlorosilane, monochlorosilane and disilane.  Some of the silane and intermediate products will be packaged in cylinders or tube trailers and temporarily stored prior to sale.  The Poly Reaction Unit uses the majority of the silane and converts it into hydrogen and polycrystalline silicon.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Silane Unit and the polycrystalline silicon is forwarded to the Product Finishing Unit for processing and packaging. \n\nAs defined by the RMP regulations the Butte facility is a covered process.  This process includes the Silane and Poly Reaction production areas which are interconnected and the silane module storage area which will be adjacent to the Silane production area.  Together these areas are identified as the Polysilicon Manufacturing Process.                                                                                                                                                                                  \n\nREC Silicon's risk management plan uses \"predictive filing\" to account for variables in the total quantities of chemicals at the facility, and for planned changes t"

With predictive filing, the maximum quantity of chemicals that would be in the process at any one time is specified in this plan.\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemicals:\n\n \n\nREC Silicon has identified the following chemicals and maximum on-site quantities, which trigger compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) standards, 40 CFR Part 68:\n\n\n\nSilane - 330,000 pounds\n\nTrichlorosilane - 310,000 pounds\n\nDichlorosilane - 130,000 pounds\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) - 19,800 pounds \n\n\n\nProgram Level\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations define three program levels based on processes' relative potential for public impacts and the level of effort needed to prevent accidents.  These levels range from Level 1 (lowest potential) to Level 3 (greatest potential).  REC Silicon's process falls under Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nA worst-case scenario for each RMP listed chemical was analyzed according to requirements in the risk management regulations.  Public receptors (residences) have been identified as lying within the OCA endpoints. \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years REC Silicon has not experienced any accidental releases causing specific offsite impacts as defined by the RMP standards. \n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nREC Silicon's accidental release prevention program is based on the following essential elements: \n\nHazard reviews of equipment and processes, preventative and predictive maintenance programs, a management of change program, operator job certification and performance testing, accurate operating procedures, internal and external auditing and inspection programs, accident and near-miss investigations, etc.  Advanced process monitoring and control systems are in use at the facility, and critical parameters are monitored with duplicate instrumentation.  Loss of utilities is protected against through the use of installed and routinely tested back-up systems.  Engineering and design standards ensure materials and equipment meet indu"

The program includes information on locations, quantities, and associated hazards of materials at the facility, as well as fixed and portable methods for containment and/or suppression of spills and releases, internal and external notification and communications procedures, alarm systems and evacuation plans.  The facility itself is designed with numerous mitigating features, including containment and diking, deluge systems for fire and vapor suppression, strategically-placed fire hydrants and fire monitors, and emergency scrubber systems.  Automatic and manual shutdown systems as well as automatic isolation valves are in place.  Back-up firewater pumps are installed.  Emergency equipment is routinely maintained and tested.  In addition, REC maintains a highly skilled emergency response team on-site 24-hours a day.  The emergency response team performs realistic monthly drills and exercises, covering a variety of response scenarios such as spill containment and cleanup, vapor suppression, firefighting, and response to injuries.  The emergency response team attends professional fire-fighting training to stay current with fire-fighting techniques. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nREC Silicon continues to seek and identify opportunities to improve safety through process hazard analyses, safety reviews and inspections, internal and external audits, incident and near-miss investigations, employee and safety committee suggestions, etc.   As a result of these activities, safety improvement opportunities have been identified that resulted in RMP program revisions and facility changes to improve safety.\n\n"
