Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMontana Refining Company (MRC) recognizes that, because of the complexity of its operation and the hazardous substances handled, there are potential hazards to employees and the public.  It is for this reason MRC is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the development and implementation of a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MRC to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances so that the health and safety of employees and the surrounding community is maintained.\n\nMontana Refining has employees at the refinery that are trained in emergency response to effectively respond to incidents involving hazardous substances.  Montana Refining invites local health care providers, including hospitals and ambulance services, to attend awareness seminars on some of the hazardous chemicals present at the facility, and has provided the local hospital with information on hazardous chemicals to aid in the treatment of exposures to these chemicals.  \n\nThe Company is represented on the Cascade County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and supports the LEPC in emergency planning efforts for responding to a release of a regulated or otherwise hazardous substance.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMontana Refining Company operates a 10,000-barrel per day refinery in Great Falls, Montana that contains various processes used to refine crude oil into various grades of motor gasoline, diesel fuels, jet fuels, and asphalt products.  There are 12 substances regulated under the Risk Management Program rule present in covered processes at the facility, as follo"

Process safety information is readily available to all employees overseeing or maintaining processes, and is updated based upon the results of hazard analyses, as well as employee participation.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMontana Refining Company periodically conducts a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on each process covered under the RMP rule to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled appropriately and effectively.  The methodology used to conduct each PHA is the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis, supplemented by Checklists.  Both methodologies are approved and effective means of identifying hazards within processes.  The analyses of each covered process are undertaken by a"

Process safety information is updated accordingly.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to significant modifications in existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at Montana Refining Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are adequate for the safe startup and operation of the new or modified process.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nMontana Refining Company conducts audits on a regular basis to evaluate compliance with the provisions set out under the RMP rule to verify that procedures and practices developed or implemented under the rule are adequate and are being followed.  These audits are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMontana Refining Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause(s) of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMontana Refining Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Malfunctioning equipment is repaired or replaced promptly.  \n\nIn order to provide an effective and coordinated response, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the City of Great Falls Fire Department, who may be called upon to provide assistance in emergency response.  The refinery is included in the Cascade County Emergency Operations Plan under a hazardous materials annex.\n\nIn September 2006, MRC participated in a functional A?table-topA? exercise in conjunction with the Cascade County Local Emergency Planning Committee and local emergency responders consisting of a mock off-site release of hydrofluoric acid from the refinery and an exercise of the response by MRC and emergency responders.  Items covered in the exercise included the establishment of a joint incident command center, traffic control, evacuation/shelter-in-place considerations, and the capabilities of the responding agencies.  At least one additional exercise of a more comprehensive nature is planned for the future.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nImproving process safety is an important goal of Montana Refining Company.  At any given time, numerous recommendations from process hazard analyses for improving process safety are being evaluated and/or implemented.  Planned changes include, but are not limited to, improvements in release prevention and detection systems, and updated procedures.  Observations made outside of process hazard analyses also alert MRC to areas where process safety may be improved. \n\nIt is important to note that the implementation of the accidental release prevention program is an on-going process, and Mon"
