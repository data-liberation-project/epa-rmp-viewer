Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in heating and grain drying.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) varies by location:\n\n                   Tank Size (gallons)                      Pounds at 85 % full\nProcess 5 - Storage Tanks\n                      12,000 gal                                         52,530 lbs\n                     12,000 gal                                          52,530 lbs\n\nProcess 6 - Nurse tanks\n                   32 @ 1,000                                          140,000 lbs\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 52,530 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent of its 12,000 gallon capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of 200 PPM) is 2.0 miles at the location with the largest storage.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a tran"

Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves,  relief valves, barries, manual and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage valves and hose end valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines in the ANSI Standards.  When repairs are necessary to valves or pumps, a professional contractor is hired. \n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually,  whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questions.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training include;  safety, operating procedure for plant startup, plant shutdown, filling a  nurse tank, unloading a transport,  emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shutdown.\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nWestern Iowa Coop, Mapleton Iowa  has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n-\n6.The Emergency Response Program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency,  it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.
