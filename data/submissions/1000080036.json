These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serving as a local sponsor for federal water projects, and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA's defined territory that includes all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles. \n\n\n\nTRA's greatest impact to the general public is ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  TRA provides essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is TRA's duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  \n\n\n\nTRA's Ten Mile Creek Regional Wastewater System (TMCRWS) went into service in 1970.  This advanced wastewater collection and treatment facility provides service for an 85 square mile area in southern Dallas and northern Ellis counties and provides services to the cities of Cedar Hill, Duncanville, DeSoto, Lancaster and Ferris.  The facility is located on 100 acres of land in a rural area a short distance from Ferris and has gone through three expansion phases since it went into service in 1970.  The facility currently has the capacity to treat in excess of twenty million gallons per day and has long been recognized by both state and federal regulatory agencies as one of the best wastewater treatment systems in the state.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the TMCRWS is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 2 due to the quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that it uses in i"
