These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serving as a local sponsor for federal water projects, and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA's defined territory that includes all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles. \r\n\r\nTRA's greatest impact to the general public is ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  TRA provides essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is TRA's duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  \r\n\r\nTRA's Ten Mile Creek Regional Wastewater System (TMCRWS) went into service in 1970.  This advanced wastewater collection and treatment facility provides service for an 85 square mile area in southern Dallas and northern Ellis counties and provides services to the cities of Cedar Hill, Duncanville, DeSoto, Lancaster and Ferris.  The facility is located on 100 acres of land in a rural area a short distance from Ferris and has gone through three expansion phases since it went into service in 1970.  The facility currently has the capacity to treat in excess of twenty million gallons per day and has long been recognized by both state and federal regulatory agencies as one of the best wastewater treatment systems in the state.\r\n\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the TMCRWS is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 2 due to the quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that it uses in i"

In developing its RMP, TMCRWS has conducted an analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental release including a worst-case and alternative case release scenario.  In addition, the facility has compiled a five-year accidental release history, a release prevention program for a Program Level 2 process and an emergency response program.  The TMCRWS has an outstanding safety record and there have been no accidents related to the chlorine or sulfur dioxide process in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nTMCRWS places the highest emphasis on safety and hazard prevention.  To this end, we have developed a comprehensive prevention program that includes the following key points:\r\n\r\n- Annual training is required by all operations and maintenance employees who work in and around hazardous chemical storage and loading areas.\r\n\r\n- Visual inspections of these covered processes are conducted by operations personnel on each shift.\r\n\r\n- Sensors and alarms are in place around all process areas to detect any leakage of the hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\n- Written operating procedures are continuously updated and maintained for operations personnel to use during their work routines.\r\n\r\n- All accidents are investigated promptly with written documentation of all findings.  These accident investigations are reviewed by management and Certified Safety Professionals to determine cause and prevention.\r\n\r\n- Monthly safety audits are conducted of all plant process areas including covered process areas.  Written documentation of these monthly audits, including actions taken to correct problems, is maintained for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\n- Preventative maintenance programs for covered processes are in place and a computerized records management system is in place to automatically generate reports regarding preventative maintenance needs and/or histories on all covered process equipment. \r\n\r\n- Project personnel on various safety issues that are pertinen"
