      "SummaryText": "The Ogden City Water Treatment Plan is located at 916 Ogden Canyon near the base of Pineview Dam.  The entire treatment complex was rehabilitated, including the construction of a new pre-treatment building in 1997.  The treatment plant has had a well-established and effective safety program with an outstanding safety record for more than thirty-two years.\n\nThe Ogden City Water Treatment Plant is a seasonally operated water treatment facility.  The normal operating season is May into October.  This time frame may vary depending on the demand placed on the distribution system due to an early spring or a late summer. During the treatment process, chlorine gas is used in the plant effluent water only for disinfections before it is put into the distribution system.  Chlorine gas is also used to treat our well water during the off-season before it is introduced to the distribution system at the treatment plant.  The chlorine treated water is supplied to the residents of Ogden Canyon as well as the residents of Ogden City.  A portion of this water is also sold to Bona Vista, a private water company.  The chlorine tank storage room will handle six, one-ton cylinders and is located next to the chlorine feed room.  There is a scrubber installed that will pull from both of these rooms in the event of a release.  This facility is manned twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week during the operating season and eight hours a day the rest of the year.  An alarm system is connected to audible and visual alarms on the outside of the building as well as to the computer monitoring equipment and an auto-dialer that will notify predetermined operators by phone of the alarm condition.\n\nAll operators are required to follow safety pocedures put in place.  Annually, we attend an eight hour refresher course.  We review and revise, if needed, the procedures in handling chlorine.  Each operator has his/her own personal protective gear.            We inspect and review the use of these during "

Leak detection and monitoring equipment has been installed in the storage and feed areas of the plant.\n\nThe Ogden City Fire Department HAZMAT Team is designated first responder to any accidental releases of chlorine gas at the Filter Plant.  This includes having them review our existing operation, equipment and training to give us help with additional strategies as well as keeping them familiar with our facilities layout.\n\nA study was conducted in order to determine the offsite effect of chlorine gas release for two different scenarios, one being a worst-case release scenario with the criteria for this release being determined by the EPA.  The alternative release scenario and the criteria for this release is to be based on a more realistic daily operation type of accidental release.\n\nIn each of the afore mentioned release scenarios, the toxic endpoint of the freed chlorine gas must be defined and calculated.  In conducting this drill or test the population of the affected area must be estimated to help in developing the evacuation plan.  The first response to the release will be from the Ogden City Fire Department.  Then if the evacuation plan is put into action, the Utah Highway Patrol, Weber County Sheriff's Department and Ogden City Police Department will assist.\n\nThe worst-case scenario that the EPA chose for the Ogden City Water Utility Treatment Plant was a complete gas release of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The predetermined conditions of the release are as follows:\nA. The releaser of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas in 10 minutes.\nB.
