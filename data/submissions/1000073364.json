In addition, we are committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the emergency response procedures necessary to mitigate a release quickly and effectively if it does occur. Employees and management meet regularly to discuss ongoing operations, potential problems, and continuous improvements to prevent releases from occurring. Trained emergency response personnel will respond immediately to any release or potential release, evaluate the situation, and determine the need to call outside emergency responders.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas facility is located at 6775 Central Avenue in Newark, California, which is approximately 1.1 miles southwest of Interstate 880.  The facility stores cylinders of compressed specialty/industrial gas in both large and small quantities. The cylinders vary from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas, depending on the size of the cylinder and the type of chemical packaged.  The cylinders remain at their respective storage location until purchased by a customer.\n\n\n\nThere are 10 chemicals in 15 processes at the Matheson Tri-Gas Newark facility that are regulated under the Federal RMP Program.  All regulated processes consist of cylinder storage only.  The detailed applicability of all chemicals, including inventory levels, is listed in the on-site California RMP (CalARP) documentation. The processes regulated under the federal RMP regulations can be summarized as follows:\n\n  \n\nChemical ------ Process\n\n\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 7 NH3 Storage\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 5 NH3 Storage\n\nArsine ----- Bldg 7 AsH3 Cylinder Storage\n\nArsine "

This system monitors the presence of various toxic and flammable gases in areas where those gases are stored. Two-stage alarms are set for each sensor. The low-level alarm alerts the facility that a problem may be developing. The high-level alarm triggers an evacuation of the building and provides notification to the Fire Department. The system provides real time readouts of gas concentrations and records all information. This information assists in preventing and mitigating gas releases.  \n\n\n\nAdherence to objective equipment standards: One of the most significant contributors to the prevention of accidental releases at this site is the high standard to which all gas cylinders must be manufactured. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) each have detailed requirements for the storage and handling of cylinders. Cylinders must be manufactured according to a particular metallurgical standard and be able to handle an increase in pressure, an increase in temperature, and the possibility that the cylinder will be hit or fall over.     \n\n\n\nProcess hazard analysis: Process hazard analys"

Recommendations are generated if the controls are found to be inadequate or non-existent.  These recommendations are then scheduled as process improvements. \n\n\n\nDevelopment and implementation of standard operating procedures: There is a system established for creating, reviewing, and maintaining operating procedures.  Written procedures have been established for the safe handling and storage of gas cylinders.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and implementation of accidental release prevention programs and facility safety programs: These programs have been developed in accordance with state and federal regulations.  They are reviewed annually to ensure they are properly implemented and records are maintained to support implementation.\n\n\n\nComprehensive training that includes classroom and on-the-job training:  Training has been established for new and existing employees such that safety in operations is maintained.\n\n\n\nA systematic preventive maintenance program: All relevant equipment is on a schedule for inspection. Inspections are documented and certain equipment are tested for proper operation on a regular schedule. \n\n\n\nA thorough accident reporting and investigation program: The accident/incident reporting and investigation procedure requires the reporting and investigation not only of incidents resulting in injuries, but also incidents that had the potential to result in an injury to an employee or a significant impact on the company's business.\n\n\n\nRestricted access: The facility has perimeter electronic gates that are always closed to restrict access into the facility. The facility is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Cameras in the storage areas record all activities.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be fr"

In addition, there have been no releases of regulated substances that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity for each of the chemicals.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAll regulated processes have been identified, located, and mapped. A cylinder storage procedure maintains consistent locations for each material.  Any changes in chemical storage locations are documented annually with the County of Alameda Department of Environmental Health in the facility's Hazardous Materials Business Plan.\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas maintains an onsite Emergency Response Team (ERT).  ERT members must go through refresher training every year. At least four responders are always available at all times. Appropriate personal protective equipment is maintained at the site for response actions. \n\n\n\nEvacuation procedures have been developed and all personnel are trained in the procedures. The Emergency Response Contact List is maintained and all personnel are trained on the portions relevant to their job.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas has made enhancements to improve safety at the facility.  For example, the facility has discontinued the use of the boron trichloride and chlorine purification processes, which were previously regulated under CalARP. The systems involved the processing of toxic and corrosive gases.  The chemicals have been removed from the systems, and the equipment has been shut down and properly isolated.  With the sy"

These audits have resulted in recommendations to improve safety at the facility, and the facility has proceeded with addressing and implementing these recommendations.  The facility utilizes a tracking system to ensure the recommendations are addressed in a timely manner.  Below is a sample of action items identified from previous audits that have been completed to improve safety at the facility:\n\n\n\n1) Develop a method to ensure that the annual SOP review is documented using the SOP Review Certification Form.  Consider incorporating the form into Master Control.\n\nActions Taken: Matheson has begun utilizing a tracking system (Intelex) to ensure the annual SOP reviews are tracked/performed and documented.  Intelex sends a notification email to the Site Manager when the annual review is due.  The SOP review form has been incorporated into the corporate document control system (Master Control).  \n\n\n\n2) Ensure refresher training on all work instructions occurs to satisfy the three year refresher requirement.  Also ensure documentation of training includes the means used to verify that training was understood by the employee.\n\nActions Taken: Employees receive training on the work instructions annually through Master Control.  Employees log in to Master Control, read through the work instructions, and take a test to ensure they understood the contents of the work instructions.  Training documentation, including the results of the test, is maintained on Master Control.\n\n\n\n3) Update the Mechanical Integrity program to include the maintenance performed on the containment vessels.\n\nActions"
