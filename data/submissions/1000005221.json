Specifically, the personnel of the Muncie Wastewater Treatment Plant are committed to operating and maintaining the process covered in this Risk Management Plan in a way that will prevent the release of hazardous substances used in the process.   This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities performed at this facility.  These include:\n\nX A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\nX A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\nX An overview of our accidental release prevention program\nX A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nX An overview of our emergency response program\nX The data elements from the facility's specific Risk Management Program\n\n1.2 COVERED PROCESS AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Muncie Sanitary District owns and operates a 24 million gallon per day wastewater treatment plant for domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater. The Muncie Wastewater Treatment Plant is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  From late Spring to early Fall the plant is required by Indiana law to operate an additional process to our routine wastewater treatment operation.  This process presently consists of an operation in which metered amounts of chlorine is added to the wastewater to disinfect it.  When the wastewater has been treated, prior to its discharge, metered amounts of sulfur dioxide are added to remove any residual chlorine.  Both the chlorine and the sulfur dioxide used in this process are EPA regulated toxic substances.  They have been identified as having the potential to cause off site consequences in the event of a substantial acciden"

Both of these materials are shipped to the plant in one ton cylinders.  These cylinders are large enough to limited the number of tank changes required, yet small enough that the total potential release from one cylinder is limited.  Through the Winter months when this system is not in operation, neither of these materials are kept at the facility.  Maintenance of the system is also performed at that time. \n\n1.3 OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires a worst-case scenario and several alternative release scenarios for the regulated materials at our facility be modeled to better understand the potential impact certain releases may have.  The following are brief summaries of the worst case scenario and several alternate scenarios  that have been modeled.  The benefit of these scenarios is that they help Muncie Sanitary District personnel realize the importance of maintaining a safe operation.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Chlorine vessel rupture\n\nThe objective of the worst case scenario is to establish the  potential of a major release of material at a given facility.  The worst case scenario does not take into account the practicality of \"how\" the major release would occur.  It is designed to take into account only what might occur given the materials and storage vessels located at a given facility.  \n\nThe scenario used at the Muncie Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTTP) demonstrates a total release from a ruptured 1 ton chlorine cylinder that is typically used at the facility. Tables used took into account that the facility is located within an urban topography, meaning one that is broken up by buildings and other structures.  The table used for this calculation is the EPA Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) model for wastewater treatment plants.  Using the EPA tables the toxic endpoint for the modeled release"

As explained earlier, the worst case scenario demonstrates only the potential of a release and does not indicate what is likely to occur at any given time. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Releases\n\nAlternate release scenarios, unlike the worst case scenario, are designed to follow potential releases that would be more likely to occur given normal facility operations.  Below are several examples investigated for both liquid and gas releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nPotential liquid releases of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide may be possible if a cylinder were punctured.  Although the cylinder is designed to withstand the impact from a fall, for the purposes of this model we have assumed that a puncture can occur.  For both of the scenarios listed, a puncture, with the equivalent area of a one inch hole, is used to demonstrate the potential distance to a toxic endpoint.  The liquid from either chlorine or sulfur dioxide would flash into vapor as a result of the puncture.  Using EPA tables a chlorine cylinder puncture (liquid release) might have a potential for a toxic endpoint 0.7 miles from the release.  Using the same tables a sulfur dioxide cylinder puncture (liquid release) might have a toxic endpoint 0.6 miles from the release. The area of this potential release includes residences, major businesses, and recreational areas. \n\nPotential vapor releases of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide may be possible if a failure occurred in pressure piping.  For both of these scenarios EPA tables were used to determine the effects of a vapor release that could occur from the tank connections. As a leak from a pipe connection is variable depending on the specific problem and therefore not easily defined, an equivalent area of a 1/16 up to a 1/2 inch hole is used to demonstrate the potential distance to a toxic endpoint"

This step prevents damaged cylinders from being stored at the facility.\n\nCylinders are changed only during the day shift when daylight conditions can assist in better inspection and more personnel are at the facility to summon emergency services. \n\nThe individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.   Muncie Sanitary District employees are committed to these elements for accident prevention.\n\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents having off-site consequences during the past five years.\n\nIf such an incident were ever to occur, we will conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events to prevent their reoccurrence.\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has a site emergency plan designed to provide information to site personnel regarding specific actions to take during an emergency.  Plant personnel are not equipped to respond directly to a hazardous materials release, however, the are aware of the proper methods to summon emergency responders who can perform specialized tasks.  As a precaution, emergency kits for cylinders are maintained on site for use by outside response teams.  \n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChanges to the process to improve safety are always under consideration.  Preliminary investigations are under way to determine if other methods may be used in the regulated process to reduce or eliminate the specific hazards posed by chlorine and sulfur dioxide."
