According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the end point is 4.4 miles. There are about 100 people in this area, prevailing winds should move the gas out of town.\n\nThe general accidental releases prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident pervention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
