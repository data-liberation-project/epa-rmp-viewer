If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify the ward county fire department, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled;\nThis facility is a Anhydrous Ammonia storage plant witch holds about 26000 gals. It is used to fill nurse tanks, so farmers can transport the Anhydrous Ammonia to there fields wher it is used as fertitizer.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario;\nThe worst-case scenario would be if the storage tank failed, this would result in 127200 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia to be released in to the air. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the end point is 4.4 miles. There are about 100 people in this area, prevailing winds should move the gas out of town.\n\nThe general accidental releases prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident pervention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The Anhydrous Ammonia plant is designed, installed and maintaind in accordance with all state laws.\n\nFive-year accident history;\nWe have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\nThe emergency response program;\nIn the event of an emergency involving our Anhydrous Ammonia plant, it is our policy to notify the ward county fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department. We have sent maps to the fire department, and the local emergency managers.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. NONE."
