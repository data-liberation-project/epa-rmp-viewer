ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail - Yuma conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\n\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\n\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail - Yuma uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in Appendix 8.1 show the facility location map and site plan.\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail - Yuma handles anhydrous ammonia, CAS 7664-41-7, which is listed federally as a regulated substance in quantities greater than the threshold quantities (TQs). The federal TQ for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lb. of ammonia in any single refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in product storage cooling, product precooling (vacuum cooling), water chilling, ice generation and product freezing operations. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the largest single system"

These processes are the Main System and one (1) full-car (24-Pallet) Vacuum Cooling System (R-18 refrigeration trailer, T-90 vacuum tube & VP-90 vacuum pump). The Main System is the only system with an ammonia quantity above the federal threshold quantity. The standalone full-car vacuum cooling system has less than the federal threshold quantity of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe largest system is the Main System that serves the cold storage warehouses, falling film water chillers, IQF freezers, full-car and half-car vacuum cooling systems, and ice maker. Main System is composed of fixed and portable equipment. Fixed equipment includes screw compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators & pressure coolers, falling film water chillers, IQF freezers, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable equipment includes full-car and half-car vacuum cooling systems (vacuum cooling tubes, surge drums, and vacuum pumps), and ice maker. Main System is operated seasonally from November to April. At the end of the season, vacuum cooling systems and the ice maker are removed from the site. The ammonia charge of the Main System is approximately 52,600 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe facility is owned and operated by the Taylor Farms Retail - Yuma. Growers Express leases the part of the facility, which include the processing rooms. Taylor Farms Retail - Yuma conducts the precooling (vacuum cooling), ice making and the shipping operations. Four (4) half-car vacuum cooling systems and the ice maker that are connected to the main system is owned by the facility. Two full-car vacuum cooling systems, one connected to the main system and one standalone, are leased from the Western Precooling Systems (WPS).\n\n\n\nEach vacuum cooling system that is connected to the main system is composed of a vacuum tube (12-pallet or 24-pallet), surge drum (one or t"

Standalone vacuum cooling system is composed of a full-car (24-pallet) vacuum cooling tube, one high-side refrigeration trailer (evaporative condenser, screw compressor, and high-pressure receiver), and one low-side refrigeration trailer (low-pressure receiver and pumper drums, and vacuum pump). The ammonia charge of the standalone vacuum cooling system is approximately 5,300 lbs. Standalone vacuum cooling system will be pumped down to onsite nurse tanks at the end of the season. All of the vacuum cooling systems and the ice maker are removed from the facility at the end of each season.\n\nThe total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is approximately 57,900 lbs. Public receptors are located within the worst-case accidental release toxic endpoint area.\n\nThe compressors have safety cutouts that will shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and the compressor are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. All low side vessels that are connected directly to the suction of compressor is installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressor upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming.\n\n\n\nUpdated refrigeration drawings are located in Appendix 8.1-Refrigeration System Drawings. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix 12.1, describe equipment details.\n\n\n\nThe main refrigeration system at this facility is a combination of single-stage and two-stage vapor compression cycle and the standalone vacuum cooling system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle.

The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, priority level and implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\n\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.

Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail - Yuma maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Chapter 16 - Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators are trained for safe operation of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are relief valves protecting pressure vessels and compressors which relieve to diffusion tank.\n\n\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms Retail - Yuma personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.
