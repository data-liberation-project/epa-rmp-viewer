Facility Information------\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 42291 Farm Supplies Wholesalers, whereas we are engaged in providing agricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facilities used for this product will be included in this report.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct applications for farm fields during the early spring and late fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with little, if any product transfer taking place. The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is 251,430 Ibs. The maximum on site vessel size is 18,000 gallons, storing 79,000 Ibs. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 Ibs. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times day or night during use, and through out the off season when not in use.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario------\nThe worst-case scenario would be release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank, release as a gas"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .94 miles.\nAlternate Release Scenario------\nA 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenartio followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quatity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 miles.(the most likely incident would be a release from a break in a 1-inch hose scenario followed by a releasee for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity release with this scenario would be 2,901pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)is .22 miles).\nAccidental Release Program-------\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CPR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Additionally, we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia And have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, break-away couplers at risers, emergency shut-off valves, barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and lock-outs to prevent tampering when site is unattended. Finally, we maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety\n  training exercises on Anhydrous Ammon"

We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38. We have provided State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they conform to the community plan(s). We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training program by the local fire department, local emergency response team, community planners, etc., that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time."
