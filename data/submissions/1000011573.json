Huestess Waste Water Treatment Plant is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures through various training, safety, emergency and accidental release prevention programs, and overall process safety management.  The City is responsible for the training of all employees at the waste water treatment plant.  All new employees are provided training in the following topics, at a minimum:  the requirements of Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, chemicals used in the plant, how to read and get information from MSDS's, process hazards, use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedures, understanding process safety management, and the location of MSDS's, PSMP, and other safety information.  In addition to initial training, employees are trained on various topics related to the facility and its processes once every two weeks.\n     The E.H. Huestess Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located in southeast Cayce, adjacent to the Congaree River.  The plant currently has a daily process capacity of 9.5 million gallons per day.  The following processes provide both primary and secondary treatment and disinfection:  bar screens and grit removal system, activated sludge, disinfection using chlorine, dechlorination using sulfur dioxide, pH adjustment using sodium hydroxide if needed at the headworks, and at Pump Station #1 about 3/4's of a mile upstream of the wastewater treatment plant also located adjacent to the Congaree river, the use of Magnesium Hydroxide. Aerobic sludge digestion, and sludge thickening using belt press and drying beds.  The following substances are used in the treatment processes: chlorine,sulfur dioxide,sodium hydroxide,Magnesium Hydroxide,Clarifloc SE506 Polymer,Hydrated Lime.    \n        \n     The WWTP currently holds a complete Process Safety Management Plan as required by 29 CFR 1910.119,  a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan as required under NPDES Permit No. SC0024147, and an Operations and Maint"
