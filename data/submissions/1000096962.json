FutureFuel is a manufacturer of specialty organic chemical intermediates.  Some of the chemicals manufactured at FutureFuel include: paint and coating additives, intermediates used in plastics, agricultural products, and bio-based products.  FutureFuel has RMP regulated flammables consisting of ethyl mercaptan, acetaldehyde, a CBI flammable substance , trimethylamine and propylene.  In addition, the facility uses chlorine, oleum (30%), anhydrous hydrogen chloride, formaldehyde, phosphorus oxychloride, vinyl acetate and bromine which are RMP regulated toxic substances. \n\n\n\nThe FutureFuel plant site has a long-standing history of protecting the health and safety of employees, the community, and the environment.  This is evidenced through over 20 years of safe operations and excellent environmental stewardship, through our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care & reg;. To protect people, property, and the environment, we use multiple systems-or layers of protection-where one system is designed to backup another system.  The first layer involves accident prevention by identifying and reducing risks during the design and before startup of new manufacturing processes.  The second layer involves operating and maintaining equipment and processes in a manner that reduces risks and minimizes incidents.  The third layer involves maintaining the capability to respond to and control incidents in a timely manner.\n\n \n\nAll RMP covered processes at FutureFuel are regulated as Program 3.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nFutureFuel is committed to a goal of providing a workplace that is free of accidents.

Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in employee participation plans that address each accident prevention program element.  In addition, FutureFuel has a number of initiatives underway that address process and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include FutureFuel's Leading Indicators Process which is a process for reporting safety concerns and ensuring that such concerns are addressed promptly.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFutureFuel keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information.  This information is normally compiled in a Process Safety Information (PSI) binder or filed electronically. The PSI and referenced documents are readily available to employees as part of the employee participation plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nFutureFuel has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards before the manufacturing process begins.\n\n\n\nFutureFuel uses a PHA technique that is appropriate to the complexity of the process being studied.  There are four techniques in use at FutureFuel.  These are Check List, What If, What If-Check List, and Hazard and Operability Analysis.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, chemical, and engineering expertise and experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident "

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nAll processes undergo a revalidation PHA at least every five years as long as the process is active.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFutureFuel maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change Process.  The Production Manager certify these procedures annually as accurate.  The Process Safety Review Committee reviews them at least every five years.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo compliment written procedures for process operations, FutureFuel has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Each new employee receives basic training in department operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is provided training on process-specific duties and tasks.  This is done through an operator training program or by pairing the new operator with an experienced operator for an appropriate period of time.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, FutureFuel has procedures in place to provide contractors information on the hazards in their work area.  In addition, FutureFuel has a process for the selection of contractors and evaluation of their safety performance.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFutureFuel conducts a PSSR for any new process, new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of a PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and supporting systems are operationally ready. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFutureFuel has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFutureFuel has long-standing, documented safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
