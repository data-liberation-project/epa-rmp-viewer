The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Texas City Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits \r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Texas City Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the auditing process, including interviews and data collection.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Texas City Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \r\nThe processes at the Texas City Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

For example, as a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Texas City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Texas City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant is committed to the safety of Texas City Plant workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Texas City Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Texas City Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the Texas City fire department to alert the local industrial mutual aid society (IMAS)  to assist in controlling and containing"

Texas City Plant, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\r\nThe Texas City Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at company facilities. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Site General Manager's staff. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Process Safety and Project Engineering Manager.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has also been delegated to the Process Safety and Project Engineering Manager.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the plant Environmental, Health, and Safety Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nThe ISP Texas City Plant Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in Texas City, Texas. Chemicals manufacturing commenced on this 330-acre site in 1967. ISP Texas City employs approximately 150 hourly and salaried personnel.

In addition, the Texas City Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Texas City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Texas City Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Texas City Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Process Operating Manuals.  The Texas City Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe Texas City Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\nThe Texas City Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique in conjunction with the Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Texas City Plant periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\nProcedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Texas City Plant operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that could result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texas City Plant has implemented a plant training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New or transferred employees receive basic training in Texas City Plant operations. The new or transferred employee is then given classroom training on the unit(s) to which they will be assigned. After successfully completing this training, a new operator begins the next phase of training, on-the-job training (OJT). This training consists of hands on training coupled with evaluations of both actual in the field evaluation of knowledge and skills and written evaluations of knowledge and skills.
