Hempy\n\n\n\nFacility Telephone: (740)465-3251\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management, and employees of the Morral facility are committed to providing a safe workplace, free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and to minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling, and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is also available for sale to farmers for direct field application.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 280,000 pounds stored in two separate 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by transport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.  Each tank is fitted with emergency shut-off valves that can be activated from several locations, both at the tanks or outside the fenced area.\n\n\n\n10-34-0 Liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super ph"

The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and is stored in a pressurized above ground storage tank.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank, through a meter and a heat exchanger where the liquid anhydrous ammonia is vaporized.  After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium polyphosphates and heat.  The ammonium polyphosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium polyphosphate solution (10-34-0).\n\n\n\nThe ammonium polyphosphate solution is pumped to a heat exchanger that is cooled with a cooling tower.  The cooled solution then returns to the holding pool.\n\n\n\nSome of the ammonium polyphosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium polyphosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium polyphosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization flows to a storage tank.\n\n\n\nNPK (nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium)-grade fertilizers are manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, water, and other raw materials to achieve the proper ratios.  During this process the ammonia is added to the water to create an aqueous ammonia solution.  This is the source of nitrogen for the fertilizer.  The other sources of phosphorus and potassium are added to this solution in the amounts desired to achieve the proper NPK ratio, such as 5-10-10, 16-4-4, and 7-22-5.\n\n\n\nSlow release fertilizers are manufactured by combining water, anhydrous ammonia, and"

The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Sections 8 through 19 briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n1) Safety information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Safety Data Sheets (SDS), equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.
