      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Wenatchee Regional Water Supply System facility?s (herein after referred to as Regional Water) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of the City of Wenatchee to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nAt the Regional Water facility chlorine is used on-site to treat drinking water.  Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  The chemical properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure and reduce the risk to personnel and the community.\n\nRegional Water?s emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees.  Regional Water has trained its personnel in the safe handling of chlorine including training in the use of personal protective equipment and chlorine ?patch? kits.\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Regional Water Facility is a water pumping plant located north of the City of East Wenatchee, Douglas County, Washington.  The facility is located next to the Columbia River.  The surrounding area is open with a state park to the north.\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Regional Water facility is chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5).   The chlorine is used to treat drinking water for the Regional Water System which includes the City of Wenatchee, the Chelan County PUD and the City of East Wenatchee.  Four thousand pounds (two 1-ton cylinders) is the maximum amount of chlorine stored on-site.  \n\nRegional Water uses other hazardous substances on-site, but they are not listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, the City of Wenatchee believes in the concept set forth in the ?General Duty Clause? of the Clean Air Act.  To this e"

Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios\nThe off-site consequence analysis of the worst case and alternative scenarios were reviewed and no changes were made.\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Regional Water facility?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n-    Training of personnel\n-    Preventative maintenance program\n-    Use of safety equipment\n-    Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nRegional Water complies with OSHA and Washington State process safety management, applicable state safety and environmental regulations, The Chlorine Institute Manual for safe handling of chlorine, and the Uniform Fire Code.    The chlorination system was installed to standards and local code at the time of installation.  Other safety systems utilized at the Regional Water facility include:\n-    Chlorine detection alarm that triggers an alarm and light indicator on the control panel in the control room.  After hours this alarm triggers an auto-dialer which contacts the operator on-call.\n-    Appropriate overhead crane for handling the 1-ton cylinders.\n-    Emergency exhaust fan and re-circulating fan.\n-    Proper fitting and closing doors.\n\nOperating procedures and checklists have been prepared by Regional Water to be used by employees performing operational duties.  Procedures are kept in the control room.  These procedures include:\n-    Start up procedures\n-    Routine operations\n-    Maintenance\n-    Response to major and minor releases\n-    Emergency action plan\n\nE. Five Year Accident History\nThe Regional Water facility has not had any accidents involving chlorine in the last five years.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Regional Water has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involvin"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe City of Wenatchee plans to replace current chlorination system (gas liquefied by pressure) with a hypochlorinator.  This upgrade to a safer chlorination system will be completed by 2006.  The City of Wenatchee will also continue to ensure ongoing training and review of safety policies and procedures."
