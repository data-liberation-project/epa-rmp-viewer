ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nIn this manufacturing facility we handle anhydrous ammonia which is considered extremely hazardous by the EPA.  The inherent properties of anhydrous ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in its handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our personnel's health, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and Commonwealth rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with both the safety devices of the pertinent process equipment and the operational and safety training of our personnel. \nOur emergency response program is based upon the Compressed Gas Association, Inc./The Fertilizer Institute's \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\" training programs developed by large ammonia manufacturers and good engineering practice.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and State and Local Emergency Planning Committees. \n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThis facility stores and handles the anhydrous ammonia for the production of an ammonium bisulfite solution.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in IMO-V gas containers hauled by truck and it is stored in four storage tanks under pressure.  It is transferred to the process via a 1=\" schedule 80 steel pipe.  This facility has equipment for the safe unloading of these containers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees and authorized management personnel.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this manufacturing facility is anhydrous ammonia.\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 372,000 pounds.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL"

      "SummaryText": "S AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 108,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 90% at 850F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 5.6 miles (9 km).\n\nAlternative Scenario - Failure of 20 foot length of 2 inch hose used to unload isotainers.  Excess flow and check valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are released (30 lbs.).\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is less than 1000 feet.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable Commonwealth codes and regulations.  All operations personnel have been trained in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", large ammonia manufacturer training programs and reference to both the North American Emergency Response Guidebook and EPA's Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities. \n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer facilities are inspected weekly and tested annually by certified examiner."
