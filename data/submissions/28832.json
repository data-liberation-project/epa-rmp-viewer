We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help insure the safety of our employees, the public and the environment.  We follow the DuPont Corporate philosophy that the \"goal is zero\".  This means that we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to support our goal of zero.  Our site safety, operating and emergency response procedures are available to all site employees through hard copies and/or electronic copies on computers placed throughout the plant.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe DuPont Fayetteville Works site consists of approximately 2200 acres located on the Bladen and Cumberland County line adjacent to N.C. Highway 87.  It is approximately 15 miles southeast of Fayetteville, North Carolina.  Approximately 400 acres are currently used for manufacturing, with the remainder set aside for future manufacturing needs.\nThe NAFION(TM) and APFO processes at the DuPont Fayetteville Works are Prevention Program 3 processes.  The NAFION(TM) process produces a membrane used in fuel cells and the Chloralkali industry.  In the production of that product, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials:\n   - Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous (received and TFE/HCL Distillate)\n   - Tetrafluoroethylene (received as TFE/HCL Distillate)\n   - Sulfur Trioxide\nAPFO is a material used in the TEFLON polymer manufacturing process.  To produce APFO, the following regulated substance is used as a raw material:\n   - Oleum\n\nWORST CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance involves the failure of the TFE/HCL Distillate Storage Tank in which the total contents of the tank is release"

The release of 24,000 pounds of Anhydrous HCl has an off-site impact of 9.3 miles from the release as determined by the EPA's RMP*COMP(TM) and affect 24,000 people as determined by Landview 5 using 2000 Census data.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario for Sulfur Trioxide is a rupture of the storage tank resulting in the total release of the tank contents (22,000 pounds) with passive mitigation of the contents being collected in an existing sump.  This would result in toxic endpoint effects 2.2 miles downstream from the release and affect approximately 500 people.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Oleum is a rupture of the storage tank or tanker while unloading resulting in the total release of the tank contents (50,000 pounds) with passive mitigation of the contents being collected an existing sump.  The toxic endpoint would extend 3.0 miles from the release and impact approximately 1500 people.\n\nThe types of releases described above are unlikely due to routine inspections of the storage tanks and associated equipment. The areas are routinely patrolled to inspect for leaks and signs of incorrect operating conditions. We also seldom maintain the maximum inventory listed in any of these tanks.  If a release were to occur, the amount of material released would likely be much less.  We have used the information from these scenarios to insure that our emergency response plans address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nWORST CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is the failure of the TFE/HCL Distillate Storage Tank in which the total contents of the tank was released with no mitigation assumed.  This release, if ignited, would have no off site impact as determined by the use of EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  It should be noted that we do not store pure TFE on the site.  TFE/HCl, a non-flammable azeoptrope, is scrubbed based on production demand to produce TFE.   A total rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease of the storage tank is unlikely due to routine inspections of the storage tank and associated equipment.  We control the on-site inventory in two existing tanks such that either tank is capable of containing the full volume of TFE/HCl Distillate on the site.  Since the worst case release scenario does not have off-site impact, we have used the same scenario as the alternative flammable release scenario.\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe most significant alternative toxic release scenario involves the rupture of a transfer hose while unloading the TFE/HCl Distillate tanker into the TFE/HCl Distillate Storage Tank.  A total loss of the tanker contents is assumed to take place over a 30-minute period with no mitigation assumed.  This release of Anhydrous HCl will have an off site effect of 3.8 miles from the release as determined using EPA's RMP*COMP and affect 2,600 people.  To prevent this type of release, we have remote emergency shutdown capabilities to shut valves and stop the flow.  The tanker also has an ?excess flow valve? that is designed to stop flow in the event of a hose failure.\n\nThe SO3 alternative release scenario involves a leaking pipe on the SO3 Storage Tank with a response time of 120 minutes to secure the leak.  No mitigation is assumed for this event which results in toxic effects 1.6 miles from the release which would impact 170 people.  \n\nThe Oleum alternative release scenario also involves the rupture of a transfer hose while unloading the Oleum tanker into the Oleum Storage Tank.  A total loss of the tanker contents is assumed over a 29-minute period with passive mitigation of the material being collected in a sump.  The off-site impact is 1.2 miles from the release and involves 10 people.  There is not off-site effect from this event with active mitigation when personnel monitoring the unloading operation apply foam to the spill.  RMP*COMP was used to determine the endpoint of this release scenario.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION "

Our safety programs include guidelines which include a documented process technology system covering the hazards of materials, equipment design basis and process design basis.  It includes the requirement to choose materials of construction to provide mechanical integrity and incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as alarms, interlocks, and gas detectors.  It also includes identifying all process safety critical equipment and performing routine inspections to insure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work performed.  Our maintenance and operations personnel are trained, qualified and experienced.  The guidelines also include the requirement for operators and mechanics to follow approved procedures.  Processes are continually monitored by computer control systems and operators.  These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no off site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage due to the accidental release of regulated substances from the DuPont Fayetteville Works in the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur program provides planning and training for effectively protection our employees, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  An emergency response plan is in place and updated regularly and all employees are trained for their role in the emergency response plan.  The plant conducts emergency drills, and critiques are held after drills and actual events.
