To minimize property damage.\n\nCivic Center Properties maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) regulations.\n\nCivic Center Properties has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Civic Center Properties to evacuate all employees (including employees of warehouse tenants) and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available 24 hours per day for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Civic Center Properties was completed in February 2001.

      "SummaryText": "ada bordering the Interstate 15 freeway, south of Craig Road.  The immediate area is primarily light commercial and industrial. The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 15,000 pounds of ammonia for warehouse cold storage and food processing.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TS-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-1).  TS-1 is a reservoir used mainly as a liquid ammonia supply for cooling compressor oil.  HPR-1 serves as the main storage vessel for the system with the ability to store the entire Phase I inventory of 15,000 pounds of ammonia.  It supplies liquid ammonia to the High Temperature Recirculator (LR-1) which pumps the cold liquid to the dock and cooler evaporators (13). The liquid ammonia expands as it enters the various evaporator coils, reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for cooler rooms, the loading dock, packing, and curing areas. As the air is chilled by the evaporators, the ammonia is partially vaporized and returned to LR-1, which maintains a liquid/vapor mixture of ammonia at 33 psig.\n\nLR-1 also routes ammonia liquid to the Low Temperature Recirculator (LR-2), which maintains a further reduced pressure (and hence temperature) of 3.6 psig.  LR-2 supplies cold pumped liquid ammonia to the Blast Freezers, the -10?F Freezer, and the Dual Temperature Room and collects the resulting two-phased ammonia (suction).  As liquid ammonia collects in LR-2, it is drained into a transfer drum (LTD-1) (which is pressurized"

The compressors discharge high pressure vapor (150-160 psig) to the condensers via a single stage discharge header.  The condensers (EC-1 and EC-2) convert compressor discharge (hot gas) into high pressure liquid using a combination of fans and a water spray, and recycle it to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  Hot gas is also used for defrosting the evaporators on a timed cycle.\n\nThe system is also equipped with a dilution tank (DT-1) and an Emergency Control Box.  All of the relief valves are set to vent at 250 psig and discharge into a common header that vents into the bottom of the dilution tank, which is kept full of water.  In addition, the pressure in the system can be reduced manually by the valving located inside the Emergency Control Box located outside the Engine Room door. This control box allows the Fire Department to transfer ammonia from one vessel to another or vent the ammonia into the water dilution tank.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 15,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  (The capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is approximately 30,000 pounds of ammonia, so the entire ammonia charge is released.) The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference tables in the EPA-approved Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.

Reference tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Civic Center Properties ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Civic Center Properties facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, and Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nThe Civic Center Properties facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of an ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addi"
