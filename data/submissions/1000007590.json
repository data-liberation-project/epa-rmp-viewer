We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  In 2008 we were registered to ISO 14001 to further demonstrate our commitment to environmental awareness and stewardship.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving toluene diisocyanate mixed isomers (TDI), our policy is not to respond with our personnel, but to contact outside agencies and request that they respond to the situation.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances: The facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, using a pre-polymer blend of toluene diisocyanate mixed isomers (TDI) as one of the raw materials. The TDI pre-polymer is received in tank trucks which pressure unloads the material into an unload tank.  The unload tank is filled only when empty, and a full tanker carries approximately 44,000 pounds of pre-polymer.  The pre-polymer is transferred to a storage tank on an as needed basis.  If a foam formulation calls for the addition of the pre-polymer, the line operator enters that information into the process controller.  The line operator must then enable an auto-fill feature of the run tank and an automatic valve on a recirculating loop will open so that the pre-polymer can fill the run tank.  From there, the pre-polymer is chilled and pumped to to the mixing head station on our foam line.  It reacts with other components and is deposited on a carrier as polyurethane foam.\n\nRelease scenarios: In accordance with RMP reporting requirement changes, our Worst Case and two Alternate scenarios are only contained "

      "SummaryText": "within Sections 2 & 3. \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific steps: We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\no Safety information\no Hazard review\no Operating procedures\no Training\no Maintenance\no Compliance audits\no Incident investigation\n \n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases of TDI that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our pre-polymer TDI, it is our policy to notify Guardian Environmental (alternate would be Elk Environmental) and request that they respond to the situation. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  The following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n 1. Annual reviews of our Emergency Response Plan.                                                                                     2. Incorporation of Maintenance procedures into Preventitive Maintenance software  program.                                                      \n 3. Active participation in our Near Miss Program.                                                                                 \n4. Improved automated controls."
