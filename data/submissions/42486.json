The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original construction and during system modifications.  Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the ap"

The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses, residential development, and small agricultural properties.  The site is bordered by F Street to the northwest, 5th Street to the northeast, industrial businesses and residential development to the southeast and southwest. FTP 1 is approximately one mile east of Highway 99 and one quarter mile west of Golden State Boulevard.\n\nThe facility was originally constructed in the late-1950s.  The refrigeration system was remodeled in the mid and late-1980s.  Foster Farms purchased the plant from Butterball Turkey Company in July 1999.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughtering, storage, processing, packaging, and distribution of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and is staffed by a refrigeration operator or mechanic 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The system provides cooling for production areas, product, and water chilling.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  The Foster Farms facility has reported two accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years:\n\nDecember 2004 and April 2003.  Foster Farms personnel mitigated both releases.  The local fire department and county hazmat team provided backup support during the incidents.  \n\nThe April 2003 release resulted from a failed compressor seal. Ammonia vapor was released through the failed seal.  No off-site impact occurred and no injuries were reported.  The facility has since implemented a program to verify c"

      "SummaryText": "ompressor seal installations.  \n\nThe December 2004 release resulted from a failed 3/4-inch nipple attached to a solenoid valve. Ammonia vapor and liquid was released through the broken nipple. No off-site impact occurred and no injuries were reported.  The facility has since replaced the defective nipple and inspected other similar nipples and found them to be safe.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The FTP 1 ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  \n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\u00b7emergency shutdown systems\n\u00b7component specific safety shutdowns\n\u00b7pressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\n\u00b7the installation of a PRV relief headers has been completed per previous PHA recommendation\n\u00b7preventive maintenance program has been reviewed to verify that all ammonia system components are included and maintenance frequencies are appropriate per previous PHA recommendation\n\u00b7ammonia detection system is connected to an automatic phone dialing system\n\u00b7activation of ammonia detection system closes liquid solenoid valves to production area ammonia equipment\n\u00b7engine rooms are equipped with ammonia detection systems\n\u00b7new engine room is equipped with emergency shut down switch\n\u00b7engine rooms are equipped with ventilation systems\n\u00b7ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\n\u00b7a fire sprinkler system is installed in the majority of"

      "SummaryText": "the plant including the engine rooms\n\u00b7operators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system.  Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  Others will be implemented during the next several months.  The status of significant mitigation measures is as follows:\n\u00b7management is evaluating the installation of an emergency shut down switch for the old Engine Room\n\u00b7management is evaluating the installation of an exit directly to the outside from the old Engin"

      "SummaryText": "e Room\n\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly and is scheduling completion of proposed actions.  Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility.  As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farms continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community.  Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations.  However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM and related attachments and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms\u00bf internal review practices, and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site.  Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM, related documents, and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
