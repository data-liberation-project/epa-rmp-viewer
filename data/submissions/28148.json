ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe management and staff of the Denver Distribution Center are committed to operating their facility with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Denver Distribution Center personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Denver Distribution Center personnel, and the environment, the plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Denver Distribution Center's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Denver Distribution Center operates several refrigerated warehouses and freezers.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the facility.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for dock operations, coolers and freezers.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Denver Distribution Center which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver to the 89 psig Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR-1).  In addition, liquid ammonia is routed to the compressors for thermosyphon oil cooling.  CPR-1 sends liquid a"

Existing Meat and Perishable Warehouse Evaporators \n? \nCPR-2 feeds liquid to evaporators in the -20?F Freezer (EVAP-2?EVAP-12).  At the Evaporators, the liquid ammonia is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resultant vapor/liquid mix is drawn back to the respective suction accumulator as follows: the +30?F Suction Accumulator (ACC-3) draws suction from EVAP-35?EVAP-40; the +18?F Suction Accumulator (ACC-2) draws suction from EVAP-1, EVAP-13?EVAP-34, & EVAP-41?EVAP-45 and also receives defrost return from EVAP-2?EVAP-12; the -30?F Suction Accumulator (ACC-3) draws suction from EVAP-2?EVAP-12.\n\nAt the suction accumulators, the wet suction from the evaporators is separated.  The liquid falls to the bottom and the vapor is drawn from the top by the compressors. Booster Compressors (COMP-1 & COMP-2) draw low stage suction from ACC-1, High Stage Compressors (COMP-3 & COMP-4) draw medium stage suction from ACC-2, and High Stage Compressors (COMP-5 & COMP-6) draw high stage suction from ACC-3.   Each suction accumulator is equipped with two dump traps to return excess liquid to the respective controlled pressure receiver.  ACC-1 returns excess liquid to CPR-2, while ACC-2 and ACC-3 return excess liquid to CPR-1.\n\nThe Swing Compressor may operate in any of the above"

The Booster Compressors discharge vapor to the +30?F Suction Accumulator, while the High Stage and Swing Compressors discharge vapor to the Condensers.  High stage discharge from the compressors is also used in i) the hot gas defrost cycle of the evaporators, ii) pressurizing the Transfer Traps during the liquid transfer process, and iii) maintaining pressure in the Controlled Pressure Receivers.\n\nThe high stage discharge from the compressors is condensed back into high pressure liquid at the Condensers.  Latent heat is rejected by spraying water and blowing air over coils filled with ammonia.  The resultant high pressure ammonia liquid is returned to the Thermosyphon Receiver to begin the cycle again.\n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger.  The Auto Purger removes non-condensables (i.e., air and water) from the system.  There are four purge points located at the Condenser, and one at the Thermosyphon Receiver.\n \nThe relief valves are set at 250 psig on all vessels, the compressors, the purger, and the condensers.  The relief valves vent to an Ammonia Dump Tank located outside the equipment room.\n\nC.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel.  If a vessel is located inside a building, the EPA allows a passive mitigation factor of 55% to be used in calculating the release rate to the outside atmosphere when the release is enclosed by a building.\n\nThe High Pressure Receiver, located inside the engine room, can hold the entire ammonia charge.  Therefore the entire charge of ammonia (25,700 lbs) is assumed to be released inside an enclosure.  This results in a release rate of 1,414 lbs"

Low wind speeds (1.5 m/s) and stable atmospheric conditions (F stability) will allow the gas cloud to travel as far as possible by limiting cloud dispersion.  The results are conservative.\n\nEPA's 'Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration,' May 2000, Exhibit 4-4 was used to find the downwind distance for the worst case release to 200 ppm in an urban setting.  The RMP*CompTM Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and EPA was used to prepare the data in this guidance document.  This guidance document provides data for ammonia refrigeration systems and will ensure consistency throughout the industry.\n\nThis release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.  \n\nNote: Item 2-6 is required to be reported to 1 significant-figure and is the mitigated release rate, where as item 2-5 is the total quantity and is reported to 2 significant figures.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nA release of ammonia resulting from a 0.25 inch diameter hole in a pipe for one hour.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 129 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed and D stability.  Reference tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Denver Distribution Center was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors throughout the plant, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition changes that occur within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, 'Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.'\n\nE.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the past five years, the Denver Distribution Center has not had any ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or offsite evacuations.\n\nF.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n The initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), which was completed on April 17th and 18th, 2003,  included a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study as well as a Facility \"What If\" Walkthrough.  The PHA provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Denver Distribution Center located at 4600 Stapleton Drive South in Denver, Colorado. \n\nThe following recommendations from the PHA are scheduled to be completed by May 2004:\n\nR01:Replace, or recertify, relief valves that discharge in service, or every five years, per the industry standard.  Include in Mechanical Integrity.\n\nR02:Include an annual visual inspection of the integrity of the  Thermosyphon Receiver in Mechanical Integrity.\n\nR03:Train operators that in the event of a potentially hazardous leak, whether it be in the Engine Room or in the Warehouse, they should shutdown the system, via the E-Stop buttons, if necessary.  Document the training.\n\nR04:Update the current 8?x11\" drawings to reflect any changes or edits resulting from the HazOp.\n\nR05:Prepare a Standard Operating Procedure for transferring liquid from the +18?F Suction Accumulator to the 75 psig Controlled Pressure Receiver.\n\nR06:Incorporate any recommendations deemed to be applicable from the 2002 PHA.\n\nR07:Consider establishing a log of the counters associated with the dump traps for the initial startup period of the system, at least.  If the log is established, include in Mechanical Integrity.\n\n"
