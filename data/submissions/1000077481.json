It is Western Power and Steam II LLC's policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations. Further, it is Western Power and Steam II LLC's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\n\n\nWestern Power and Steam II LLC emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs. In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, hazardous materials handling, safe work methods, and safe use of equipment. Additionally, emergency response procedures have been established by Western Power and Steam II LLC.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Western Power and Steam II LLC cogeneration facility is owned and operated by Western Power and Steam II LLC. The plant, which is located in the Kern River Oil Field, northeast of Bakersfield, California, began commercial operation in the spring of 1990.\n\n\n\nCogeneration, in the case of the Western Power and Steam II LLC facility, is the simultaneous \n\nproduction of thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel source. \n\nCombustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically coupled to an electric \n\ngenerator. Waste heat from the gas turbine's exhaust flows into a heat recovery steam generator \n\n(HRSG). The HRSG extracts the heat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil recovery. Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator coupled to the combustion turbine.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Western Power and Steam II LLC facility to create a reducing \n\natmosphere in the SCR pr"

The operation of the SCR \n\nsystem substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the gas turbine.\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 12,417-gallon (water capacity) storage tank. The maximum intended inventory of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is based on the American National Standard Institute's K61.1 safety requirement and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in Section 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR). These standards and regulations limit the maximum ammonia storage capacity of the tank to approximately 54,355 pounds.\n\n                                                           \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/I (200 ppm).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Elements\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Western Power and Steam II LLC to address the anhydrous ammonia system. The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention elements:\n\n\n\nELEMENT 1: Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\n\nELEMENT 2: An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and has been updated and revalidated.\n\n\n\nELEMENT 3: Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented and are reviewed by the Operations and Maintenance Supervisor and Control Room Operators at least annually and certified by the Plant Manager. \n\n\n\nELEMENT 4: Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility h"

The Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWestern Power and Steam II LLC has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based SCR system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWestern Power and Steam II LLC has established emergency procedures and mechanisms to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. Emergency Procedures for ammonia detection, assessment, release reporting, and specific actions for leak response and process repair attempts are contained in the WPS Safety Instructions Manual.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Western Power and Steam II LLC regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, Western Power and Steam II LLC has installed additional equipment to improve safety. Fixed ammonia detectors were installed in April 2019.\n\n"
