There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year period or in the history of the plant.  The Commission submitted a Risk Management Program as required by law on June 20, 1999. \n\nOn October 1, 2000, U.S. Water, L.L.C. assumed operations of the SRWTF.  To comply with the OSHA, the initial step was to develop a prevention program as required by the RMP and by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This prevention program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. An RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. \n\nKey items included in the manual are:\n\n-  Written site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident    Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self-Audits;\n- Chlorine safety information as required by the egulations;                                                                              \n- Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management; and\n- Chlorine system maintenance procedures.\n\nThe following additional steps were implemented to complete the prevention program:\n\n- Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n- Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process;\n\n- Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n- Training in support of the certification of operators.\n        \nThe U.S. Water L.L.C. Operations Manager and Corporate Health & Safety  Manager are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations.  The site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded. I"

      "SummaryText": "n 2001, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a Regional Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response have been obtained.  Where necessary, communication plans will be developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are being routinely conducted.\n\nTo further understand chlorine risks, a consulting firm was contracted to conduct an updated \"Offsite Consequence\" Modeling Analysis, as required by EPA's Risk Management Program. Both a \"Worst Case\" and an \"Alternative Case\" chlorine release scenarios were studied for the site.\n\nThe \"Worst Case\" modeling showed the potential impact of a full, 2000 pound cylinder of chlorine released in 10 minutes. This resulting chlorine plume extended 0.9 miles. For the \"Alternative Case\" a more typical release from a piping failure was modeled.  The modeling indicated that a plume extending 0.2 miles would result.\n\nThe modeling showed that the risk of chlorine exposure is low due to the favorable location of the plant. The Wastewater Treatment Plant is surrounded by floor control berms on 3 sides and State Highway 5 on the  fourth side.  Since chlorine is a heavier-than-air, reactive gas, these barriers would act to contain and dissipate any chlorine release. In addition, the Connecticut and Westfield Rivers are on three sides of the plant. Any chlorine that leaves the plant side will flow to these bodies of water which will significantly adsorb and disburse the chlorine.  A chlorine release should result in minimum to no public exposure.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The SRWTF has an active Employee Safety Committee that is a joint management-employee committee.  The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety comm"
