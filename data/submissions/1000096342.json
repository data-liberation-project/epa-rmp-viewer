This commitment is demonstrated not only through the daily actions of its management staff and employees, but also through the comprehensive accidental release prevention program Omaha Steaks has in place.  This program covers areas such as system design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and contractor and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration process at our facility.  Omaha Steaks makes every effort to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia, and as such, releases are not foreseeable, however, Omaha Steaks' Emergency Action Plans are fully coordinated with the emergency response personnel at the Omaha Fire department and their associated HAZMAT Team to control and mitigate the effects of any release.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOmaha Steaks F Street Plant is a meat processing facility located in Omaha, NE.
