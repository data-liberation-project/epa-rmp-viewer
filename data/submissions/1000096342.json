This commitment is demonstrated not only through the daily actions of its management staff and employees, but also through the comprehensive accidental release prevention program Omaha Steaks has in place.  This program covers areas such as system design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and contractor and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration process at our facility.  Omaha Steaks makes every effort to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia, and as such, releases are not foreseeable, however, Omaha Steaks' Emergency Action Plans are fully coordinated with the emergency response personnel at the Omaha Fire department and their associated HAZMAT Team to control and mitigate the effects of any release.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOmaha Steaks F Street Plant is a meat processing facility located in Omaha, NE.  The stationary source at tis facility is a closed-loop, ammonia refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia.   All the anhydrous ammonia stored on-site is used in the closed loop, ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n\n\nOmaha Steaks has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of both 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, commonly referred to as RMP, and 29 CFR 1910.119 of OSHA, commonly known as PSM.  This compliance is achieved through a unified PSM/RMP program at Omaha Steaks.  The Omaha Steaks F Street Plant is also subject to the notification requirements found in EPCRA Section 302.
