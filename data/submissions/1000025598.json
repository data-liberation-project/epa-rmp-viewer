In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to reduce the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs are applied to activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels that are interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release are considered a single process.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs show a commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures to minimize accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nThis Facility is a frozen vegetable processing plant, which produces bulk frozen peas, green beans, cut corn, Butternut squash, rutabaga, and other vegetables. These vegetables are locally grown and transported to our facility for processing. The refrigeration process for freezing these vegetables involves the use of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration proce"

We have two independent systems, with the largest system containing 30,000 pounds. The other system contains 22,000 pounds.  The total ammonia inventory on site includes 52,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed as required and they comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68. The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\n\n\n\n1    Process Safety Information\n\n2    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n3    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n4    Training\n\n5    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n6    Management of Change\n\n7    Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8    Compliance Audits\n\n9    Incident Investigation\n\n10    Employee Participation\n\n11    Hot Work Permit\n\n12    Contractor Qualifications\n\n13    Comprehensive Yearly Maintenance Program\n\n14    Ammonia Detection System\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe last incident occurred on June 12, 2010. There were no offsite injuries and no effect on the environment caused by that incident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nOakfield's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. Our employees receive refresher training and physicals annually, paid for by the company. This plan is coordinated with the Genesee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Oakfield Fire Department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with participation of the LEPC and the Fire Department. These drills are evaluated and documented to meet the criteria of our Emergency Response Program."
