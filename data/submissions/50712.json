      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nMonticello Steam Electric Station, Mt. Pleasant, TX 75455\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nLuminant Power\u00bfs overall approach to accident prevention and risk management is as follows:\n\nLuminant Power (LP) is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental \n\nreleases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  LP has implemented safety, environmental protection, \n\nand risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at its facilities.  \n\nIf there is an accidental release, LP will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response \n\nto minimize the effect of the release.  LP will also immediately notify the public, through local emergency \n\nmanagement agencies, of any actions necessary to ensure public protection.\n\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\nMonticello Steam Electric Station (MOSES) is an electric generating plant using fossil fuel (coal) as an energy \n\nsource.  The coal is burned in large boilers to produce steam, which is used as the motive force for the LP \n\nturbine generators.  LP takes great care in reducing emissions from burning coal to the greatest extent \n\npossible by injecting an ammonia/air mixture into the pollution control devices (electrostatic precipitators and \n\nbaghouses).  The ammonia reacts with sulfur dioxide present in the emission (flue gas) stream and acts to \n\nagglomerate the ash creating a larger particle size and improving performance of the pollution control devices.  \n\n\nLP uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) at MOSES.  It is purchased as a compressed liquefied \n\ngas in bulk from commercial suppliers and fed to vaporizers where the liquid is converted to a gas and then \n\ninjected into the flue gas streams.  There are two separate ammonia systems at MOSES, each with an 18,000 \n\ngallon storage tank.  Inventory is controlled to a maximum"
