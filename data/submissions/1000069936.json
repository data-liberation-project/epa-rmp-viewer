      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nResinall QalicB (RQB\") is a resin hydrogenation facility located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. As a result of the manufacturing process, hydrogen is present at the facility at times following gas delivery, in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions regulations. The facility has one covered process that requires the facility to meet Program 3 requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions regulations. Hydrogen is delivered to the facility in trucks and off-loaded into a storage tank. In the process, hydrogen is used in the production of hydrogenated resins. \n\n\n\nB.     Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Resinall\n\n\n\nRQB is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\nC.    Release Scenario Discussion\n\n\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the release scenarios that are being submitted by RQB. RQB elected to use the EPA RMP*Comp program and the Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance document to calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the hydrogen endpoint. \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario for RQB was determined to be an instantaneous explosion of the hydrogen storage tank. A major release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely due to the advances that have taken place in storage tank design and off-loading procedures, as well as development of a rigorous maintenance and prevention programs present at the RQB facility. The EPA RMP*Comp program was used to estimate the distance to the 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n"

The EPA RMP*Comp program was used to estimate the distance to the flammable endpoint. \n\n\n\nD.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nUnder the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  In the past five years, RQB has not had any accidents that meet the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions regulations.\n\n\n\nE.    Prevention Program Elements\n\n\n\nManagement System - RQB has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program to a qualified individual or position of responsibility. It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.48, including the following:\n\n?    The  safety data sheet (SDS) for hydrogen that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data,   thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\n?    Block flow diagrams for the covered process.\n\n?    Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n\n?    Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations from these limits for the covered process.\n\n?    Covered process equipment information consisting of materials of construction; piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs); electrical classification; relief system design and design basis; ventilation system design; design code"

The PHA revalidation for the remaining part of the covered process was completed by conducted a fresh PHA in April 2018.  The PHA leader defined the process sections to be assessed and posed relevant operational deviations for the participant to discuss, define concerns, and suggest corrective action items. Each identified action item was assigned to one of the participants to address. This PHA satisfies both of the hazard review requirements for the RMProgram (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 68) and Occupation Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for each covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52. Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process. Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\n\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including:\n\n?    Initial system startup; \n\n?    Normal operation; \n\n?    Temporary operations; \n\n?    Emergency shutdown and operations; \n\n?    Normal shutdown;\n\n?

The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown. Refresher training is provided at a minimum of every three years to all employees involved in working with the covered process. Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he or she received and understood the required training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - A maintenance program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.56 for covered process equipment. Employees involved in the maintenance of the covered processes receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions, and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks.

OSHA defines \"emergency response\" as \"a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders...to an occurrence which results in or is likely to result in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\" The key factor is that responders are designated for such tasks by their employer. The definition excludes \"responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\" as well as \"responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is not potential safety hazard (i.e., fire, explosion or chemical exposure).\"\n\nRQB does not respond to any release of hydrogen.
