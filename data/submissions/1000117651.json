(TSMC), is an advanced semiconductor facility on an approximate 1,100 acre parcel near the City of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona. The initial phase of the manufacturing facility (Phase 1) will utilize TSMC\u0092s 4 and 5 nanometer process technologies for semiconductor wafer fabrication.\n\nPhase 1 includes one fab building where semiconductor chips will be manufactured and appurtenant buildings containing support equipment, including natural gas fired boilers, diesel fired emergency generators, fire pump engines, and cooling towers. Appurtenant buildings include the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Bulk Chemical Storage (Lorry Building), Bulk Specialty Gas System (BSGS), Electrical Building (ELE), and Central Utility Plant (CUP) buildings.\n\nTSMC AZ uses 29% ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) as part of its wafer manufacturing process.  The chemistry is delivered by truck and stored in onsite bulk liquid tanks or stored and utilized directly from transportation cylinders.  The chemistry is then transferred by pipeline to the manufacturing process tools.  Waste from the process is managed according to hazard and regulatory requirements and sent offsite.\n\nJensen Hughes Engineering Consultants conducted Hazard and Operability Studies (HazOp) for each covered system between Sept. and Dec. 2022. Jensen Hughes also provided the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) for each covered system. As part of our ongoing process improvement plan, TSMC AZ will continually look for opportunities to make our system as safe as practical by reviewing potential incidents and implementing best practices.\n\nEach covered system operates in an enclosed building.  Spill containment measures include secondary containments, dikes, and drainage systems to minimize community impacts.  Spill containments are equipped with leak detectors and gas monitoring sys"

ERT has also conducted emergency response training with the Local Emergency Response Commission (LERC), local responders (fire and police departments), and the nearest hospital and integrated facility networks.  Additionally, all operators are required to wear PPE and have been HAZWOPER trained to respond to releases."
