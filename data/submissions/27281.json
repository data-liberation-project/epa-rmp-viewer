The primary activity at this plant is the processing and packaging of frozen food products. Ammonia is used throughout the plant for processing and storage. Approximately 40,000 lbs. Of ammonia is used in the system. Certified technicians who are licensed by the City of Erie operate the ammonia system. In addition all safety and monitoring systems are in place to notify management of anything out of the ordinary. As a result of having these technicians an systems in place, we have not had an ammonia related incident in the last five years.\n\nWe are in compliance with OSHA and county regulations. We are represented on the Local Emergency Planning Committee by Jeff Rothgeb the Safety and Environmental Coordinator. The city routinely conducts an annual fire inspection of the plant. Zurich Risk Management performs an annual inspection of the plant for our property insurers.\n\nWorst Case Ammonia Release Scenario:\n\nAn unmitigated release of  40,000 lbs. of  ammonia is possible due to a catastrophic event. The distance to the endpoint of the release is 1.7 miles. Local emergency responders guarantee a five minute response time. The residential population of this radius is approximately 21,366 people using the Landview program provided by the EPA for this purpose. Several scholls and other public receptors fall into this radius.\n\nPlant Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn March of 1997 an ammonia detection system was installed. This system has been replaced with newer technology in May of 2002.  In August of 2001 Jeff Rothgeb was hired as the plant Safety and Environmental Coordinator to ensure our facility meets safety and environmental regulations. Jeff works in conjunction with the refrigeration mechanics and maintenance managers to ensure practice meets procedure guidelines. This effectively creates a checks and bal"

In November of 2001 Jeff conducted Emergency Evacuation and PSM awareness training with the employees.  Our PHA was audited and approved recommendations made in March of 2002. We are currently reviewing  and scheduling their implementation. The SOP section of our PSM was updated in October 2002 and the PM program was revamped in December 2002. \n\nWe conduct annual training in accordance with regulations. In  June of 2000 24 hour hazwoper training was conducted  with our refrigeration mechanics. In  July and September of 2001 eight hour refresher course was completed. In May of 2002 we purchased the IIAR refrigeration training program which consists of 5 self paced modules that the mechanics work through completing competency testing by computer. The mechanics completed testing by 6/21/02."
