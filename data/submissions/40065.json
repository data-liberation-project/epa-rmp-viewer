Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Corsicana Technologies, Inc., Corsicana Plant, has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment.  This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important objectives.  Safety will take precedence over expediency or short cuts.  Corsicana intends to continue its complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management.  Corsicana believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCorsicana operates a specialty chemical plant, and manufactures fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal products are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.  The facility has seven regulated substances present at the site as raw materials for our processes, which include dimethylamine, acrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile], anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde (formalin), methyl chloride, and trimethylamine.\n\nAcrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile], anhydrous ammonia, formalin (i.e., 37% formaldehyde solution), and methyl chloride are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine are regulated as flammable chemicals.\n\nThe maximum inventory of the aforementioned regulated substances is 310,000 pounds of trimethylamine stored in an aboveground storage tank and railcar.  The remaining quantities of regulated substances are as follows:  57,000 pounds of dimethylamine; 68,000 pounds of acr"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  A number of processes at the facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCorsicana maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for OSHA's PSM regulation.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Corsicana primarily uses the checklist and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Corsicana maintains written operating procedures tha"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nCorsicana develops and implements safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lock-out and tag-out (LOTO); confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining\nCorsicana has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial training of operators is provided, and refresher training is provided as required.  Both initial and refresher training is documented and records of training are maintained onsite for at least 3 years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCorsicana has written procedures for maintaining on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures.  Corsicana carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and t"

The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Corsicana to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  These procedures will be updated as needed.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at Corsicana.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCorsicana conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

Section 7 of the RMP describes existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at Corsicana.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\nCorsicana has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, and the environment.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The emergency plan is maintained at the site for review by agencies such as the Navarro County the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nAt all times there must be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on-call (i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures.  This emergency coordinator will be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's emergency response plan, all operations "
