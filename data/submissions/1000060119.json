The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Libbey employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\n\n\nLibbey management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\n\nThe Libbey Glass Inc., Toledo, Ohio, facility combines raw materials to produce glassware. The raw materials used in the processes include various dry ingredients that are melted in a furnace and then pressed or blown into various shapes of ware. Support operations include a process fuel gas system (acetylene), propane tank fueling, limited quantities of acetylene, and administrative offices.\n\n\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP, and 29 CFR 1910.119, PSM: acetylene (primary) is used to lubricate molds in the Forming Department.  The gas is burned and the resulting residue (soot) is deposited on the mold and acts as a lubricant to keep the hot glass from adhering to the mold. The gas supplier (Praxair) performs all supply, transport and unloading operations. The acetylene system includes two trailers (11,056 pound maximum capacity.)  \n\n\n\nPropane gas is used to back up the natural gas fuel to the lehrs and to fill 40 pound portable tanks for propane fueled forklifts. Propane is not addressed in this RMP/PSM program, as it is exempted. Portable acetylene tanks us"
