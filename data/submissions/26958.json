BSE implements reasonable controls to prevent forseeable releases of hazardous substances.  BSE personnel are trained to respond defensively to releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Their response includes the prompt notification of emergency response personnel.  The facility has coordinated emergency response procedures with local fire departments and Green County Emergency Management.  In the event of a release which could result in an offsite impact, Green County Emergency Management will be contacted to alert the general public.\n\nBSE and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe BSE facility in Monroe, Wisconsin, produces fuel-grade ethanol from corn.  The BSE facility has a Program 3 covered process due to the onsite storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to control the pH of the slurry tank and to provide nutrients for the yeast that is used for fermentation of the grain.  An administrative inventory limit has been implemented to limit the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in this system to 74,880 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nOne worst-case release scenario was modeled for the anhydrous ammonia covered process using USEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis\", dated April 1999.  USEPA requires that the entire contents of the largest vessel be used for the worst-case release scenario.  This scenario is highly unlikely and has never occurred at the BSE facility.  An administrative inventory limit has been implemented to reduce the quantity released when modeling this scenario.  The worst-case release scenario for chlorine has "

Per USEPA guidance, the alternative release scenario is intended to be a more reasonable or likely event than the worst-case release scenario; however, it is still very conservative in nature.  The alternative release scenario was a complete line break with the release rate limited by the excess flow valve on the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The event modeled has never occurred at the BSE facility.  No passive or active mitigation systems were taken into consideration in the alternative release analysis.  The alternative analysis has the potential for offsite impacts.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is covered by both USEPA's Risk Management Program Rule, as well as, OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule for the anhydrous ammonia process.  This facility implements one combined Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  This program consists of a written management system.  The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This procedure enables the facilitiy to initiate and complete process changes associated with the anhydrous ammonia system while maintaining the Process Safety and Risk Management Program requirements at the facility.\n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled based on equipment failure; therefore, the mechanical integrity element of the program is key in preventing releases from the chlorine process.  This facility utilizes a computerized maintenance management system to implement the preventive maintenance, testing, and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia system.  The maintenance management system supports the routine preventive maintenance program, which in combination with BSE's employee and contractor training programs provides ongoing assurance that the anhydrous amm"

As such, the facility has not experienced an accident involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe BSE emergency response program is based on OSHA's Emergency Action Plan requirements under 29 CFR 1910.38.  This program has been discussed with the local dire departments and has been coordinated with Green County Emergency Management.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nBSE has trained employees on the safety hazards and operation of the anhydrous ammonia process to increase safety awareness among their employees.  The facility will continue to make safety improvements as identified by BSE employees, visitors, and contractors."
