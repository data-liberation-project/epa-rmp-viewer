From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of El Dorado Irrigation District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, El Dorado Irrigation District has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single worst case release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of chlorine on site, in this case, 2,000 lb.  This release scenario is not physically possible, due to the characteristics of chlorine.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn alternative case release scenario"

The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District provides water supply and distribution in El Dorado County.  Its water treatment facility, Reservoir 2/2A, is located off Snows Rd. in Camino, El Dorado County, CA, and uses chlorine, a RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located near Camino Union High School, south of Freeway 50.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site daily and also respond to alarm conditions.  \n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales inside the building.  The chlorine is used to control biological growth on the filters and to disinfect the treated water.  Pressurized chlorine gas wi"

The alternative case scenario is described in the ARP regulations as a likely release resulting in offsite effects, considering administrative controls and mitigation measures in place, and is to be determined by the facility operators as part of the Process Hazard Analysis required to be performed during RMP development.  The alternative case considered for this facility is the release of chlorine gas from a vacuum regulator relief vent due to improper valve seating, with the release secured by the responder closing the gas valve after 120 minutes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at El Dorado Irrigation District which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include El Dorado Irrigation District's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel following established emergency response procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by El Dorado Irrigation District are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.

These include, among other things, the creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIt is planned to eliminate chlorine at this site after the reservoir cover is installed within the next two years or so.  All of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which El Dorado Irrigation District committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
