The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment function as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Kenedy Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) does occur on a small scale, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, if it can be achieved safely.  Otherwise, it is ETP's policy to evacuate the facility and allow a fire resulting from a LOPC to burn itself out. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nThe Kenedy Gas Plant, located approximately 15.8 miles South West of Karnes City Texas on CR 173 operates a process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane and condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Kenedy Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It has the capability to process approximately 400 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas. The Kenedy Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel containing 322,145 pounds of NGL. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.55 mile.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Kenedy Gas Plant uses the HAZOP technique to perform these evaluations. This analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Change are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Kenedy Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommen"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Kenedy Gas\r\nPlant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Personnel from other gas plants participate in the Audit process. Both hourly and staff personnel participate. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Kenedy Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. Summary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Finding. The processes at the Kenedy Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation"

In addition the Kenedy Gas Plant has procedures that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated as necessary. Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. The overall emergency response program for the Kenedy Gas Plant is coordinated with the Karnes County LEPC. This coordination includes periodic meetings with the Karnes City Fire Department, local government officials, and industry representatives. The gas plant has around-the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department and sheriff department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic meetings, the gas plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations. The Kenedy Gas Plant provides training and equipment to local emergency responders so that they are familiar with any unique hazards that they may encounter when responding to emergencies at our facilities. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAlthough Kenedy Gas Plant management does not believe additional safety measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accident releases, it does resolve all findings from the Process Hazards Analysis and the Compliance Audits. Some of these findings result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes were implemented in response to PHA findings and the Compliance Audits:\r\n\r\n1. Revisi"

Because processes at the Kenedy Gas Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management(PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Kenedy Gas Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Kenedy Gas Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Kenedy Gas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Kenedy Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.
