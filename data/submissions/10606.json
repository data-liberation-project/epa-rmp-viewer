This\ncommitment   is  demonstrated  by  the   resources\ninvested  in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel  and considering safety in  the  design,\ninstallation,  operation, and maintenance  of  our\nprocess.  Our  policy  is to implement  reasonable\ncontrols   to  prevent  foreseeable  releases   of\nregulated  substances. However, if a release  does\noccur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\n The   Dollarhide  Gas  Plant,  located  35  miles\nsouthwest  of Andrews (Andrews County), Texas,  on\nHighway   128,  operates  a  process  to   produce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas\nliquids),  from  natural gas. The  Dollarhide  Gas\nPlant  has several regulated flammables,  such  as\npropane and butane. The Dollarhide Gas Plant  does\nnot   use  and/or  process  any  regulated   toxic\nsubstances above threshold quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n The  WCS  associated with a release of  flammable\nsubstances in the Program Level 1 process  at  the\ngas   plant  is  a  vapor  cloud  explosion  (VCE)\ninvolving the full inventory of the product  surge\ntank  containing  natural gas  liquids  (flammable\nmixture). A written procedure is in place to limit\nthe  tank  inventory to 100,000 lbs. (80%  of  the\nmaximum  tank  capacity); therefore,  the  reduced\ninventory  is  assumed  to  release  and   ignite,\nresulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-\npsi  endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile, resulting\nin  no  offsite impact. Although we have  numerous\ncontrols  to prevent such releases and  to  manage\ntheir   consequences,  no   credit   for   passive\nmitigation  measures  was taken  into  account"

The following is a  summary\nof the accident prevention program in place at the\nplant.  Because the process at the gas plant  that\nis   regulated  by  the  Environmental  Protection\nAgency's  (EPA's)  risk management  program  (RMP)\nregulation  is  also subject to  the  Occupational\nSafety   and   Health  Administration's   (OSHA's)\nprocess  safety  management (PSM)  standard,  this\nsummary  addresses each of the OSHA  PSM  elements\nand  describes the management system in  place  to\nimplement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n The Dollarhide Gas Plant encourages employees  to\nparticipate  in  all  facets  of  process   safety\nmanagement  and accident prevention.  Examples  of\nemployee  participation range  from  updating  and\ncompiling   technical   documents   and   chemical\ninformation  to participating as  a  member  of  a\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have\naccess  to all information created as part of  the\ngas  plant  accident prevention program.  Specific\nways  that  employees  can  be  involved  in   the\naccident prevention program are documented  in  an\nemployee participation plan that is maintained  at\nthe   gas   plant  and  addresses  each   accident\nprevention program element. In addition,  the  gas\nplant  has a number of initiatives under way  that\naddress process safety and employee safety issues.\nThese initiatives include forming teams to promote\nboth   process  and  personal  safety.  The  teams\ntypically have members from various areas  of  the\nplant,    including    operations,    maintenance,\nengineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant keeps  a  variety  of\ntechnical documents that are used to help maintain\nsafe  opera"

HAZOP analysis  is\nrecognized  as  one  of the  most  systematic  and\nthorough   hazard   evaluation   techniques.   The\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people  who\nhave  operating and maintenance experience as well\nas engineering expertise. This team identifies and\nevaluates  hazards  of  the  process  as  well  as\naccident  prevention and mitigation measures,  and\nthe   team   makes   suggestions  for   additional\nprevention  and/or  mitigation measures  when  the\nteam believes such measures are necessary.\n\n The  PHA  team  findings are forwarded  to  local\nmanagement   for  resolution.  Implementation   of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings  is\nbased  on a relative risk ranking assigned by  the\nPHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential\naccident  scenarios  assigned  the  highest   risk\nreceive    immediate   attention.   All   approved\nmitigation  options  in  response  to   PHA   team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed.

Incident investigation\nreports are retained for at least 5 years so  that\nthe reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and\nPHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n To  help  ensure  that  the  accident  prevention\nprogram  is  functioning properly, the  Dollarhide\nGas  Plant  periodically  conducts  an  audit   to\ndetermine  whether  the procedures  and  practices\nrequired  by  the accident prevention program  are\nbeing implemented. Compliance audits are conducted\nat  least  every  3  years. Personnel  from  other\nUnocal  facilities  who are knowledgeable  in  the\naudit  process participate as audit team  members.\nThe   audit  team  develops  findings   that   are\nforwarded  to gas plant management for resolution.\nCorrective actions taken in response to the  audit\nteam's   findings  are  tracked  until  they   are\ncomplete.

The following is a description  of\nexisting  safety features applicable to prevention\nof  accidental releases of regulated substances in\nthe facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n The   accident   prevention  program   summarized\npreviously  is applied to the RMP-covered  process\nat  the Dollarhide Gas Plant. Collectively,  these\nprevention   program   activities   help   prevent\npotential accident scenarios that could be  caused\nby equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant has safety features  on\nmany  units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n(2)  quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce  the\nconsequences   of  (mitigate)   a   release.   The\nfollowing types of safety features are used in the\ncovered process:\n\n Release Detection\n\n z     Hydrocarbon  detectors with alarms  in  the\n  engine room.\n z    H2S Monitors\n z    Ultra Violet detection in engine room\n\n Release Containment/Control\n\n z     Process relief valves that discharge  to  a\n  flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n z     Valves  to permit isolation of the  process\n  (manual or automated)\n\n z     Automated  shutdown  systems  for  specific\n  process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n z      Redundant  equipment  and  instrumentation\n  (e.g.,  uninterruptible power supply for process\n  control system, backup firewater pump)\n\n z    Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n Release Mitigation\n\n z    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n z    Deluge system for specific equipment\n\n z     Trained  personnel  in  emergency  response\n  procedures\n\n z    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical\n  protective  clothing,  self-contained  breathing\n  apparatus)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n The  Dollarhide Gas"

      "SummaryText": "Plant has an excellent record\n(no  incidents that resulted in onsite or  offsite\neffects)  of accident prevention over the  past  5\nyears.   If  an  incident  did  occur,  we   would\ninvestigate   the  incident  very   carefully   to\ndetermine  ways to prevent similar incidents  from\nrecurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant maintains  a  written\nemergency response program, which is in  place  to\nprotect  worker and public safety as well  as  the\nenvironment.  The program consists  of  procedures\nfor   responding  to  a  release  of  a  regulated\nsubstance, including the possibility of a fire  or\nexplosion if a flammable substance is accidentally\nreleased.  The procedures address all  aspects  of\nemergency response, including proper first aid and\nmedical treatment for exposures, evacuation  plans\nand  accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\nnotification of local emergency response  agencies\nand  the  public  if a release occurs,  and  post-\nincident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address\nmaintenance, inspection, and testing of  emergency\nresponse  equipment, as well as instructions  that\naddress  the use of emergency response  equipment.\nEmployees receive training in these procedures  as\nnecessary  to  perform  their  specific  emergency\nresponse duties. The emergency response program is\nupdated when necessary based on modifications made\nto  the gas plant process or other Dollarhide  Gas\nPlant facilities.\n\n The  overall emergency response program  for  the\nDollarhide  Gas  Plant  is  coordinated  with  the\nAndrews  County,  Texas, local emergency  planning\ncommittee   (LEPC).  This  coordination   includes\nperiodic meetings of the committee, which includes\nlocal    emergency   response   officials,   local\ngovernment      officials,      and       industry\nrepresentatives.  The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant  has\naround-the-clock  communications  capability  with\nappropriate"

This\nprovides  a  means of notifying the public  of  an\nincident,  if  necessary, as well as  facilitating\nquick  response  to an incident.  In  addition  to\nperiodic  LEPC meetings, the Dollarhide Gas  Plant\nconducts  periodic emergency drills that the  LEPC\nand  emergency response organizations are  invited\nto  participate  in,  and the gas  plant  annually\nprovides information to local emergency responders\nregarding  the hazards of regulated substances  in\nthe gas plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant resolves  all  findings\nfrom  PHAs,  some of which result in modifications\nto the process. The following types of changes are\nplanned  over  the next few years in  response  to\nPHA,  safety  audit,  and  incident  investigation\nfindings:\n\n z    Change out the fired heater for better burner\n  management and safety\n z     Replacing  the 1950 model compressors  with\n  more efficient units\n z    Disposal of asbestos"
