(Air Liquide) Freeport Hydrogen purification unit (Freeport HPU) proces  in located within the Dow Freeport complex  in Freeport, Texas.  The Freeport HPU process involves the recovery and purification of hydrogen from by-product raw gas feedstock. Freeport HPU is considered the covered process, as defined under the accidental release prevention regulations, as a flammable mixture process having in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n \nRegulated Chemical and Covered Process \nThe HPU process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using hydrogen rich byproduct raw gas feedstock streams from other chemical processes.   The purification is performed at elevated pressure. High pressure purified hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s).   The Freeport HPU is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nAir Liquide Freeport HPU is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.   The Freeport HPU process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  \nThe flammability of the process makes it necessary to put in place safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses the process safety system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n \nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite electronically that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.
