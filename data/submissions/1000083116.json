      "SummaryText": "The Chelan Fruit Co-Op System 4 facility is a fruit cold storage facility located outside the city of Chelan, County of Chelan, State of Washington.  Anhydrous Ammonia, used as a refrigerant in the system, is considered a highly toxic chemical by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with a toxic threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Chelan Fruit Co-Op System 4 has 10,300 pounds of ammonia in the closed-loop flooded system.  Safety precautions are followed by the facility to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce threat to personnel, the community and environment.\n\n\n\nThis facility was constructed in 2019 to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Chelan Fruit complies with OSHA, WA State Process Safety Management rules and regulations and IIAR Standards for Good Work Practices.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems include:\n\n   Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n   Suction trap hi-level float\n\n   High discharge pressure shut down\n\n   Low suction pressure shut down\n\n   High discharge temperature shut down\n\n   Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n   High amperes shut down\n\n   Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\n\n   Oil filters plugged shut down \n\n   250 psi relief valves on high and low pressure sides, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n\n\nThe facility has one engine room and 14 controlled atmosphere rooms.  The largest vessel is capable of holding 19,269 pounds of ammonia, which is more than the total amount of ammonia in the entire system.  If isolation was necessary, the vessel could hold al the ammonia in the system.  Isolation valves are located through out the system with remote operation and shutdown capabilities.  The Engine Room has outside kill switches and ammonia detectors. \n\n\n\nChelan Fruit Co-Op's refrigeration personnel do not respond to large releases of ammonia and have not received raining in accordanc"

      "SummaryText": "e with 29 CFR 1920.120.  Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate.  An Emergency Plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees will receive training on the plan annually.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department, and emergency drills are practiced each year.  The plan instructs coordinators to call 911, evacuate facility and wait for Emergency Responders to take control.  \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures and a system of Checklists and Calendars have been established for use by refrigeration personnel to insure safe operational functions.  Training on these procedures, ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity procedures will continue to be a major process at Chelan Fruit Co-Op System 4."
