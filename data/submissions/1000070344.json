Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs at the facility. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department. In the case of an ammonia related or sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor). The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 17000 E.

In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 135,000 pounds of ammonia in its four independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  The four systems (A, B, C, and D) each contain the following charge of ammonia: 38,000 pounds, 36,000 pounds, 36,000 pounds, and 31,000 pounds, respectively.  The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chillers, and suction accumulator, and Glycol Circulation System and Tank Jacket Heat Exchangers/Coolers), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to wine product and/or glycol.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 25 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\n\n\n\nThe facility has one sulfur dioxide filling station where hand-held dispensers are filled from a one-ton cylinder.  There is one central storage location where cylinders are delivered, and The Wine Group uses a forklift to move the cylinders to the filling station as needed.  There is a maximum of one (1) one-ton cylinder at the filling station and four (4) one-ton cylinders at the storage location. The facility also uses a mobile sulfur dioxide dispensing cart, used to add SO2 to the headspace of wine tanks. The cart is fitted with a single 100 pound sulfur dioxide cylinder.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Heal"

This prevention program covers those processes that handle sulfur dioxide and ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n \n\n?    Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\n?    In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n?    Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n?    Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n?    Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n?    Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n?    A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\n?    A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\n?    A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n\n?    Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n?    Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\n\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety.

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia or sulfur dioxide emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and alert the local emergency responders (fire department). The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nAmmonia Systems\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on March 27, 2018, there was one release of ammonia that meets this criteria in the past five years (March 2013 - March 2018). There was one injury that warranted an internal incident investigation from an ammonia release that occurred on April 8"

      "SummaryText": ", 2016. An employee was preparing equipment for painting when a valve was moved and ammonia vapor was released resulting in the employee sustaining ammonia inhalation and exposure to the head and face. The immediate area was evacuated, and the effected employee was sent to the hospital to be evaluated by medical professionals. The appropriate agencies (911, NRC, Cal-OES) were notified immediately and was notified of the amount of ammonia released (90 pounds) once the quantity was determined. The incident investigation compiled a list of recommendations with assigned persons and due dates, which have thus been completed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on March 27, 2018, no RMP reportable releases of Sulfur Dioxide have occurred over the past five years (March 2013 - March 2018) that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History (see above definition).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nChemical safety is an important part of The Wine Group, Inc. facility located in Ripon, California.  The Health and Safety committee as well as regulatory requirements have minimized chemical exposure risks to employees and the public through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts.  \n\n"
