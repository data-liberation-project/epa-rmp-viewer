Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs at the facility. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department. In the case of an ammonia related or sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor). The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 17000 E.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with farmland and residential areas.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Systems\n\n\n\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of grape juice, wine, and distilled spirits.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 135,000 pounds of ammonia in its four independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  The four systems (A, B, C, and D) each contain the following charge of ammonia: 38,000 pounds, 36,000 pounds, 36,000 pounds, and 31,000 pounds, respectively.  The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chillers, and suction accumulator, and Glycol Circulation System and Tank Jacket Heat Exchangers/Coolers), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to wine product and/or glycol.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 25 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\n\n\n\nThe facility has one sulfur dioxide filling station where hand-held dispensers are filled from a one-ton cylinder.  There is one central storage location where cylinders are delivered, and The Wine Group uses a forklift to move the cylinders to the filling station as needed.  There is a maximum of one (1) one-ton cylinder at the filling station and four (4) one-ton cylinders at the storage location. The facility also uses a mobile sulfur dioxide dispensing cart, used to add SO2 to the headspace of wine tanks. The cart is fitted with a single 100 pound sulfur dioxide cylinder.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Heal"
