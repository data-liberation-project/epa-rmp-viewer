Supply Co., P.O. box 557, Kersey Co. 80644 (970-353-2567)\n\nRisk Management Plan-Executive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners,management and employees of Centennial Ag. Supply of Greeley Co. are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of aqua ammonia. If an accidental release should occure, the faciliy is prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release to people and the envirnment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na)The facility has been owned and operated by Centennial Ag. since 1976. All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb)The primary activity of this facility as it relates to Aqua Ammonia is the storage of Aqua Ammonia for the manufacturing of liquid fertilizers for sale and distribution to growers for direct application as a crop nutreint.\n\nc)The maximum quantity stored in the largest tank is 30,369 pounds. There are two storage tanks on site. Aqua ammonia is manufactured on site.\n\n3> The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na)The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of the storage tank being released over a 74.5 minute period. The quanity release would equal approximately 30,369 pounds of Aqua Ammonia. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.51 miles.\n\nb) The alternate case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer pipe. The quantity released would equal approximately 600 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm is .09 miles).\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na)This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI puplication K-61.1,Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Ammonia.\n\nb)This facility is in compliance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Ammonia.\n\nc)This"
