The company also actively supports the Local\nEmergency Planning Commission with both monetary and personnel resources.\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substances\n2.1 Facility Description\nThe Morris plant is located a few miles northeast of the city of Morris, IL, just south of Route 6 on Tabler Road\nin Grundy County. The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying\nonly 26 acres. An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of waste water before it is\ndischarge to Aux Sable Creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs 122 people and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals,\nprimarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils. The basic raw materials are tallow\nand grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil.\nAdditional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation\nunits, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into\norganic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin. The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further\nprocessing into soap and personal care products.\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where the"

The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the\ncontinuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. The addition of\nacrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions can also be made in the batch hydrogenation units to form additional\nvariations of secondary and tertiary amines.\nIn the quaternization unit tertiary amines are reacted with methyl chloride to form quaternary ammonium compounds.\nThe major products produced at the site are primary, secondary and tertiary amines, diamines, esteramines,\nand quaternary ammonium compounds. These intermediates and products are used as surfactants in\nagricultural products, personal care products, detergents and fabric softeners. They are also used as\nsurfactants in a wide range of other industrial processes including food, chemical, highway paving, metal\nprocessing, mining, petroleum, paint, ink, paper, pharmaceutical, rubber and polymer processing industries.\n2.2\nRegulated Substances\nThe site has four substances that are covered by the Risk Management Plan regulations. These substances\nare all raw materials and are ammonia, acrylonitrile, methyl chloride and formaldehyde solutions. A fifth raw\nmaterial, hydrogen, is listed in the regulations but it is not covered by the regulation at the site because the\nmaximum quantity at the site is below the minimum threshold quantity listed in the regulation.\nThe maximum quantities of these materials in process at the plant site at anytime is as follows:\nAcrylonitrile421,000 lbs\nAmmonia531,000 lbs\nFormaldehyde Solutions361,000 lbs(as 100% Formaldehyde 167,000 lbs)\nMethyl Chloride722,000 lbs\nThe quantities for acrylonitrile, formaldehyde and hydrogen represent full storage tanks and one full delivery container.
