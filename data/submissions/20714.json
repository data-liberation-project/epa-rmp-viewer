When one of these detectors senses a gas leak of 1.0 ppm or above a visual and audible alarm on the annunciator panel will activate and a alarm will be transmitted to Control at district headquarters.\n\nAt 3.0 ppm the beacon lights on top of the effected building will come on and the ventilation fan in the room will start up to evacuate the room of excess gas.  These alarms can only be reset and cleared after the leak detectors sense less than 1 ppm of gas.  These alarms are tested by the operators twice a month.  In addition the communications shop inspects, tests and calibrates the chlorine alarm system on a monthly schedule. \n\nCALL OUTS\nWhen a gas leak alarm occurs during the hours the plant is staffed, the plant operators will respond to the leak with three operators.  The Chlorine Response Team can be dispatched to the plant during the staffed hours if the plant staff is unable to respond to the leak with a three person team.\n\nWhen Control receives a gas leak alarm after hours the control operator will call out the Chlorine Response Team and the sanitation standby operator.  Upon arrival both will wait at the entrance gate for the other to arrive and will enter the plant together.\n\nRESPONSE TO MINOR LEAKS\nTwo employees will respond with SCBA's, chlorine repair kit B, gloves and a bottle of 26 degree baume ammonia.  The Third Person will also respond with a SCBA and stay near the truck radio.\n\nThe First Person and Second Person will don their SCBAs, keeping each other in sight at all times.  Using the ammonia they will locate the leak.  Once the leak is located and is confirmed to be a system leak and not a vessel leak, the gas supply valve on the container can be shut off by turning the valve clockwise one full turn.  When this has been done the Third Person will let control know whether repairs have been made or if further assistance is needed.\n\nRESPONSE TO MAJOR LEAKS\nSame as above except the response team will wear f"

The Third Person will notify control to send police and fire department personnel to the scene to secure and evacuate the surrounding area if necessary.  The district's standby staff person and Training/Safety Specialist will be called as well.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO FACILITY\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems at this facility are under pressure, a system leak has the potential to allow several lbs of chemical to be released before emergency response personnel are able to take the appropriate steps necessary to bring the leak to a stop.  Plans are underway to change the pressure system to a vacuum system which would automatically stop drawing chemicals from the containers if the process system is adversely effected."

A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at all levels.  (IIPP)\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nNone to report\n\nWORST-CASE LEAK SCENARIO\nThis facility used EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68) for performing offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for the worst-case leak scenario.\n\nThe worst-case leak scenario is described in the compliance guide as the largest container losing all of it's contents in 10 minutes, this equates to a 200 lb/min leak of sulfur dioxide.  This facility is in a rural area and using the tables given in the complinace guide, a leak of this magnitude would effect a radius from the plant to 3.1 miles.\n\nIt is unlikely that a leak of this magnitude would occur because the process system is inspected daily and the chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are located in brick buildings that are monitored 24 hours a day for process leaks and all buildings have intruder alarms to guard against vandalism.  All plant operators and the Chlorine Response Team are trained to respond to and stop process leaks.\n\nALTERNATIVE LEAK SCENARIO\nThis facility uses the same compliance guide as mentioned above for performing the OCA for the alternative leak scenario.  A process hazard analysis PHA was performed on the chlorine and the sulfur dioxide systems at WRP #4 and it was determined that a more likely (yet not likely) leak scenario than the worst-case scenario, would be from the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the 1-ton containers to the manifold system.  This could occur through an earthquake, vandalism or material defects, but the mitigating factors that make these situations unlikely will be explained in anoth"

All plant operators are trained in emergency response.  The crew of employees trained jin response to chlorien leaks at domestic will sites have been trained to respond to chllorine/sulfur dioxide gas leaks at the WRPs as well.  This two person crew will respond jto plants after hours with the standby olperator to unmanned plants or to plants that need assistance.  There will always be three employees on call with pagers ready to respond to chlorine leaks.  The employees on call for chlorine response are rotated weekly.\n\nTRAINING\nChlorine response personnel are scheduled quarterly to be trained in use of emergency repair kits, personal protective equipment and emergency response procedures; scheduled annually to be trained in the hazards and handling of chlorine & CPR/First Aid.  The district has purchased a 1-ton container and a 150 lb cylinder to practice emergency repairs.\n\nALARMS\nWRP #4 is equipped with leak detectors that will detect chlorine/sulfur dioxide g"
