The substances are used in the treatment of wastewater at the Town of Vidalia facility located at 715 Logan Sewell Street, Vidalia, Louisiana.  The individual storage containers of the covered process exceed the threshold quantities outlined in 40 CFR Part 68; and, the containers for each substance are maintained in close enough proximity as to be considered one process for chlorine.  The facility process met the Program 2 criteria, because it did not qualify for consideration under Program 1 due to the distance of the nearest receptor within the impact areas identified during the evaluation of the worst-case scenarios, and did not qualify for Program 3, because the facility is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirement.   \n\nProgram 2 requirements include: 1) the development of a management program which identifies the responsibilities of management personnel relative to the Risk Management Program, 2) a Prevention Program to establish procedures and document information that will help to prevent an accidental release, 3) an Emergency Response Program that outlines the necessary procedures and contacts in the event of an accidental release, 4) and the evaluation of a worst case and alternate scenario of a potential release from the covered process.   \n\nThe Town of Vidalia Wastewater Treatment Plant has prepared specific accidental release prevention and emergency response policies to ensure the safety of employe"
