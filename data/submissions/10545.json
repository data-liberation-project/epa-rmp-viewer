These caverns, or wells, have a capacity of approximately two million barrels and contain brine as well as butane.\n\nWhen butane is pumped into a cavern, the brine is displaced and stored in brine pits.  When butane is transported to Port Arthur Refinery from the Sour Lake Storage Facility, brine is pumped from the pits into the cavern to displace the butane.\n\nThe Sour Lake caverns contain flammable hydrocarbons above the EPA RMP threshold quantity.  Hydrogen sulfide is also present but in quantities below the EPA RMP threshold quantity.\n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with the release of flammable substances at Sour Lake Storage is the separation of a four inch diameter butane line at the well-head of a cavern.  The result is the release of 75"

Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no credit for passive mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammables is the over-filling of a cavern with liquid hydrocarbon.  This scenario results in all of the brine being displaced; a total of 120,000 pounds of hydrocarbon being released into a brine pit; and the ignition of vapors resulting in a VCE. This scenario is also expected to have offsite consequences.\n\n4.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Port Arthur Refinery.  Because processes at the Sour Lake Storage Facility that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n4.1  Employee Participation\n\nPort Arthur Refinery encourages and incorporates employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team or incident investigation team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery accident prevention program.\n\nIn addition, Port Arthur Refinery incorporates employee participation in The Safety Steering Committee, The PSM Oversight Committee, The Joint Health & Safety Committee, Monthly Safety Meetings, Unit Team Meetings, Task Teams, The Safety Promotions Committee, The Emergency Response Team, and The Contractor Safety Committee.\n\n4.2  Process Safe"

      "SummaryText": "ty Information\n\nPort Arthur Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the Sour Lake Storage Facility.  These documents address the hazards of the chemicals in the processes, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used in the processes.  Standard Procedure H-9.5, Process Safety Information Required for PSM Compliance, outlines the Port Arthur Refinery procedure for developing, updating, and compiling process safety information.\n\nEmployees and contractors are informed of the location of process safety information that is relevant to their work.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  MSDSs are readily available through Port Arthur Refinery's computer system.  Port Arthur Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.\n\n4.3  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nPort Arthur Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\nPort Arthur Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise.   This"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Port Arthur Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard and analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer database and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution.  Final resolution of the findings is also documented in the database.\n\n4.4  Operating Procedures\n\nPort Arthur Refinery maintains Standard Procedure H-11, Operating Procedures and Operator Training, that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation from critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc, are included in operating procedures.\n\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, Port Arthur Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n4.5  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Port Arthur Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service unless special approval is given to use of the equipment, after it is determined what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Port Arthur Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n4.9  Hot Work Permit\n\nPort Arthur Refinery utilizes a comprehensive work permit system to safely manage all work performed at the facility.  In addition to hot work, the work permit system also includes requirements for entry into confined spaces, as well as requirements for other than hot work.  The existing work permit system serves as a framework for all other safe work practices.\n\n4.10  Management of Change\n\nPort Arthur Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operation conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\n4.11  Incident Investigation\n\nPort Arthur Refi"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and enters the information into a computer database for tracking.  Each recommendation is promptly assigned to an appropriate department for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented in the database, available for review by all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n4.12  Compliance Audits \n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits are periodically conducted to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Port Arthur Refinery's management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented in a computer database, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n5.0  CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sour Lake Storage Facility has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
