      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the LaRoche - Gramercy Plant\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries Inc. - Gramercy Facility are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nWe also have a thorough emergency response plan in place in which our employees and local responders are familiar with through periodic training.  Should a release occur that requires emergency response, the Saint John CAER, Saint James LEPC, and the Saint James Mutual Aid Organization stand ready to work with us to implement this plan and provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass two RMP-covered processes: Process 1 - Manufacture of Chlorine; and Process 2 - Manufacture of HCFC 141b.  We have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid], and Vinylidene chloride  [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-].  Of the four regulated substances, three are stored/handled at quantities greater than the Threshold Quantities. The fourth material is a trade secret material which is stored/handled in a manner that does not subject it to coverage under this regulation.  The regulated substances are involved in several uses at our facility.  Chlorine is manufactured from the electrolysis of a brine solution (salt water) in Process 1 and is used to treat our cooling water and as a process additive in Process 2.  In Process 2, Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric ac"

(1,766.5 tons) while Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid], and Vinylidene chloride  [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-] are present at our facility in quantities of approximately 340,000 lb. (170 tons), and approximately 175,000 lb. (87.5 tons), respectively.  These maximum inventory amounts listed above are a summation of all process vessels, piping, cylinders, etc. used to store/handle the chemicals.  \n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Similarly for alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  Neutral weather conditions are defined as D atmospheric stability and a windspeed of 3.0 m/s and worst-case weather conditions are defined as F atmospheric stability and a windspeed of 1.5 m/s.\n\nToxics - Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Chlor-Alkali Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 800,000 lb. (400 tons) of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nToxics - Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nOne alternative release scenario wil"

The scenario involves the release of 100 lb. of Chlorine.  The liquid chlorine is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.31 miles (1,637 feet).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride [Hydrofluoric acid] involves a release from Process Piping in the HCFC-141b process (Process 2).  The scenario involves the release of 49 lb. of Hydrogen fluoride in a gaseous form over 21 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L of Hydrogen fluoride is 0.06 miles (317 feet).\n\nFlammables - Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Tank #1 (TK-1) in the HCFC-141b process.  The scenario involves the release of 175,000 lb. (87.5 tons) of Vinylidene chloride  [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-].  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.27 miles (1,426 feet) is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nFlammables - Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank #1 (TK-1) in the HCFC-141b process.

The likelihood of an explosion involving the entire contents of Tank #1 is extremely low.  The regulation requires that the Alternate Release Scenario extend beyond the facility limits and the only scenario that meets that criterion is an explosion involving the entire contents of Tank #1.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.18 miles (950 feet).\n\n4.
