Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Plant Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nNestle's Freehold Plant produces and packages instant coffee and tea.  The facility uses ammonia in its refrigeration system as a heat transfer medium.  Ammonia is supplied to various end users in the processing of coffee and tea.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Freehold Plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation, and New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\no Employee Participation Program\n\no Process Safety Information\n\no Process Hazard Analysis\n\no Operating Procedures\n\no Training Program\n\no Contractor Safety Program\n\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\no Mechanical Integrity Program\n\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\no Management of Change Procedures\n\no Accident Investigation Procedures\n\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\n\n\nD.

Procedures related to personal protective equipment were modified following this incident.\n\n\n\nOn November 4, 2014 two contractors suffered OSHA recordable injuries when ammonia vapor was released from an auto purger.  The auto purger was modified following this incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Freehold Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n\n\no Facility Description\n\no Emergency Response Organization\n\no Emergency Response Procedures\n\no Notification Procedures\n\no Evacuation Procedures\n\no Mitigation Scenarios and Procedures\n\no Incident Termination Procedures\n\no Emergency Preparedness and Training\n\n\n\nThe program has been coordinated with the Freehold Borough Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\n\n\nF.
