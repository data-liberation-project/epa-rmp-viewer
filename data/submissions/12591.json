      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nSince 1958 Cabot Corporation has operated our 180 - acre fumed silica manufacturing site in Tuscola, Illinois.  Cabot is a global leader in the 200 million pound fumed silica industry.  We currently employ 232 people in Tuscola, operating the facility round-the-clock.Cabot Corporation, Cab-O-Sil Division (Cabot), located in Tuscola, Illinois produces amorphus fumed silica. Amorphous fumed silica is a versatile material that is made up of extremely small, very pure particles.  These particles are vital ingredients of a large number of products, including such common household items as toothpaste, cake mixes, nail polish, adhesives, cosmetics, automoblie finishes, inks, plastics, various types of rubber, as well as hundreds of other uses.  Some of the fumed silica products are approved as food additives for certain applications by the Food & Drug Administratiion, while others are used as strengthening agents or to control the flow of both powders and liquids.\n\nThe facility is subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements pursuant to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  The facility uses the following RMP toxic materials at the facility in quantities that exceed the thresholds set for each material:\n\n                      Material                             Quantity\nMethyltrichlorosilane (MTCS)         Greater than 5,000 pounds\nDimethyldichlorosilane (DiMeDi)     Greater than 5,000 pounds\n\n\nRMP CHEMICALS\n\nToxics\nMTCS is stored in large spherical tanks at a 100% concentration and as an 80% mixture with Silicon Tetrachloride (Siltet).  The largest quantity of MTCS in a sphere is 2,500,000 pounds (lbs).  Administrative controls are in-place which limit the total quantity of the MTCS in the spheres to 2,500,000 lbs.  The worst-case release scenario for MTCS was determined by assuming the entire quantity of MTCS in the tank is instantaneously released into an evaporating pool.  The release rate of MTCS was determined f"

      "SummaryText": "rom the EPA 'Offsite Consequence Analysis'. The tank is located in a diked area, which provides passsive mitigation by reducing the entire surface area of the release.  Further reduction of the surface area is accomplished through the use of additional passive mitigation in the form of two layers of polyethylene plastic balls which cover approximately 97% of the surface area of a released liquid.  Modeling this release using the SLAB model results in a distance to the defined endpoint that is beyond the facility boundary.\n\nDiMeDi is stored in a smaller, bullet-shaped tank located in a diked area, with a maximum stored quantity of 290,000 pounds.  The use of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidelines for the worst-case release of a toxic liquid provides a greater distance to an endpoint for 100% MTCS than for a worst-case release of DiMeDi.\n\nMTCS is conveyed to the point of reaction through a dedicated 3-inch diameter pipe.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario for MTCS is a pipe break at the discharge of the pump resulting in the entire cross-sectional area of the pipe opened. The entire duration of the release is assumed be about ten minutes by which time the affected section of pipe would be valved off and the release stopped.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated using the SLAB model, and does not extend beyond the facility boundries.\n\nThe DimeDi is not shown since the distance to the toxic endpoint of both the worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario is less than the distance to the toxic endpoint of the MTCS.\n \nRMP APPLICABILITY\n\nCabot is subject to Program 3 RMP requirements for toxics due to the following:\n\n* RMP substances in process above the RMP threshold quantities\n* Public receptors within the worst-case release endpoint (toxics)\n* Processes at the facility are covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements\n* Specifically"

Their safe use at our Tuscola site is the highest priority of everyone at Cabot; there is no obligation we take more seriously.  Cabot is dedicated to the safe handling of all chemicals as well as the safe and proper operation of all facility equipment.  The PSM Plan includes policy and procedures for handling chemicals as well as operating and maintaining the equipment in use at the facility.  Cabot reviews these policies and procedures on a regular basis for accuracy and with the intent for continual improvement.  The PSM Plan can be found at the Site in the office of the Health and Safety Manager."
