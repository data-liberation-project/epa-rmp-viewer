      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWM Barr Facility and Operations\n\nWM Barr and Company, Inc., an employee-owned company, operates two manufacturing facilities in an industrial area in Memphis, Tennessee.  WM Barr has two distinct business divisions, Total Solutions Group (TSG), and Custom Packaging Group (CPG).  Through the TSG division, we manufacture products with formulas owned by WM Barr, and, in the CPG side, we manufacture products with customer-owned formulas.  Although the two sales divisions are distinct, they share manufacturing processes.\n\nManufacturing at WM Barr consists primarily of chemical blending and packaging.  Raw materials are received on-site via barge, rail and truck and stored in above ground storage tanks.  The materials are then piped into the plants, blended in batch tanks to formula specifications, and packaged into small containers (pint, quart, gallon, etc.) for ultimate shipment to customers or customer designated consumers.  WM Barr has a warehouse and distribution center for storage of finished goods and shipment.\n\nThe manufacturing facility located at 2170 Buoy St. requires a Risk Management Program.  The RMP flammable substances at the affected facility are dimethyl ether, n-butane, propane, and isobutane.  All of these flammables are stored in the aerosol tank farm in bulk and are used as propellant for aerosol products.  Though only one WM Barr facility currently requires an RMP, the safety and response programs, employee training, and other features of the Program are present at all WM Barr facilities.\n\n\nWM Barr Safety Policy\n\nWM Barr's safety policy is to ensure that no activity takes place unless it can be completed in a safe manner.  The President/CEO has ultimate responsibility for the safety and health of employees and others affected by our operations.  It is his function to individually assume leadership and direction of the safety and health program.  Consistent with good management practice, he delegates auth"

      "SummaryText": "ority and responsibility for safe operation through all management levels.  There is a staff of three regulatory, environmental, safety and health professionals who administer the safety and health program on a full time basis.\n\nWM Barr's safety pledge is that people, methods and safety awareness make all accidents preventable.  No job is so important and no production so urgent that we cannot perform our work safely.  All employee-owners must be responsible and accountable for performing their tasks safely and are encouraged to exercise good judgment and use their common sense at all times in all places.\n\nSafety audits and accident investigations are used to identify and correct unsafe conditions, unsafe acts, and to promote safety awareness.  Corrective action is taken where needed.  WM Barr is committed to providing the resources and ongoing safety training necessary to prevent accidents and industrial illness, and to maintain an orderly and clean workplace.  It is the company's desire to make safety such a part of our culture that it becomes a way of life at work and at home.\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nAll employees who work in and around the processes where regulated chemicals are present, and all other processes, are  trained in the safe and proper manner to perform job duties.  All work procedures and instructions are documented and employees are periodically trained.  All documented work procedures and instructions incorporate a sfety component which addresses the steps or precautions (such as PPE or hot work permits) of which an employee performing a particular task should follow.  Safety training is also incorporated into job position requirements.  It is notable that WM Barr has never had an accident or unpermitted release involving any RMP regulated substance.\n\nThe process that contains RMP regulated substances has multiple safety features built into it to prevent a release.  The tank farm operator performs all unloading of tanker trucks.  The tank fa"

      "SummaryText": "people and processes give us a high level of confidence that the occurrence of an emergency involving a RMP regulated substance is highly unlikely.  However, we have contingency plans in place to manage such events.  Employees working in and around the processes where regulated chemicals are present, and all other processes, are trained to respond to emergencies.  Furthermore, WM Barr has an Emergency Response Team (ERT), comprised of trained and experienced cross-functional employees.  Response training is conducted periodically.  An internal communications system is in place to notify ERT members of an emergency and its location.  The ERT is available to respond 24 hours a day.\n\nWM Barr also works closely with other industry and the local fire department (which has a Hazmat Team) and is an active member of the LEPC.  This will allow for a seamless coordination of response efforts.  In the event that there is an incident which WM Barr's ERT is incapable of handling, there is a fire station located in the industrial park 2-3 miles from the farthest WM Barr facility.  A community-wide Emergency Notification System is in place which allows for the rapid notification of the affected community of the emergency and its nature, and also contacts emergency personnel needed for response activity.  It bears repeating however, that there are no public receptors affected even by our worst case scenario.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAt WM Barr, we take safety very seriously.  Our employees have an above average commitment to safety because of our safety program and training, and because our employees own the company.  We are 100% employee-owned through our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  Furthermore, we have taken all reasonable precautions to ensure that we handle all chemicals safely and responsibly.  We have had no releases of any RMP regulated substance in our company's 50 year history of manufacturing.  We believe that a large release is extremely unlikel, and we are properly staf"

      "SummaryText": "rm unloading area has a manual cutoff switch to stop the flow into storage tanks.  The piping to storage tanks is routed through a bulkhead to prevent it from being displaced where it attaches to the tank (and thereby causing a rupture of the tank).  Piping into storage tanks from the unloading area and from the tanks and into the manufacturing facility is equipped with backflow and excess flow valves.  Storage tanks have fusible links, which close valves if fire is detected.  All storage tanks were certified by a qualified engineer when installed.\n\nThe aerosol tank farm where the substances are stored has a 6 feet high chain link fence with barbed wire.  The facility's perimeter is also fenced and access is controlled through one employee entrance and exit.  All parking lots and the employee entrance/exit are on 24-hour videotape surveillance.  Access by tanker truck is controlled with a locked gate that the tank farm operator manually unlocks and locks to allow tanker trucks to enter and exit the facility.  Plant equipment is inspected regularly and receives timely maintenance as part of the company's Preventative Maintenance Program.  In addition to the PM Program, routine audits of operating processes are conducted by WM Barr and third parties and any necessary corrective action taken.\n\nPropellant is piped from the storage tank into the aerosol production area.  This area is separated from the rest of the plant by a fire wall and it is equipped with sensors to detect the presence of propellant in the air.  If the level of propellant reaches 20% LEL, exhause fans activate.  If the level reaches 40% LEL, the entire filling process shuts down:  production ceases, tank valves seal to prevent additional propellant from entering the process, and an accelerated exhaust system engages.  This production area is also equipped with a deluge fire extinguishing system that is designed to flood the entire area with a massive amount of water.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOur"
