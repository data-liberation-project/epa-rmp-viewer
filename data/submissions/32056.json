      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material. The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling this chemical to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Reedley operates a 2.77 million gallon per day (MGD) wastewater treatment plant and disposal facility.  Disposal is to 23 acres of percolation-evaporation basins with an underdrain system.  Treated effluent is also available for farm irrigation.  During a three to four month period during the winter, when the evaporation rate is not sufficient to supplement the percolation capacity of the ponds, and when the Kings River is flowing at a rate to provide an adequate dilution rate, excess, treated, percolated, disinfected and dechlorinated effluent can be diverted to the Kings River.  Chlorine gas is injected into water to form a concentrated chlorine solution.  This solution is then mixed with water received from the percolation pond subdrains for disinfection  prior to discharge into the Kings River.\n\nThe chlorine is received in one ton containers.  Gaseous chlorine is obtained from a one ton container connected by a vacuum regulator to a chlorinator which feeds the chlorine gas under vacuum to an injector where the chlorine gas is injected into a water flow.\n\n3a. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and pr"

      "SummaryText": "eferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\n\n3b. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and the related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine within the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from outside the facility at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  This response can be incorporated into the Area Plan by the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nAny commitments made for scheduled mitigation actions are listed in the element (e) (i.e. Process Hazard Analysis) of the Process Safety Management (PSM) document. These mitigation actions are being implemented at this time for the next year and-a-half. Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the chlorine syst"
