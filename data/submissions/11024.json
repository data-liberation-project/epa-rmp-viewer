If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a group of experts (e.g., engineers, etc.) review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the equipment until the deficiency can be corrected.\n\nAnother integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.  This facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to help ensure new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials/spare parts are used for repairs.\n\nHot Work and Other Safe Work Practices -\nThis facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include orientations for visitors/contractors, control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure to help ensure precautions are taken before entering confined spaces, job safety analyses to identify and mitigate hazards associated with maintenance tasks).  These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) -\nThis facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training related to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation -\nThis facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during the next HAZOP revalidation.\n\nCompliance Audits -\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, an audit is conducted at this facility at least once every 3 years to determine whether the program's procedures and practices are being implemented.  An audit team consisting of both facility and technical personnel evaluate the implementation/effectiveness of the processes in this accident prevention program and develop findings that are documented and forwarded to management to coordinate resolution.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the specific regulated substances (i.e., flammable mixture, hydrogen sulfide) in this facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities -\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at this facility.  These prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Features -\nThis facility has safety features on many units to (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release, and (3) reduce/mitigate the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used:\n\nRelease Detection ...\n- Open flame & flammable gas detectors/alarms near gas turbines\n- Toxic substance detectors/alarms throughout the facility\n- Hydrocarbon gas detectors/alarms in processing areas\n- Portable hydrocarbon and toxic gas detection\n\nRelease Containment/Control ...\n- Pressure/thermal relief valves and rupture disks that discharge into a flare system for incineration\n- Manual/automatic isolation valves\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., pressure, high level, etc.)\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., dual relief valves, etc.)\n- Automatic and manual system and facility emergency shut down systems (ESD)\n\nRelease Mitigation ...\n- Fire extinguishing systems (e.g., portable fire extinguishers)\n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThis facility has had an excellent record for accident prevention over the past 5 years.

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1992 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nThe Black Canyon Dehydration Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it.  Additional details are included in other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThis facility, located 17 miles Northwest of LaBarge, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes one primary operation (dehydration) to prepare the natural gas mixture for transport to the Exxon Company, U.S.A. Shute Creek Facility for processing.  This facility could contain up to 96,000 pounds of regulated flammables (i.e., mixture containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane) used for fuel and 19"

This technique is recognized by OSHA as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, this plant updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures -\nThis facility maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, cold startup) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented for each employee.\n\nContractors -\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce for routine maintenance or construction.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, this facility has procedures in place to help ensure contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards they find during their work.
