      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan (RMP)\r\nRogue Valley Terminal Railroad Corporation  - Propane Storage\r\n White City, Oregon\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nRogue Valley Terminal Railroad Corporation (RVTRC) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of RVTRC's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes.  It is RVTRC's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. These controls include employee training, equipment inspections, and ambient air monitoring.  In the context of this Risk Management Plan, storage of rail tank cars loaded with propane in the form of liquified petroleum gas is the only process that occurs at the facility. RVTRC depends upon and coordinates with RVTRC, the Jackson County Fire District No. 3, and the Jackson County Emergency Management to provide emergency response and response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility's primary activity is receiving, storage, and shipping Propane and/or Butane as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in railcars. Railcars are placed on a rail siding, secured against unwanted movement and protected from collision with other cars/trains, stored for up to one (1) year, then transported to customers in California. Each 33,000-gallon capacity railcar contains up to 130,000 pounds of propane LPG or 145,000 pounds of butane LPG. Up to 125 rail cars may be stored on site; therefore, the maximum amount of LPG stored at the facility is 16,250,000 pounds propane and 18,197,500 butane.\r\n\r\n3.\tWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \r\nRMP*Comp was utilized to evaluate worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required off-site consequence analysis for the facility.

      "SummaryText": "ncluded in Section 4 of this Plan and summarized below. Several factors protect tank car(s) from damage (e.g., from collision, vandalism, or attack) and subsequent uncontrolled release of propane. These DOT 112 tank cars are constructed from 0.6-inch fusion welded high tensile steel, jacketed for thermal protection, and have an outer steel skin. Testing performed by the Federal Railroad Administration (RR 14-30, August 2014) indicate they can withstand 2.1 million foot-pounds of impact energy from a one (1) ft2 ram. Tank cars will be protected from unintentional movement and collision by setting handbrakes on parked cars and by locking out switches. Valves and fittings on each tank car are located under a protective steel housing on the top center of the tank. A pressure relief valve prevents over-pressuring, and a safety check valve limits the flow rate from the loading/unloading valve. Reasonable release scenarios are limited to a malfunctioning valve(s) or fitting(s), or intentional release by partially opening the loading/unloading valve such that flow would not trigger the safety check valve.\r\n\r\nA worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of all tank cars stored at the facility and ignition of the resulting vapor cloud. Administrative controls or mitigation that would affect the release rate were not included in this scenario. At Stability Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), the maximum distance to an endpoint of one (1) pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure (endpoint fixed by regulation) is 2 miles for propane (Figure 2) and 2.1 miles for butane (Figure 4). CensusViewer estimates 4,322 persons (2010 census) within 2.5 miles and 4,886 persons within 2.2 miles.\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of one (1) tank car. In the alternative scenario, 127,500 pounds of propane is released and the resulting vapor"

      "SummaryText": "cloud ignited. For butane, the one railcar release scenario is 145,000 pounds. The release is assumed to be undetected while ongoing and at a rate that does not trigger the flow-limiting check valve (8 hrs); therefore, active mitigation is not considered. At Stability Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), the maximum distance to an endpoint of one (1) pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure (endpoint fixed by regulation) is 0.4 miles (Figure 3 and Figure 5) for both propane and butane releases.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place for the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nRVTRC will maintain a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (see Appendix A - SDS, DOT 112 Rail Car Spec).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nA hazard analysis was completed as part of this Plan. Major hazards identified include fire and explosion. Process controls include the following:\r\n\u00bf\tRailcar construction that is resistant to puncture and heat;\r\n\u00bf\tLocked protective housings over all valves and fittings to discourage unauthorized access;\r\n\u00bf\tPressure relief valves to prevent tank over-pressuring; and,\r\n\u00bf\tSafety check valves to limit flow rate and prevent uncontrolled release of tank contents to atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nRVTRC will maintain written operating procedures to ensure that activities within the covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures will address various modes of operation. The information will be regularly reviewed and is r"

RVTRC requires that any cars leased from the Tank Car Supplier are maintained in accordance with applicable regulatory and industry standards (e.g., 49 CFR Part 180 Subpart F - Qualification and Maintenance of Tank Cars, and Association of American Railroads Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices, Section C-III, Specifications for Tank Cars). The Tank Car Supplier maintains detailed maintenance records.\r\n\r\nThe Tank Car Supplier performs inspections at a frequency of at least every 10 years. Where manufacturers of valves and fittings recommend a shorter inspection interval, the Tank Car Supplier follows the manufacturers recommendation. Inspections and testing include bubble leak tests, ultrasonic testing of weld seams, thickness gaging, heat testing, and bench testing of valves prior to installation and at the manufacturer-recommended frequency.\r\n\r\nRVTRC also performs, or causes to be performed, inspections to ensure tank cars have been delivered secure and leak-free. Visual inspections are performed to confirm cable seals and/or padlocks are present and intact on the protective housing covering valves and fittings. A combustible gas meter is used to confirm the absence of leakage from valves and fittings.

Procedures for safe movement and delivery of railcars are described in RVTRC's operating manuals. Tank cars will be placed on the siding in a coupled state. The railcars will be secured against unwanted movement in accordance with RVTRC's Air Brake and Train Handling Rules. At a minimum, hand brakes will be set on an adequate number of rail cars to prevent movement. Other measures to prevent unwanted railcar movement (e.g., rail clamping wheel blocks, chocks, car stops, bump posts) may be used, as needed.
