Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Cartex Corporation, as part of the Woodbridge Group of companies, believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, should be of the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\n- Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental improvements.\n\nOur complete Heath Safety & Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility. \n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule. \n\n2.

The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals immediately prior to pouring the mixture into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously moving line. The mold moves through a curing oven. Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, crushed, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers. Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck.  It is stored in two tanks located in a contained room. The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 275,000 pounds. \n\n3.   Off-site consequence analysis scenarios \n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenario's for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.  \n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint as established by the RMP rule was the Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (Aloha) version 5.2.1. for plume modeling.  Meteorological information was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center.  The parameters used for the model were 98 degrees F, 67% average relative humidity, 1.5 meters/second wind speed and class F stability.  An urban environment was assumed due to the characteristics of the local terrain.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nCatastrophic failure of a railcar full of TDI at the railsiding, discha"

As there is no containment at the railsiding, it is assumed that a pool with a depth of 1 cm is formed and evaporates to form a cloud that disperses downwind. The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/l is 651 feet or 0.12 miles.  No residential population would be affected by this worst-case scenario event.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA bulk storage tank ruptures discharging its entire content of 224,000 pounds of TDI in a concrete diked area.  The puddle area is 3131 square feet.  It is assumed that the maximum temperature TDI could reach in the tank is  95 degrees F. The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L is 90 ft or 0.02 miles.  No residential population would be affected by this alternative release scenario event.  \n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: \n\n- Safety information \n- Hazard reviews of our processes\n- Operating procedures\n- Training\n- Equipment Maintenance Program\n- RMP Compliance Audits\n- Accident/Incident Investigation\n\nIn addition, we have an established Isocyanate Control Program which outlines the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls which are in place to reduce the hazards of isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community and the environment. \n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

Our program provided essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. We have coordinated our program with the local emergency planning committee and the fire department. A representative of the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAt this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety management systems.  In addition, based on recommendations generated during the hazard review, we are investigating the possibilities for secondary containment of our railsiding,  installing high level alarms on all bulk storage tanks, revising our unloading procedures for TDI,  and developing additional procedures for inspecting and testing TDI piping.  Our preventative maintenance programs for the overall TDI system will also be revised."
