It produces fuel-grade ethanol from corn through a fermentation process.  The spent grains, or Distillers Dried Grains and Solubles, is sold as animal feed and a portion of the carbon dioxide generated during fermentation also recovered and sold.\n\nUnited Ethanol, LLC is required by law to denature its ethanol product prior to shipment.  A liquid petroleum based blend is used which includes three regulated flammable substances; pentane, isopentane and butane.  The denaturant is stored in an outdoor, 2,031 barrel (85,000 gallon) storage tank surrounded by a 58A\u00c2\u00bf high secondary containment dike.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION RESPONSE POLICY\nUnited Ethanol, LLC is committed to managing the facility in accordance with relevant regulations and good manufacturing practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the storage tank.  If an accidental release was to occur, United Ethanol, LLC has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.  \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nIn assessing the ramifications of a worst case release scenario, United Ethanol, LLC employed the latest available version of USEPAA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*COMP software.  The objective was to estimate the distance to the flammable endpoint for a mixture containing the regulated organics pentane, isopentane and butane.  Data for the model was supplied by the Material Safety Data Sheets from our vendor.  It was the source for physical data such as liquid density and concentrations of the three qualified components.  Since this data was supplied as a potential range of values all were assumed for the purpose of the model to be in the middle.  Furthermore the model assumes that a full denaturant storage tank (85,000 gallons or 500,000 lbs) was released."

      "SummaryText": "Also accounted for was the presence of a 58A\u00c2\u00bf high concrete containment dike as well as the outdoor release.  The software calculates the flammable endpoint of pentane and isopentane defined as the distance to an overpressure of 1 psi and by a radiative energy exposure of 5 kilowatts per square meter.  The resulting calculation indicated that this distance is less than 0.4 miles.  Landview 6 software downloaded from the US Census Bureau estimated that there are no (zero) public receptors within this affected area.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe facility has not been in operation for five years so it has no history.  No accidental release has occurred in the past five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nUnited Ethanol, LLC has developed an emergency response plan and an emergency action plan that provides procedures for:\n\n(1)\tinforming the public and local emergency response agencies about an accidental release;\n(2)\tfirst aid and emergency medical treatment for employees;\n(3)\temergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n(4)\tthe availability of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance;\n(5)\ttraining all employees in relevant procedures; and\n(6)\temergency response plan review and update.\n\nUnited Ethanol, LLC employees receive emergency response training annually.  In the event of an emergency, United Ethanol, LLC has a plant-wide alarm and notification system for notifying facility personnel.  During an environmental release accident, the shift supervisor is responsible for implementing the chemical release procedure as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.  In addition, the plant manager is responsible for public notification.\n\nCHANGES TO SAFETY\nUnited Ethanol, LLC developed a set of procedures, as part of the Management of Change sysltem, to identify and determine if major modifications are conducted properly, and to ensure that employees are notified about and understand the rami"
