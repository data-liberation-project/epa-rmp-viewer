In addition, MarkWest employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP program, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analyses. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nPeriodically, MarkWest hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is undertaken.  MarkWest has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards relating to the contractor's work and the associated processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nMarkWest has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe Scioto County, Ohio and the Greenup County, Kentucky LEPC's are the local emergency response agencies with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\n\r\nOne major development has resulted from the implementation of the various elements of this accidental release program: modification of the tank car loading area.

These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

(MarkWest) - Siloam facility located in South Shore, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Greenup County, Kentucky and Scioto County, Ohio Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses processing, storage, and wholesale distribution of various liquified petroleum gases (LPGs).  The following LPGs are present at the facility: propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes), and mixed feed natural gas liquids (a combination of all the previously mentioned LPGs commonly referred to as Y-grade).  All of these substances are regulated due to their flammable and explosive nature.  \r\n\r\nThe facility receives the mixed feed Y-grade from pipeline, tank truck, and rail car.  The Y-grade is stored in above ground vessels and then processed at the facility into propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline.  These products are stored in both above ground vessels and also, in the case of propane and normal butane, in underground caverns.\r\n\r\nThese products are then distributed from the facility by tank truck, rail car, and, in the case of normal butane, isobutane"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the underground propane storage cavern.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the cavern, approximately 8.2 million gallons (34.44 million pounds) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour), the maximum distance of 2.63 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure. \r\n\r\nUtilizing Landview III and Marplot software, the worst case scenario radius of 2.63 miles is illustrated in the graphic file siloamwc.jpg (electronic version) and in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).  Major industrial facilities located within this radius include North American Refractories, New Boston Coke, and OSCO Industries.

Finally, eight schools are located within the 2.63 mile radius: Mckinley Middle, Highland Elementary, Wilson Elementary, Oak Street Elementary, Glenwood High, Stanton Elementary, Mckell Middle, and Mckell Elementary.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from one of the vessels in the propane storage process.  Vessel SV-200 was arbitrarily selected for use in this scenario.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 51,936 gallons (218,132 lbs) of propane (this quantity is 90% of the entire available capacity of the vessel).  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral weather conditions (wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour), the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \r\n\r\nThe alternative case scenario radius of 0.3 miles is illustrated in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).
