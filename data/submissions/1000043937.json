The natural gas liquids extracted include ethane, propane and a butane-gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via pipelines.  Plant processes include:  compression, treating (amine system), cyrogenic plant and sulfur recovery unit (treater emission control).\n\nThe Monument Plant implements both administrative and engineering controls on the equipment in each process order to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.  Everything in the prevention plan applies to our entire facility as a whole.\n\nThe Monument Plant has many safety features integrated throughout the facility.  These features include failure alarms, flare and vent system designed to protect equipment from overpressuring during upsets, emergency shutdown system with isolation valves, automated control and shutdown instrumentation, hydrocarbon detection system, H2S detection system and PPE with trained personnel.",

This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Monument Plant is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site in above ground storage tanks and underground storage caverns.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane, and a pentane-natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via pipeline and transport vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\n\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a complete failure of the largest tank on-site.  This type of scenario is very unlikely to occur.  In addition qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventive ma"

The result of the release would have an offsite impact.  EPA's RMPComp was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily, the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, which further reduces the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\n\n\n    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals),   1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within the workforce.\n\n\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has"
