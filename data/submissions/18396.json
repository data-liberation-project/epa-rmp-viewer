      "SummaryText": "Management at the City of York is committed to policies that ensure the health and safety of the public and employees of the wastewater treatment plant.  The City of York WWTP is located west of secondary road S-46-1172 (Park Place Road) and approximately one mile south of road 1172 bridge over Fishing Creek.  At the City of York WWTP, only one hazardous process exists:  the gas chlorination system.  Chlorine is used as a disinfection agent for treated wastewater.  A chlorination building contains the process for injecting chlorine gas into the wastewater.  A storage dock contains the one-ton cylinders.  The maximum amount of chlorine to be stored will not exceed 4,000 lbs. (2 each ton cylinders).  Based on the rupture of one cylinder, the maximum impact would be 2,000 lbs.  The alternative scenario of a pipe leak would have a less severe impact, due to disbursement into the atmosphere over a longer period of time.  The City of York WWTP has never had a major chlorine problem, due to the following engineering and administrative controls:  1.  Engineering controls consist of:  a) automatic and manual control chlorinator; b) gas exhaust system; c) leak detection; d) ton container hoist; e) container securement block system.  2.  Administrative controls consist of:  a) written operating procedures; b) City of York safety program.  In the event of an emergency, the City of York Fire Department, EMS, York County Emergency Preparedness, as well as other agencies are prepared to respond.  We regularly review and update our plan to reflect any changes that are needed."
