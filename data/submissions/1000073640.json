This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at the facility.  The Enable Midstream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nEnable Midstream operates Stockman located in Shelby County, Texas.  Stockman is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by mechanical refrigeration with water removal by glycol dehydration.  The LPG, a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and C6+ compounds, is stored in a pressurized bullet tank for transportation by truck.  Condensate and produced water is also stored in a pressurized bullet tank for transportation from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Stockman is a Program 1 RMP process.\n\n\n\nOperations at the Stockman Plant were evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Stockman Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that m"

In the case of an accidental release, the Enable Midstream employee will activate the emergency shutdown system if possible and evacuate upwind of the release.  They will immediately notify the local fire department who will then respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nEnable Midstream is committed to operating the Stockman Plant in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment.  Enable Midstream personnel have an opportunity to make suggestions that could improve the safety of this facility during monthly regional safety meetings.  Enable Midstream will also conduct facility inspections and make improvements to safety based on findings of the inspections."
