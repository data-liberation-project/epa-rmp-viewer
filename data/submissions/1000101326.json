The vendor supplies chlorine and sulfur dioxide via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders. The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes. Workers who perform operations involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures according to the guidelines required by The City of Amarillo River Road Water Reclamation Plant.\n\n5.0 Five Year Accident History\nThere has been 1 accident on July 3, 2021 in the sulfonation process that resulted in an injury to an employee at The City of Amarillo River Road Water Reclamation Plant in the past five years. The public and environment were not affected. \n\nFindings\n1. During the investigation it was identified that James had no formal training. When asked he stated he was told \u0093to hold your breath and get away\u0094 He also stated it was explained to him \u0093if your smell goes away, your gone.\u0094 There are no records of training records for the employees at the facility.\n\n2. When maintenance plans and schedules were discussed, there is a Maintenance Program in place but not used to full potential. RRWWTP stated the program was out of date and could not be updated. Follow up visit to IT showed this was correct the current program cannot be updated with the design of the current program set up. But the system can be used as it is currently set up, just no updates can be done. Maintenance records kept in logbooks at the work sites not centrally controlled.\n\n3. The valve that failed was installed during the upgrade 3-4 years ago, when questioned on maintenance schedule on this piece of equipment. Manpower and Software were discussed. The plant previously had 4 mechanics and one electrician. Currently 2 on staff, which work 4 ten hours sh"

The PPE that was in place was not adequate for the job. Face shield on top of the locker was dirty and does not look like it has been used. It was also identified that there are no SCBS\u0092s at the location, full face respirators are on location, but no Respiratory protection plan or fit testing in place for the facility.\n\n5. There is a SOP that is in place at the worksite that is detailed and covers most of the aspect of doing the job required. This was one instance where the SOP did not cover what was needed, there was no troubleshooting procedures in place. (Pictures 10,11,12 and 14)\n\n6. Plant maintenance team understands that if a valve is hard to open, secure and notify supplier of this. Difficult valves are not supposed to be opened; it was discussed in the interviews that this is accepted practice. No documentation found during interviews for this. A separate SDS from Praxair, list valve difficulty in Section 7\n\n7. James has been on the job approximately 3 months, he told me his benefits kicked in this weekend was the reason he knew that. The other operator has been on the job approximately 1 year.\n\n8. No JSA or risk assessment in place for this operation. There are two JSAs showing the in intranet for RRWWTP. There are detailed SOP but does not cover all aspects of the job and potential hazards.\n\n9. SDS was in place in the SOP binder (picture 10 and 12) this SDS identifies that an emergency eye wash and shower need to be in the area, there is a pressurized water wash down system in the building.\n\n10. More than one person made that statement it will happen if you work around it. This was at this facility and one other that I spoke to about this to get some background information. Finding is, it is an acceptable hazard to the work force.\n\n11. The Antero software that is used for the maintenance licen"

The sessions are recorded, and you receive copies of the sessions. On-site Training - $1,500.00/first day, $1,200.00 for each additional day, plus travel expenses, after the license fee is paid. Osage WTP paid the support fee in the past, it increased to 4000.00 for renewal this year, the fee was discussed and with the lack of support for log in, change of maintenance tickets, and update issues due to the age of Citrix server application Antero was not able to be updated and Osage and River Road both stated the program was not user friendly, it was not renewed. IT confirmed the updating issues with the program. The other plants did not know the other was using the program, Osage spoke about the difficulty in getting log in for employees due to turnover with the previous log in, due retiring or leaving the City.\n\n12. Cell phones are the primary means of communication for the employees on the plant. Radios are provided, staff said there is a lot of cross traffic. One reason they do not use, second reason some areas of the plant you cannot get signals in and out.\n\n13. Reviewed a few different SDS for this chemical, there are different precautions depending on the supplier. Praxair, link is supplied, Brenntag is not available online without creating a log in to access the SDS, this is the supplier we use. Making the SDS to get hard, the SDS supplied by RRWWTP was outdated, the supplier was contacted and an updated SDS was supplied. Copy emailed to RRWWTP.\n\n14. There was some hesitation to call the on-call mechanic, the staff explained the RR mechanic is on call one week then the Central Maintenance team is on call the next and it rotates like this. This is the reason why Michael Givens was called instead of the mechanic on shift, as it was not the RR mechanic due to the rotation. As Michael understands the plant better."

As this chemical is heavier than air and on a calm day it will settle and be retained by the concrete barriers in place with limited opens to allow for the gas to disburse quickly. The weather on the night of the release was wind speed 8.5 MPH and 100% humidity which would have kept the gas contained for a longer time frame inside the barriers.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response \n\nThe City of Amarillo River Road Water Reclamation Plant has prepared a written emergency response/action plan that complies with the RMP Rule, other federal standards and industry guidelines.  This plan has been communicated to the Local Emergency Planning Committee LEPC/EMA and local fire department under the coordination rules of the RMP.\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Amarillo River Road Water Reclamation Plant continuously attempts to improve the safety of our processes to protect our employees, the public and the environment. The City of Amarillo River Road Water Reclamation Plant incident investigations, employee suggestions and improvements in technology are utilized to update the safety aspects of the processes."
