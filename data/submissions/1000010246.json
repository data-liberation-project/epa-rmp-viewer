We are committed to\noperating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and\nresponsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we\ninvest to prevent accidents.  In addition to ensuring that our\nemployees have the best training in the operation of our\nprocesses, we demand that safety be the first priority in\nthe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses.\n\n     We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs\nthat help ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent\nreleases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves\nto prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2)\nroutine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure\nvessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using\nmaterials of construction that are compatible with the\nprocess chemistry, (4) vessel pressure and temperature are\ncontinuously monitored and (5) use of carbon and water\nscrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n     \n     However, should a release occur, trained personnel will\nrespond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation\nmeasures that have been included in our design include\ninstallation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems\nin areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire\nfighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented\nemergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system\nfor early notification of a release.

Raw materials are received via\nrail cars, tank trucks and in tote bins and drums.  As a\npart of the manufacturing processes, we use some substances\nthat are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule\n(40 CFR 68).  The plant also uses a combination of good\ndesign practices, an accidental release prevention program\nand an emergency response program to ensure the safety of\nour employees, the public and the environment.  We are\ncommitted to operating our facility in a safe and\nresponsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the\nfacility and the RMP regulated chemicals at the site.\n\n     The Columbus plant is situated on an 18 acre site.\nAdjacent to the plant are an 8 acre Technical Center\n(shutdown) and a 4 acre vacant lot.  The site has three covered\nchemicals.  All processes are subject to Program Level 3.\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\n     EPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that companies\nprovide information about two types of offsite consequence\nanalysis scenarios:  worst-case scenarios and alternative\nrelease scenarios.  There are strict requirements for\nchoosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a\nresult, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative\nand represent a situation that is quite unlikely to occur.\nThe purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to\nprovide emergency planners with more information about the\nchemicals we handle and their relative hazards.  The\nalternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-\ncase scenarios.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n     We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing\naccidental releases of our chemicals.

The procedures\ninclude all aspects of emergency response, including proper\nfirst-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency\nequipment, the use of personal protective equipment,\nevacuation plans and community emergency response\nnotification procedures.  Procedures for maintaining\nemergency response equipment are also contained in the\nemergency response plan.  There are procedures that address\nmaintaining, inspecting, testing and using the critical\nequipment needed in an emergency.  Employees receive\nperiodic training in the duties they are expected to perform\nduring an emergency and any change in the emergency response\nplan is administered through the management of change\nprocess so that affected employees are notified.\n\n     The emergency response plan is coordinated with local\nemergency responders (e.g., the fire department).  This\nincludes periodic meetings with community responders so that\nthey are aware of the hazards of our processes.\nCommunication channels with local responders are kept open\n24 hours per day.  This coordination and communication\nensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary,\nand that action is promptly taken to minimize the\nconsequences of a release.  We periodically conduct\nemergency response drills so that"

      "SummaryText": "all participants are\nfamiliar with their duties during an emergency.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     The Columbus plant continuously strives to improve the\nsafety of our processes.  Suggestions for improving safety\nare regularly addressed through process hazard analyses,\nmanagement of change procedures, incident investigations and\nemployee suggestions.  In addition, careful review of the\nworst case and alternate case scenarios has revealed several\nadditional mitigation/detection systems worthy of consideration\nfor future implementation.  These include:\n\n- Keeping water in the epichlorhydrin tank farm to serve as a \nvapor barrier should a leak occur\n\n- Installing an external deluge system on the epichlorohydrin\ntank for cooling during high temperature events (>37 Deg C)\n\n- Implementation of discrete temperature and pressure alarms\nfor the epichlorohydrin tank\n\n- Installation of leak detection systems for all covered-process\nbulk storage tank"
