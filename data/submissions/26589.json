      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBenton/Washington Regional Public Water Authority (formerly Benton/Washington County Water Association) is a regional water supply entity with an intake pumping station on Beaver Lake, a water treatment plant featuring coagulation, filtration, chlorination, lime for pH balance and polymer to assist the coagulant, and, a flouride feed system.  A carbon feed system at the WTP and a potassium permanaganate system at the intake exist but have not been needed through the date of this submittal.\n\nA 2MG clear well, two storage tanks (5 MG and 2 MG) and a booster pump station are connected by some 70 miles of transmission and connector pipeline. The Authority serves seven cities, two County RDAs and three special districts; each entity having a Director and Alternate on the Board of Directors.\n\nTwo of the Authority's facilities are subject to creation of a Risk Management Plan; the water treatment plant and the booster pump station.  Gaseous chlorine is stored and dispensed from each of those locations.\n\nThis plan assumes (Worst Case ID 1) that three of the 150 pound cylinders release all of its contents within 1 minute.  Public notice, evacuation of residents within the projected plume and immediate contact to the Washington County Emergency Services unit are the prescribed steps in the ER Plan.  Once the situation is under control, AR Department of Health must be officially notified. Additionally, any resulting \"out-of-service\" status for the booster pump station requires that the affected Members (four) be notified so that alternate water sources may be called upon or water conservation measures may be implemented in their respective distribution systems.\n\nGaseous chlorine is not subject to mitigation controls, and its density keeps it close to the ground, directing it to the lowest parts of the local topography.  Dispersion due to dilution in the atmosphere and oxidation by sunlight represents the only practical means of disposing of excaped chlorine g"

      "SummaryText": "as.\n\nEarly detection and timely notification of nearby residents in the projected plume path given topographic realities along with the wind direction and speed are the keys to minimizing harm to residents.\n\nDectection is by audio alarm and frequent inspection of the chlorine cylinders and the diffusing manifold system.  The on-duty Operator makes these inspections during the course of his/her shift.  Any abnormality in any part of the chlorination application process is immediately evaluated and action to correct is taken by the Operator.  If the situation can not be controlled, the provisions of the ER and this RMP are activated."
