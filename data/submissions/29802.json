      "SummaryText": "This facility complies with OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards for Anhydrous Ammonia storage.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Mercer County Law Enforcement Center's 911 system  and request  that the Hazen Fire Department and the Hazen Ambulance Service respond to our emergency.  Mercer County Disaster Emergency coordinator, Richard Sorenson, would also be notified.  This facility is a grain elevator, and we also handle anhydrous ammonia  for sale to the public.  We own, lease and operate 2 fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia plants, this  one which is located at our Hazen elevator location, another one 2 miles southwest of Hebron, and another at our Beulah location.  Our worst case scenario for Hazen plant is the pull away breaking 25 ft. section of a 4 in. hose, causing vapor release.  According to the EPA's look-up endpoint, there is a 5mile radius, with a total population of 3000, within the distance to the endpoint.  This facility complies with the EPA's accidental prevention rules and all applicable state and local code regulations.  We have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injury, property damage, or evacuations. This plant, located in Hazen, is inspected every five years by the Department of Insurance of the State of North Dakota, by the Chief Boiler Inspector, and seasonally by our plant supervisor."
