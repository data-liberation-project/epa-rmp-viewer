      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nST. JOHNS RIVER POWER PARK\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nRE-SUBMITTAL:  DECEMBER 2001\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) is co-owned by Florida Power and Light Company and the JEA.   The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plant Manager retains ultimate responsibility for these procedures, while specific duties are delegated to other employees.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe SJRPP is a two-unit power generation plant located at 11201 New Berlin Road, northeast of downtown Jacksonville, Florida, 2 miles north of the I-295 and Hecksher Drive intersection.  SJRPP adds chlorine as a biocide to the cooling tower recirculating water and will install an additional chlorination system for its' makeup water in the Spring of 2002.\n\nSJRPP stores liquefied chlorine in up to eighteen one-ton containers at the Cooling Tower Recirculating Water process and will store the same amount at its new process for Makeup Water Chlorination process.  Six containers are always connected to the process, while up to twelve additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The maximum total chlorine inventory in each of the processes is 36,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for each chlorine process located on site.  The Cooling Tower Recirculating Water process has no passive mitigation.  The new Chlorination System for the Makeup Water will be enclosed in a building that meets passive mitigation requriments and will have active mitigation in the form of a chemical scrubbing solution that will mitigate any chlorine release upon detection.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of a ton container from the Cooling Tower Recirculating"

Under worst case weather conditions, the chlorine gas could travel 3.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L) using WWTP Guidance Method.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Cooling Tower Recirculating Water Process is characterized by a break from the gas supply valve due to the valve connection failure from worker/human error, external impact, or corrosion.  For the Cooling Tower Recirculating Water Process, the release rate was determined to be 83.8 lbs/min.  Under normally expected weather conditions and no passive or active mitigation, the chlorine gas could travel 0.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L) using WWTP Guidance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Makeup Chlorination System is also characterized by a break from the gas supply valve due to the valve connection failure from worker/human error, external impact, or corrosion.  For the Makeup Chlorination Process, the mitigated release rate was determined to be 23.8 lbs/min.  Due to the unlikelihood that the chlorine scrubber would fail and taking in consideration both active mitigation and passive mitigation,  the chlorine gas could travel 0.1 miles under normally expected weather conditions before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L) using WWTP Guidance.\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nBoth (existing and newly predicted) chlorination processes at SJRPP exceed the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places both (existing and newly predicted) SJRPP chlorination processes in the Program 3 level.  The SJRPP "

SJRPP is in the process of developing a new PSM program for the newly predicted Makeup Water Chlorination Process reported in this RMP submittal.\n\nThe SJRPP has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  To ensure that all requirements of the RMP regulation were met, the original PSM Program was reviewed and updated in 2001 in conjunction with a process change.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan, which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and services.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the SJRPP Safety/Security Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff also performed a Process Hazard Analysis of the process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into th"

The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe SJRPP facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe SJRPP has an Emergency Evacuation Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal incidental emergency response capability and has a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine, entitled \"SJRPP Procedure for Chlroine Emergency Response\" (SJRPP Procedure SF-039).  The current plan has been coordinated with the Environmental Recovery Group, a private company whose service is the repair and clean-up of chemical spills.  If needed, additional assistance can be obtained from the Jacksonville Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911."
