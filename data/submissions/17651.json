The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. It is the policy of Agri-Energy, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAgri-Energy, LLC operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Luverne, in Rock County, Minnesota. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with soluables, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain 30 to 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 120,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a failure of the natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  More detailed offsite consequence (OCA) data is held confidential by the EPA.  \n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative case scenario evaluated using RMP Guidance was a failure of the largest natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  More detailed offsite consequence (OCA) data is held confidential by the EPA.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Agri-Energy, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.
