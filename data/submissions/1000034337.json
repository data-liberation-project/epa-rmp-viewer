              "Description": "This is a batch process utilizing a jacketed, stirred tank, pressurized vessel (reactor); additionally, the reactors are glass lined.  All safety devices described on the other batch reactors apply to this reaction system.\n\n\n\nSafety relief devices protect the reactors from catastrophic failure caused by over pressurization.  These reactors vent through a condenser and then one of the following to minimize harmful emissions to the atmosphere:  an acid/base absorber/scrubber system and a final activated carbon bed OR to a base scrubber and a flare.\n\nThe regulated chemicals used in the described systems are anhydrous ammonia and acetaldehyde.  \n\n\n\nThe largest quantity of ammonia onsite is contained in a horizontal 250 psig pressure rated storage tank.  The ammonia storage tank is loaded from a delivery tank truck using a closed, vapor recycle system to prevent emissions of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The ammonia tank also has an excess flow valve that will shut down the flow of ammonia in case of a line rupture or excessive flow to the reactor.  The ammonia tank is inspected for corrosion and wall thickness every three years by an outside contractor to ensure tank integrity.  Like the other processes, a maintenance plan is enforced to maintain mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nThe acetaldehyde is received in a trailer tank.  The trailer tank contains enough acetaldehyde for up to 3 reactor runs (batches) and is removed from the site upon completion of the batches required to empty the tank.  A maximum of 4 batches are made per week.  Acetaldehyde is not stored onsite.  The trailer tank is DOT rated and inspected for safe transportation and storage of acetaldehyde.  When onsite, the acetaldehyde trailer is within ten feet of the batch reactor.  Excess acetaldehyde is vented through the reactor to a flare.  The trailer tank has an excess flow valve.  \n\n\n\nBoth the trailer tank and ammonia storage tank are protected by safety relief devices to prevent rupture by over pressurization.\n\n\n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of ammonia and acetaldehyde",

The oxyalkylated products process is a batch process carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor).  The reactor is protected from a catastrophic failure caused by over pressurization by the installed safety relief devices.  The reactor pressure is also managed by the controlled addition of EO or PO and by the reactor cooling jacket.  The reactors are vented through a vent condenser to a flare to minimize emissions of EO and PO to the atmosphere.  Destruction efficiency of the flare is greater than 98 percent.\n\nThe largest quantity of EO or PO onsite is located in respective storage vessels.  These storage tanks are horizontal pressure vessels rated at 150 psig.  They are equipped with safety relief devices to prevent catastrophic release of EO or PO as a result of tank over pressurization.  The EO and PO in the tanks are blanketed with nitrogen to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the tanks.  The nitrogen pressure does not exceed 75 psig, which is well below the 150 psig pressure rating of the tanks.  No-leak design, canned pumps are used to transfer the EO or PO from the rail cars to the bulk storage tanks.  EO and PO are transferred between storage tanks and to reactors using double sealed centrifugal pumps.  The transfer lines contain check valves that inhibit reverse flow from the reactor to the storage tanks to prevent contamination and/or over pressurization of the storage tanks.  The storage tanks and piping are inspected for thickness and corrosion every three years by an outside contractor to ensure mechanical integrity.\n\nThe EO and PO storage tanks are loaded by railroad tank car.  A system is used to recycle vapors from the storage tank to the railcar while the liquid EO or PO is pumped into the storage tank.  This system prevents venting of EO or PO to the atmosphere.\n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of EO and PO and in emergency response procedures.  A written maintenance program is used to ensure inspection and timely correction of any leaks that might develop in the process.",

              "Description": "The esterification process is a batch process utilizing a jacketed, stirred tank, pressurized vessel (reactor).  All safety devices described on the other batch reactors apply to this reaction system.  Safety relief devices protect the reactors from catastrophic failure caused by over pressurization.  These reactors vent through a condenser to an acid/base absorber/scrubber system and a final activated carbon bed or the flare to minimize harmful emissions to the atmosphere.\n\nThe regulated chemicals for this process area anhydrous ammonia and acetaldehyde.  The largest quantity of ammonia onsite is contained in a horizontal 250 psig pressure rated storage tank.  The acetaldehyde is received in the trailer tank.  The trailer tank contains enough acetaldehyde for 24 batch reactor runs and is removed from the site at the completion of this approximately two and one half hour production run.  A maximum of two runs per week is made, with a maximum of 24 runs per year.  Acetaldehyde is not store onsite.  The trailer tank is DOT rated and inspected for the safe transportation and storage of acetaldehyde.\n\nBoth the trailer tank and ammonia storage tank are protected by safety relief devices to prevent rupture by over pressurization.  When onsite, the acetaldehyde trailer is within ten feet of the batch reactor.  Excess acetaldehyde is vented through the reactor to the flare via the plant scrubber system.  The trailer tank has an excess flow valve.  The ammonia storage tank is loaded from a delivery tank truck using a closed, vapor recycle system to prevent emissions of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The ammonia tank also has an excess flow valve that will shut down the flow of ammonia within one minute in case of a line leak or excessive flow to the reactor.\n\nThe ammonia tank is inspected for corrosion and wall thickness every three years by an outside contractor to ensure tank integrity.  Like the other processes, a maintenance plan is enforced to maintain mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of ammonia and acetaldhyde.  They are also required to attend monthly safety meetings.  As at all Champion Technologies' sites, the operators and supervisors are instructed in the following areas:  a) overview of RCRA rules and regulations; b) emergency response and spill prevention; c) Right-to-Know laws; d) use of safety equipment; e) job -specific training; f) chemical safety training; g) respiratory protection; and h) confined space entry procedures.  A full file of material safety data sheets (MSDS), readily available for both the employees and the public, are located at each of the Champion Technologies' sites.",

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The plant PSM program incorporates all of the PSM elements identified in the regulation. The standards and procedures developed for the PSM program are applied uniformly in the plant to both PSM covered processes and other chemical processes to ensure that the plant is operated safely. The plant operations have also incorporated the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68 accidental release prevention program into plant operational procedures and practices. \n\n\n\nThe processes at Champion have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Section 7 of the RMP describes existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility. The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at Champion. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nChampion has implemented a written emergency response plan to handle accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including bringing releases under control (when feasible), adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response. The emergency plan has be"
