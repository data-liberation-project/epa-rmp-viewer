This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Camp Frio Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nCamp Frio Facility is located as 31912 Merced Avenue, Bakersfield, California. 93308.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 16,000 pounds (lbs.).  The system is used for refrigeration for the production process.  \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Camp Frio Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility is limited to a maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia of 16,000 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 10,000-lb. threshold for the US EPA RMP and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) threshold quantities and over the 500-lb. state threshold for CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program 3.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: An alternative release scenario was modeled. \n\n\n\nRisk Considerati"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such event.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n?Well-designed Relief System and Relief Valves are tied to Diffusion Tank\n\n?Gas Detection Systems and Alarms\n\n?Safety Showers/Eyewash Stations\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of 19 CCR ?2750.9, the owner or operator shall submit the data required under ?2745.5, and ?2745.7 with respect to that accident within six months of the release or by the time the RMP is updated under ?2745.10, whichever is earlier.  19 CCR ?2750.9 states:\n\nThe owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nCamp Frio Facility has had no releases in the last five years that meets the five-year accident history reporting criteria, therefore no data is required. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCamp Frio Facility is a non-responding facility and does not train employees for active responses to ammonia releases.
