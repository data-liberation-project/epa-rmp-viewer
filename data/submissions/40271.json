The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 11 12(r)(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility?s Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental  Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rico requirements.  The wastewater treatment process at the Vega Baja Treatment Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO and EQB.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Vega Baja Wastewater Treatment Plant observes various safety precautions in the storate and use of chlorine.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Veba Baja Plant process the wastewater to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans and water bodies.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in one tons containers.  The storage building has space for up to 3 full containers, a total of 6,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine containers are connected to chlorinators, a system that regulates vacuum and chlorine flow in the system.  There is a pressure activated flow control valve attached to the container valve for automatic system shutdown.  The chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for disinfection at six disinfection points.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program is composed of thirty elements it?s objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment, and property.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response p"

      "SummaryText": "rogram.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warming of any leak.  Leak repair kits are kept on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response program is coordinated with Civil Defense for notification of the public.\n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training.  All PRASA facilities are scheduled to receive refresher training by September 30, 2004.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years, there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pound resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from at PHA are then addressed in PRASA Prevention Program.  Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent trainings in operation procedures and emergency response, and an improved maintenance program."
