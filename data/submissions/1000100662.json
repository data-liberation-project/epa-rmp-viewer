      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe City of Winona Water Treatment facility located in Winona, MN is a municipal water treatment facility. The facility has chlorine which is used for water sanitization purposes. The City of Winona has a strong commitment to operate the facility in a safe and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is contained in a closed system designed to remain inside the piping and vessels. Chlorine is injected into the municipal water supply at the facility and fully consumed once injected. \r\n\r\nChlorine is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is the City of Winona policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which chlorine is handled, use of safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, and training of facility personnel.\r\n\r\nA.\tAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe City of Winona takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of chlorine from the treatment system. These precautions include safety controls and alarms which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. The facility also has a maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel and emergency action procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets and releases.\r\n\r\nThe City of Winona Water Superintendent is responsible for the management of the chlorine safety programs.\r\n\r\nB.\tStationary Source"
