Anhydrous ammonia is used on-site in the refrigeration system.  Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n   *  Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n   *  Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n   *  Reduce the threat to the community and environment\n\n\n\nColumbia Fruit's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Columbia Fruit to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nColumbia Fruit's emergency response plan recognizes the health risks of exposure to high levels of anhydrous ammonia. Columbia Fruit has not trained its refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response.  In case of an incident involving the release of ammonia, employees are trained to move to the assembly area determined by the Evacuation Coordinator.  The Chelan County Fire District #1 will respond to the incident and take control upon arrival.  The Fire Department's Hazmat team will be responsible to enter the facility, if needed. Chelan County Fire District is located within one mile of the facility. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 21,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.  The Euclid Plant has two separate systems (Plant 1 and Plant 2).  Plant 1 has approx 6,500 lbs of ammonia and Plant 2 has approx 14,810 lbs.  The ammonia is not shared between the two plants, and buildings are around 300 feet apart.  The closed refrigeration system moves the ammonia through a series of vessels, tanks and piping.  The many safeties within "

Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Columbia Fruit utilizes include:\n\n  * Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n  * Suction trap hi-level float\n\n  * High discharge pressure shut down\n\n  * Low suction pressure shut down\n\n  * High discharge temperature shut down\n\n  * Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n  * High amperes shut down\n\n  * Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n\n  * Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n  * 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n  * 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n  * Emergency ventilation\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures have been prepared by Columbia Fruit to be used by employees"

These procedures are part of the ongoing training.  Annual Evacuation Drills are also part of this training.  Chelan County Fire Department has received a copy of Columbia Fruit's Emergency Response Plan, and have toured the facility. \n\n\n\nRefrigeration personnel have received appropriate technician level training from the Ammonia Safety Training Institute (ASTI).\n\n\n\nColumbia Fruit will continue to ensure that its employees assigned to work on the process receive current training."
