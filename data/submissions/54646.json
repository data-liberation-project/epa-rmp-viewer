This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. The following is a statement from Bear Paw Energy, LLC (BPE) Senior Management.  Bear Paw Energy, LLC believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of BPE are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal, located in Richland County, Montana, has liquid propane and liquid butane delivered via pipeline from our Grasslands Gas Plant.  The product is delivered to the four 30,000 gal storage tanks and then transferred to rail cars.  The most rail cars loaded on site would be six 30,000 gal propane and four 30,000 gal butane.  The facility is manned and operated during daylight hours only (8 to 16 hours/day), seven days per week.  The facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\nOFFSITE CO"

      "SummaryText": "NSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the terminal is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 161,509 pounds of butane from the facilities largest storage vessel.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile.  Four public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.40 mile radius.  The four public receptors were residences.  Estimated residential population within the 0.40 mile radius is 8 people.  \n\nThe most likely alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance that reached a public receptor was a failure of a propane loading hose during pumping.  Release volume was limited to 2,611 gal., since there are excess flow valves on the tank.  The ARS assumed a  11,025 lb release of propane liquid/vapor to atmosphere over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.10 mile. One public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.1 mile endpoint radius.  The sole public receptor was a residence.  Residential population within the endpoint is estimated at 2 persons.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the terminal.  Because processes at the rail terminal that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) risk management program regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) process safety management"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the rail terminal\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the rail terminal and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the rail terminal has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include terminal safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The area Safety Department in conjunction with terminal personnel are assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analysis is recognized by OSHA and the EPA as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Terminal PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are addressed locally and by the company\u00bfs corporate Safety and Engineering Departments for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps en"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\nIn addition, Riverview Rail Terminal\u00bfs Operating Procedures provide guidance on how to respond to specific process or equipment parameters that exceed the parameter upper or lower limit.  Operating Procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Riverview Rail Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the rail terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Riverview Rail Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Equipment manufacturer\u00bfs written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will cor"

The Riverview Rail Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repair.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practice\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal has long-standing, safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes."

      "SummaryText": "In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Riverview Rail Terminal periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are forwarded to the company\u00bfs Safety Department for resolution.  The  Safety Department initiates any corrective actions taken in response to the audit and tracks them until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Riverview Rail Terminal have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\t  Release Detection\n\n\t  Daily operator inspection.\n\n\t  Release Containment/Control\n\n\t  Process relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization.\n\n\t  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n\t  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n\n\t  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n\t  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., backup pumps, etc.).\n\n\t  Release Mitigation\n\n\t  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n\n\t  Trained emergency response personnel (HAZWOPER, fire response).\n\n\t  Personal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, SCBA, etc.).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal experienced NO reportable accidents in the past 5 years.  Releases that did occur at the terminal involving a regulated substance, were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibili"

The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\nIn addition, the terminal has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in plant monthly emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. \n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other BPE facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Riverview Rail Terminal is coordinated with the Richland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community\u00bfs emergency response plan.  The local responder for terminal emergencies is the Sidney Volunteer Fire Department and Richland Co. Sheriff\u00bfs Department.  The Riverview Rail Terminal through the Grasslands Gas Plant control center has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff\u00bfs office).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Riverview Rail Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.
