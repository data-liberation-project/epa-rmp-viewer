Lilly manufactures both human health products and animal health products at its Tippecanoe Laboratories facility (Tippecanoe Labs).  Tippecanoe Labs is located near Lafayette, Indiana.  Operations at Tippecanoe Labs began in 1954.  Tippecanoe Labs owns over 2000 acres, including farmland and a wildlife habitat.  The plant itself includes 128 buildings on 500 acres.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Tippecanoe Labs has designed and implemented, including:\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n4.  Five-year accident history\n5.  The emergency response program\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  Tippecanoe Labs has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Tippecanoe Labs' accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors. \n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing manufactures bulk drug substances and clinical trials materials for human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Incineration Services, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  Fermented Products Manufacturing manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks. The third functional area, Site Services, includes Utilities and maintenance areas that provide services to the entire site.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\nAs a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care?.

All Lilly sites regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (Indiana and Puerto Rico sites) participate in this national program.  Similar programs have also been initiated in European and Canadian plants. The heart of the Responsible Care ? initiative is the six Codes of Management Practices:\n\nCOMMUNITY AWARENESS & EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nGoal:  Ensure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know\n\nEMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY\nGoal:  Protect the health and safety of employees and people visiting company sites\n\nPOLLUTION PREVENTION\nGoal:  Promote efforts to protect the environment by generating less waste and reducing emissions\n\nPROCESS SAFETY\nGoal:  Prevent fires, explosions and accidental releases\n\nDISTRIBUTION\nGoal:  Reduce the risk to public carriers, customers, contractors, employees and environment posed by the transportation and storage of chemicals\n\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\nGoal:  Promote the safe handling of chemicals and products from initial manufacture to distribution, sale and ultimate disposal\n\nA ?new? Responsible Care? was rolled out by the American Chemistry Council in 2001, which responds to both public feedback about the initiative and the changing global economic and socio-political climate.  The ?new? Responsible Care? initiative has resulted in a Responsible Care? Management System (RCMS) technical specification, which all member companies must implement and then seek external certification to verify implementation.  Furthermore, an additional Code of Management Practice was added to address chemical security.  One of the numerous requirements of this code is prioritization of sites, with security vulnerability assessments conducted, identification of action plans, implementation of these plans and external verification of the plan execution.  Security vulnerability assessments were performed at the Lilly sites in 2003, with action plans targeted for completion by mid-2005;"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nTippecanoe Labs has had no accidents as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 during the past five years. \n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT TIPPECANOE LABS\nThe Tippecanoe Labs emergency response plan is linked to the plans of the Tippecanoe County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The site's response is coordinated by plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment.  The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT NETWORK (CAN) SYSTEM\nTippecanoe Laboratories has implemented an innovative community emergency notification system.  The Community Alert Network, or CAN System, is an automated phone messaging system that can place more than 1000 calls in ten minutes to neighbors announcing a site emergency.  The phone call will ask the neighbors to shelter-in-place until the emergency is over.  Tippecanoe Labs routinely tests the CAN system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS\nTippecanoe Labs maintains a fully trained emergency response organization that is on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The site has approximately 100 fully trained emergency response personnel.  Site emergency response teams undergo regular training by security coordinators and officers.  These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country.  Each response "

Tippecanoe Labs also has an on-site medical facility.\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is committed to ongoing safety improvement.  Accident prevention is incorporated into each stage of the facility's life cycle, from the up-front design and construction through start-up, operation and maintenance to any facility expansion or modification.  The multiple safeguards ensure accident prevention.  Ongoing safety improvements include safely designing, building, or modifying facilities. Employees and contractors are appropriately trained and tested.  Equipment is safely started or re-started following pre-startup safety reviews.  The plant is safely operated using detailed operating procedures that include safe operating limits.  Equipment is regularly inspected and maintained.  Process hazard reviews are completed and periodically updated.  Approximately 15,000 man-hours per year are put into process hazard reviews at Tippecanoe Labs.  The entire safety system is regularly audited."
