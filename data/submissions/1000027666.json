The risk management and process safety management programs for this refining process are applied uniformly to each production unit in the process. This approach results in one refinery-wide accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nInformation reported in the prevention program section is a summary of information from the individual production units which make up the single refinery process. The most recent date or information for any production unit has been provided for each required reporting element of the prevention program.\n\n\n\nAs an example, the refinery process hazard analysis (PHA) was originally completed on a production unit by production unit basis. It is revalidated at least every 5 years using the same approach. This method allows management to use the appropriate process hazard analysis methodology based on the complexity of the production unit being evaluated. For reporting purposes, we have included the last date that a production unit PHA revalidation was performed to complete the PHA revalidation cycle for the entire refinery process.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring systems, and detection systems are reported for the production units in the refinery process and are typical of those found in a modern oil refinery.\n\n\n\nFor other elements such as training and maintenance inspections, the last date the activity was completed for one of the production units composing the refinery process is provided. These activities are scheduled for all production units that combine to form the refinery process.\n\n\n\nAdditional information covering the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery prevention program is provided in the executive summary.",

This results in one refinery-wide accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nTwo goals for the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery include a 'Journey to Zero' incident mindset, and that we are a welcome business in the community. Preventing accidental releases is an essential component to achieve these goals. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery uses a variety of activities, as described below in the general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps section, to reduce the chances of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nAn emergency response team of volunteer employees receives annual training in emergency response techniques. This training includes fire fighting techniques. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery's goal is to be able to respond effectively to any emergencies within the refinery. The emergency response team also trains with other local emergency responders so that both groups are prepared to respond if an event exceeds the refinery's capabilities.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THIS STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nSuncor Energ"

      "SummaryText": "y Inc. is a Canadian company that specializes in mining and upgrading tar sands in the northern area of Alberta, Canada.  This submission treats the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery as a single stationary source process for the production of petroleum fuels.  The refinery produces multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, propane, butane, asphalt components, and sulfur. The refinery produces several regulated flammable substances as products. In addition, some of these materials are used in the various production units. The refinery also has some RMP listed toxic substances, with Hydrogen Sulfide being the only material to exceed threshold quantity specified in the regulation.  Practices are in place to protect employees, the community, and the environment from the flammables and the toxics.\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RMP requires the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery to report all accidents that had specific on-site, community, or environmental impacts within the past 5 years. There have been no accidents that meet the reporting requirements for this resubmittal. This has been determined based upon the results of interviews with Suncor employees and a review of safety and environmental records covering the five year period prior to the submission date of the RMP.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program elements in place at the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery and describes the systems that have been implemented to help prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nManagement Commitment\n\n\n\nSEUSA's Commerce City Refinery management recognizes the value of active, widespread employee participation in the effective application of process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention for the risk management program (RMP).\n\n\n\nEffective process safety management depends upon the knowledge and contribution of every employee involved with the operation"

Refinery employees have been and will continue to be involved with implementing process safety management and accidental release prevention.\n\n\n\nThe refinery management team members understand their role, which includes the commitment of resources to implement site PSM and RMP policies and procedures and to sustain and continually improve safety.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThere is a written employee participation plan that describes how employees participate in PSM and the RMP accidental release prevention program development and implementation. It also describes how employees have access to the information they need to do their jobs safely. Employees participate in updating and compiling procedures, conducting inspections and tests on equipment, acting as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, and play active roles in management of change, pre-start-up-safety reviews, contractor evaluations, compliance audits, incident investigations, and sequential safety meetings This intensive and wide spread involvement in by all employees is considered essential to the effectiveness and sustainability of the accident prevention efforts.\n\n \n\nThe refinery supports a Joint Health and Safety Committee and Process Safety Employee Committee to involve employees at various levels of the organization in both personnel safety and process safety issues. It includes union represented employees, refinery leadership, and other department personnel. These committees address a variety of process and personnel safety issues, and provides employee consultation on the development and implementation of all elements of PSM and the accident prevention program requirements of RMP.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nAs part of compliance with PSM and RMP, the refinery maintains current information on the chemicals, technology, and equipment.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\n\n\n\nFor the technology and equipment of the process, written information is collected and validated by a variety of employees. The technology information includes the process chemistry, intended inventories, safe upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions, and the consequences of deviation from the limits. The refinery maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, procedures, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and design codes and standards. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to help ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe process hazards analysis is a systematic approach to help ensure that hazards associated with the various production units in the process are identified, evaluated, and controlled. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery uses recognized methodologies to conduct the analysis, including the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique and a what-if/checklist methodology. Process hazard analyses have been conducted on the production units as part of the PSM program and the process hazard analysis for the refinery is updated and revalidated a"

Progress on the action plan is tracked until complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. Affected refinery employees are advised of the analyses in advance for the opportunity to provide input, and employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions are advised of the outcome.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor each production unit, the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery has implemented and maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are routinely reviewed through usage or training, and there is a separate process to review and annually certify that the procedures are current and accurate. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the control rooms and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining for Operators\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, there is a training program for all employees involved in operating a process New employees receive basic training in refinery operations, including clas"

Operators are also trained before operating a newly assigned process.\n\n\n\nAffected operators are informed of and trained on changes to the procedures as required. All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained and to help ensure they understand and follow the current procedures. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nContractors work at SEUSA's Commerce City Refinery to supplement the employee workforce. For the contractors that work near or in the process, there is a comprehensive program to evaluate the contractor's safety performance and programs prior to selecting the contractors. The refinery has a program to inform the contractors of the site-specific information, including the hazards of the process, the emergency response plan, and applicable safety procedures. This helps ensure that these contractors perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the hazards, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, and understand and follow the refinery's safety rules.

The management of change system includes written procedures that provide for the changes to be reviewed and authorized before being implemented. It includes various evaluation questions that help assess the impact of the change. The proposed change is reviewed by employees to understand the technical basis of the change and any possible impact on safety and health. Once the change is authorized, any affected process safety information (for example, chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information. or procedures) is updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary information or training on the change.\n\n \n\nIf a new process is constructed or if there is a change that requires a change in the process safety information, a review is performed prior to start-up. The purpose of this pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. There are checklists to assist the employees' verification of all aspects of readiness, including field verification of the construction and verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.
