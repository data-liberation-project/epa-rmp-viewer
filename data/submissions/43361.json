FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management, and employees of Graves County Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Should a release occur, the employees at the store are prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities to contain any releases and minimize the effect to the environment and surrounding community.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION:  Our primary business is the storage of fertilizers for blending and sale to the surrounding farm community.  We also sell seed, chemicals, and farm supplies to our farmers.\n--Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to the fields by the farmers.  Main use is for nitrogen for corn production.\n--The maximum quantity stored would be 360,000 lbs.  This would be stored in 4 -- 30,000 gal tanks each holding about 140,190 lbs.of Nh3 when full.  Total in fixed storage is 560,784 Lbs.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n   a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,190., which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.41 miles.\n   b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in the transfer hose from the semi trailer to the storage tank.   It would last 2 minutes and release approximately 11908 lbs. of gas from the hose.  The distance to the endpoint would be .6 miles.  Both of these scenarios are based on modeling from the degadis model.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Sto"

THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (either a. or b.)\n   a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n  -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n  - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   b.  The following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have occurred at the facility:\n   - May, 1999 a few tank overflow valves popped off and released a small amount of gas into the air no one had to be evacuated because of the incident and no injuries were reported\n   -05/07/99;  100 pounds;  one employee was hospitalized for burns; no property damage or offsite damage was reported; wagon transfer valve malfunctioned and released ammonia.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n-The facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).\n\nc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at our store.  Periodic evaluations are done to update and assess how our safety programs and conditions are performing.  We attend yearly safety planning and training sessions to keep up with the latest industry standards and OSHA requirements. We have no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at the present tim"
