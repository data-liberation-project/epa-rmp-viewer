We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n    * A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n    * A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n    * An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n    * A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n    * An overview of our emergency response program\n\n    * An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nEnterprise's OTI Offloading Facility provides dehydration and refrigeration to products loaded through Enterprise's Oil Tanking Terminal.  The facility is designed for both propane and butane product loading.  There are three dehydrators in the facility, two of which are online while the other is being regenerated.  Every seven hours, one newly regenerated bed starts in parallel adsorption cycle and another one goes off-line for regeneration.  There are always two dehydrators in adsorption cycle at any time.  The regenerate is condensed, coalesced and treated with potassium hydroxide before being returned to the dehydrator inlet.  The dehydrators are pre and post filtered.\n\n\n\nFor butane loading, dried products are passed through two propa"

When loading propane, this first refrigeration system is used in addition to a second refrigeration system to reach cooler temperatures.  The propane is cooled to -47?F and then pumped to the loading facilities.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are no toxic substances used, manufactured, or stored at the OTI Offloading Facility that meet the RMP threshold quantities promulgated for those substances. \n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nThe OTI Offloading Facility handles the dehydration and refrigeration of propane and butane.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nAs stated previously, no toxic substances were identified at Enterprise's Oil Tanking Facility as meeting the criteria or threshold limits of the RMP Rule.  Hence, there was no need to conduct a worst-case scenario (WCS) with respect to toxic substances. \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable materials from Enterprise's OTI Offloading Facility involves the rupture or failure of the Refr"

Although the concentration of the mixture in the Refrigerant Accumulator varies, the mixture is predominantly propane.  Therefore, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propane inside the Refrigerant Accumulator.  The tank inventory of approximately 35,800 pounds is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would be approximately 0.27 miles, which will result in off-site impacts.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 1\" diameter hole in the Refrigerant Accumulator.  The Refrigerant Accumulator contains a mixture of propane and ethane at approximately 294 psig and 115?F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propane in the Refrigerant Accumulator.  The propane would be released at a rate of 2,610 lbs/min.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would be approximately 0.08 miles, which will not result in offsite impacts.  This scenario would be mitigated by means of the emergency shutdown system and the activation of the emergency response team.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the co"

We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\n\n\nWe have an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies in the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\n\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is detected, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\n\n\nRecords are maintained for all significant accidental releases of hazardous chemicals that occur at the facility.
