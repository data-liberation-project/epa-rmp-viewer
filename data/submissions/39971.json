A Process Safety Management Plan has been instituted in compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.  In the event of a release, the response team should be able to evaluate and contain the situation.  The facility has on-site Chlorine Institute Emergency Repair Kits for the chlorine cylinders to aid the team in controlling the release. \nThe Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant follows the EPA guidelines for Risk Management and the guidelines established by OSHA for Process Safety Management.  The two codes require the facility to evaluate the on and off site risks associated with a highly hazardous chemical and ensure that proper precautions and plans are implemented to minimize the impact of such release.  The facility has completed a Process Hazard Analysis to review the causes and effects of a chemical release. \nTo aid in the prevention of a leak, Belton has established a preventative maintenance program to keep the chlorine equipment in optimum condition.  Any equipment not in proper working order is immediately evaluated for repair or replacement. \nIn addition to a preventative maintenance program, the facility has established standard operating procedures in conjunction with the Chlorine Institute and manufacturer's recommendations. Employees are required to follow the standard procedures at the plant, especially near a highly hazardous chemical area.  All employees are trained prior to exposure to equipment and provided refresher training at least every three years.  Chemical awareness is discussed both in training and during safety meetings where employees can discuss any hazards or potential hazards of the chlorine system. \nChemical specific prevention steps include the installation of the gas monitors and alarm system. Self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, goggles and aprons are available for employees for protection against a chlorine leak. Automatic and manual shutoff va"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nBelton Combined Utilities owns and operates the Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant at 1408 Cooley Bridge Rd. in Belton, South Carolina. The facility is committed to providing the employees a safe working environment. To ensure this environment, the Utilities Department has established safe working practices, standard operating procedures, and accident prevention programs. Management is dedicated to training employees on proper operating procedures, emergency response, and equipment use. To prevent accidental releases of chemicals, the Department follows all applicable sections of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program. In the event of a release, the facility has coordinated response procedures with the Belton Fire Department, Anderson County Emergency Planning Committee and HazMat team. The team is equipped with all items necessary to respond to a chlorine spill or leak. \nThe Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant treats water from the City of Belton. The chlorination and dechlorination systems, installed at the plant for disinfection purposes, are housed within the chlorine building. The chlorinators and sulfonators are located within the main control room. The plant is equipped to use one-ton cylinders under normal operation. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide ton cylinders are located in separate rooms adjacent to the control room. Gas is fed from one-ton cylinders to the chlorinator or sulfonator where it then mixes with a stream of water to form a solution. The Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant typically has up to 7 one-ton chlorine cylinders on site at a time, for a total of 14000 pounds, and up to 3 one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinders on site (6000lbs). Two cylinders of each are typically connected at a time with automatic switchover valved. \nFor the Process Hazard Analysis, two release scenarios for each gas, a worst-case release and alternate release scenario, were evaluated for impact on the plant and its surround"

      "SummaryText": "ings. The worst-case release, as defined by EPA, is the greater of the following: (1) For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or (2) For substances in pipes, the greatest amount in a pipe, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity...as a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe\u00bfis released as a gas over 10 minutes. The alternative scenario is one more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. \nWorst Case Scenarios\nThe chlorine worst-case scenario for the Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant evaluated the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine as a gas within a ten-minute time span. The release was modeled using the EPA modeling tool, RMP.Comp to determine the distance to toxic endpoint. The toxic endpoint used by the RMP.Comp program is 0.0087 mg/L (EPRG-2). This is the maximum airborne concentration of chlorine that is believed nearly all individuals can withstand for one hour without the exposure causing irreversible or other serious side effects or symptoms that might prevent an individual from taking actions to protect themselves from further exposure. For the chlorine system at the water treatment plant, the release of one ton-cylinder (2000 pounds) would travel 2.2 miles before reaching its toxic endpoint. This distance accounts for the EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest maximum daily temperature of 116\u00b0F and average humidity of 65%. Approximately 1500 people could be affected by such a release. Schools, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas would also be affected. \nThe sulfur dioxide worst-case scenario for the Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant evaluated the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine as a gas within a ten-minute time span.  The release was modeled using the EPA modeling tool,"

Approximately 1500 people could be affected by such a release. Schools, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas would also be affected. \nAlternative Scenarios\nThe model used for the alternative case scenario was EPA's RMP Guidance for WWTP Reference Tables since the processes are very similar.  The alternative release scenario involves a vapor release from a \u00bd\u00bffitting on the automatic shutoff valve.  For chlorine, this failure would cause a release rate of 37 pounds per minute according to the model. The resultant distance to toxic endpoint according to Exhibit 415 is 0.3 miles which would include approximately 10 residents.  For sulfur dioxide the release rate is lower (18lbs/min) and the toxic endpoint is reached at 0.2 miles (no residences are within this range).  The releases accounted for a wind speeds of 3.0 m/s, and Stability Class D in a rural environment. These scenarios are only guesses as to what could happen.  All releases, great or small, should be handled with public safety as priority.\nThe installation of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detectors and alarms in conjunction with the development of an emergency action plan has prepared the Leo Fisher Water Treatment Plant for a chemical release. The chlorination/dechlorination processes are designed to help prevent releases.  Vacuum is used to transfer the gases through the majority of the piping.  By using a vacuum process, piping leak releases are greatly reduced.  Shutoffs are in place and emergency repair kits and a breathing apparatus are located on site.  Operating procedures stress th"
