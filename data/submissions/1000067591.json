These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\nBob Evans Foods is a domestic producer and distributor of over 60 varieties of sausage and bacon products, frozen handheld breakfast items, and other convenience foods. The Bob Evans Sulphur Springs, TX plant site is located at 1109 Industrial Dr. E in Sulphur Springs, TX, Hopkins County.  \n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration Systems.\" Approximately 7,280 lbs. for System 1 and 38,420 lbs. for System 2 of ammonia are used as a refrigerant in the facility's two systems.  A total of 45,700 lbs. of ammonia is onsite. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers and evaporators used throughout the ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas.  Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility.  This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, p"

Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents associated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident.  If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an ammonia release, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police department will notify residents and business locations.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release in the past five years.  The facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure mitigation and control of potential incidents.\n\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during the Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity inspections to improve the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and implemented in a timely manner.\n\nThe facility is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility.
