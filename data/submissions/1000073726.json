The most recent PHA is included as Attachment #3 to the PSM & RMP SOP, Process Hazard Analysis Report.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n1. CJ Bio America shall compile written process safety information before conducting any PHA in order to enable CJ Bio America personnel to identify and understand the hazards \r\n   posed by those processes involving covered chemicals.\r\n2. CJ Bio America shall document that the equipment complies with accepted engineering practices or that if equipment is designed with obsolete codes, standards, etc. that \r\n   equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and is operating safely.\r\n3. CJ Bio America shall compile and retain written information on the equipment in the process, including:\r\n a. Materials of construction\r\n b. Piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs)\r\n c. Electrical classification\r\n d. Relief system design and design basics\r\n e. Ventilation system design\r\n f. Design codes and standards employed\r\n g. Material and energy balances if built post\r\n h. Safety systems (interlocks, detection, suppression)\r\n4. The following information, at minimum, shall be included:\r\n a. Toxicity information\r\n b. Permissible exposure levels\r\n c. Physical data\r\n d. Reactivity data\r\n e. Corrosiveness data\r\n f. Thermal and chemicaJ stability data\r\n g. Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur, SDSs may be used to comply with these requirements\r\n5. PSI shall also include:\r\n a. A block flow diagram or simplified process flow diagram\r\n b. Process chemistry\r\n c. Maximum intended inventory\r\n d. Safe upper and lower limits for items such as temperature, pressure, flows, or compositions\r\n e. An evaluation of consequences of deviation\r\n6. CJ Bio America has collected requisite information which was and will be used to perform the PHA.\r\n\r\nPre Start-Up Safety Review (PS"

      "SummaryText": "SR):\r\n1. CJ Bio America must perform a PSSR, when applicable, on covered processes.\r\n2. The PSSR must confirm prior to the addition of covered chemical(s) to a process:\r\n a. Construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications\r\n b. Safety, operation, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate\r\n c. Training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed\r\n3. This element of PSM/RMP is addressed in Attachment #4 of the internal PSM & RMP SOP, Pre-startup Safety Review.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n1. CJ Bio America must train personnel in the hazards of processes in which said personnel will be involved. Personnel receive initial training in the process and SOPs with emphases on safety, health hazards, and emergency operations prior to working in the process. Refresher training must be performed at least every three years.\r\n2. This training must be appropriately documented, including:\r\n a. Identity of the employee\r\n b. Date of training\r\n c. The training is understood by the employee\r\n d. Means used to verify understanding\r\n3. This element of PSM/RMP is addressed in the internal document HRT-SOP-002, General Training Guidelines, and internal document HRT-SOP-003, On-Boarding Process.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\n1. Planning to upgrade the approach to account for post-incident head count (2019)\r\n2. Complete a new PHA next year, which will account for the expansion project (as well as PSSR, Updated PSI, MI, etc.)\r\n3. Installing digital signage to promote communication and employee participation (in progress)\r\n4. Implement a LMS system to track training requirements (2019)\r\n5. Considering a 3rd party contractor management system (2019)"
