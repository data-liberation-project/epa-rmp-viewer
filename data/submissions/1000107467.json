If able to safely do so, in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release emergency, facility personnel will press the emergency stop (E-Stop) to activate the local alarm and initiate a process emergency shut down. Emergency shutdown will also be initiated by the control system under a number of scenarios. When the local alarm sounds, or if a fire or explosion occurs, facility personnel evacuate to a safe distance and contact local emergency responders in accordance with the facility's Emergency Action Plan. \n\n(f)\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility is new; no changes are planned to improve safety."

The resulting gas is methane, which is referred to as renewable natural gas (RNG). The treatment system involves removal of hydrogen sulfide using a biological process followed by adsorptive polishing onto solid media. Carbon dioxide and most of the water is removed from the gas using pressure swing adsorption technology. After the gas is dried, the cleaned methane / renewable natural gas is compressed and loaded onto trucks for transport to a remote station for injection into a natural gas pipeline.\n\n(c)\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility has established an accidental release prevention program, which establishes the protocols needed to safely handle and use methane.  The plan is designed to prevent and minimize the effects of an unplanned, sudden or non-sudden incidents involving methane.\n\nSpecifically this plan protects the community using a combination of operating procedures and safe work practices, equipment design, emergency operations and shut-down procedures, design, detection, and employee training and education.\n\nIn the event that the digester gas cannot be treated, there is a process upset, the gas does not meet specifications or trucks are not available to receive the cleaned gas, the gas is directed to a flare for destruction.\n\nThe facility is equipped with explosive gas detectors, hydrogen sulfide detectors and flame detectors. The process controls are programmed to initiate an emergency shutdown and sound an alarm if any of these detectors are activated. \n\nThe requirements of the accidental release prevention program will be implemented as an on-going compliance policy to ensure that methane is safely stored, handled and used by the facility.

The facility stores methane (a flammable gas) in quantities in excess of the 10,000 pound Risk Management Program threshold.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR \u00a7 68.150, the facility is required to submit a single Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes the information required by \u00a7 68.150 through 68.195.  The facility is also required to provide an executive summary in the RMP.  The following is a brief description of various elements of the facility's Risk Management Program, as required by 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155.\n\n(a)\tTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe owner recognizes that the safe handling of methane is critical to the welfare of the community.  The owner recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists methane as a regulated flammable substance pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe owner is committed to implementing the stringent safety precautions required by the regulation of methane at its facility.  These safety precautions are necessary to prevent accidental releases of methane that could threaten the health of employees, contractors, members of the community, and the environment.  To this end, the owner implements routine equipment maintenance, operational procedures, employee training, and notification and coordination with emergency responders, and is committed to compliance with all applicable regulations.\n\n(b)\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility receives biogas produced in anaerobic digesters located on an adjacent farm. The digester and associated components are under the owner"
