Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, CalOSHA PSM Program, and EPA RMP Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility also utilizes fixed ammonia leak detectors to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak, to call the fire department when the concentration has reached 25 ppm, and to shut down the system at 10,000 ppm.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over-pressurization. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study (June 8, 2016), there have been no significant relea"

The liquid settles to the bottom and the vapor rises to the top and is drawn off by Compressors C-3, C-4, and C-5. The +10\u00b0F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Package RRP-1 supplies sub-cooled liquid ammonia to the Ice Machines and receives ammonia vapor/liquid mix from the Ice Machines.  In the RRP-1, liquid settles to the bottom and vapor rises to the top and is drawn by Compressors C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6.  From the compressors, the ammonia vapor is discharged to the Evaporative Condensers, Evaporators E-1 to E-16, and Ice Machines.  The Heat Exchanger receives high stage discharge from Compressors C-1 - C-6 and discharges high pressure liquid to the High Pressure Receiver.  The ammonia leaving the Evaporative Condensers is high pressure liquid which gravity flows into the High Pressure Receiver via the Thermosyphon Receiver in order to repeat the refrigeration cycle.\r\n\r\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.   All ASME vessels and compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves which are set to actuate at 250 psig except for the pressure relief valves on the oil pots, oil separator on the compressors, and Evaporative Condensers which actuate at 300 psig.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility was constructed and began operations in 2006.  \r\n\r\nThe primary business of Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. is to produce and distribute ice.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 30,850 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and distribution of ice.  Typical operating conditions range from 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.  Similar to a household refrigerator, there are no expected leaks or releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system at Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc., which is a closed-loop system.\r\n\r\nHigh pressure liquid from the High Pressure Receiver is supplied to the Flash Economizer.  From the Flash Economizer, the ammonia is fed to the -10\u00b0F and +10\u00b0F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Packages.
