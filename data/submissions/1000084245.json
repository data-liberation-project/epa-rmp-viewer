Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Norbest Division Moroni has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Norbest Division Moroni, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Norbest Division Moroni has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name                 | Process Chemical                | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nRefrigeration Process 1        Anhydrous Ammonia                 37,000\r\nRefrigeration Process 2        Anhydrous Ammonia                  6,800 (THIS PROCESS IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RMP/PSM REGULATION)\r\n\r\n* While it is recognized that Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni's Process 2 does not meet the threshold requirement for being subject to the  Federal OSHA PSM and Federal RMP regulations.  Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni has chosen to adopt RMP/PSM policy which incorporates elements from Federal OSHA PSM and Federal RMP requirements. This decision was made willingly to enhance the quality of the facility's RMP/PSM program. No Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) has requested Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni to ad"

The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nSafety Devices\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside each refrigeration machinery room. One sensor is set at the OSHA permissible exposure limit of 50 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm/strobe and a call out. Also, the same ammonia detector is installed in each refrigerated area that provides monitoring.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nNorbest Division Moroni has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.

This has improved Norbest Division Moroni's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Norbest Division Moroni's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nNorbest Division Moroni has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Norbest Division Moroni has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Norbest Division Moroni now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Norbest Division Moroni employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Norbest Division Moroni will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 43,800 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNorbest Division Moroni has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\nNorbest Division Moroni's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR \u00a768.95\r\n- Federal Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release.
