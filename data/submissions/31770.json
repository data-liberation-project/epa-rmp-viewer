Referenced documents, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Process Safety Management Plan, and SPCC plans are maintained at the facility and are available for inspection.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe PCS Phosphate - White Springs policy is to provide a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors. This policy includes prevention of accidental releases through the use of initial design to recognized standards, preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel. A work order system is in place for employees to formally report deficiencies and track progress until completed.\n\nIt is PCS Phosphate - White Springs' policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policies, and regulations. Operations of the facility are designed so as not to adversely affect the environment of the surrounding area during normal operating periods or emergencies.\n\nThe goal of PCS Phosphate - White Springs is to prevent emergencies from ever occurring. However, should an event occur, the immediate goal is to keep the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries and not allow it to present a threat to the health and safety of the public. All procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel. Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions.\n\nIt is the emergency response policy of PCS Phosphate - White Springs to immediately notify Hamilton County authorities, the LEPC, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center of a release of anhydrous ammonia that exceeds the reportable quantity. PCS Phosphate - White Springs employees will mitigate or contain the release and assist i"

      "SummaryText": "n the provision of emergency medical treatment for any injured personnel.\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nThe White Springs facility employs about 900 people. Phosphate rock mining takes places within a project area of over 100,000 acres or about 160 square miles. The Hamilton County Mine, located just off US 41 approximately eight miles north of White Springs, produces nearly four million tons of phosphate rock each year. This rock is used at the two chemical plants to produce various phosphate products. The Swift Creek Chemical Plant is located on US 41 adjacent to the Hamilton County Mine. The Suwannee River Chemical Plant is located on County Road 137, approximately six miles north of White Springs.\n\nBoth chemical plants produce sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is produced by burning sulfur in special furnaces. The sulfur is delivered in railroad tank cars. Sulfur may also be delivered by truck. The sulfuric acid is reacted with the phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid. A byproduct of this reaction is gypsum.\n\nThe two chemical plants produce a variety of products. These include sulfuric acid, concentrated phosphoric acids, diammonium phosphate (DAP), Monocalcium Phosphate (Monocal), Dicalcium Phosphate (Dical), and Defluorinated Phosphate (DFP). DAP is used as an ingredient in fertilizer. Monocal, Dical, and DFP are used as animal feed supplements. The sulfuric acid and the phosphoric acid are used as ingredients in producing these other products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the White Springs facility by railcar. It is stored in spheres or ?bullets? (tanks). The two spheres are each capable of storing 2,300 tons of anhydrous ammonia. The two bullets are each capable of storing 170 tons of anhydrous ammonia. Safety features in the storage area include relief valves and excess flow valves on the spheres and tanks, ammonia sensors and alarms, and a shut-off valve system to stop transfers of ammonia if preset conditions are exceeded. These valves will fail"

Safety features in the railcar unloading area include:\n\nAn emergency shut-off valve system (which fails closed in case power is lost) activated by any of six switches located strategically throughout the area,\nExcess flow valves in case of line failure,\nArea ammonia sensors and alarms,\nVideo monitoring systems, and\nRailcar derailers to protect cars connected for unloading.\n\nIn addition, ammonia is used in the beneficiation process at the Swift Creek Mine mill area. There is no ammonia storage at this site. Ammonia is fed directly from a railcar to the process. Only one railcar is present in the area at any given time.\n\nBecause of its isolated location the facility has its own medical clinic, fire response team, hazardous materials response team, rescue team and medical response team.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario was developed using the HG Systems model. The alternate-case scenario was developed using the DEGADIS model. Both the HG Systems and DEGADIS models are listed in 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix B to Appendix W as an EPA Guideline Model. They will calculate a release rate given storage conditions and specific leak parameters. Both models incorporate detailed thermodynamic factors for the release.\n\nThe worst case scenario is assumed to be the release of 2000 tons of anhydrous ammonia over a ten-minute period from the storage sphere. This release is expected to impact offsite areas.\n\nThe alternate case scenario is assumed to be a release of five tons of anhydrous ammonia over a period of approximately eight minutes. This release is not expected to impact any offsite areas.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe PCS Phosphate - White Springs ammonia handling and processing area is governed by the OSHA Process Safety Management rule. Additionally, the use of Safety and Ope"

The safety and operating procedures manuals contain detailed job descriptions related to each task. The manuals are reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes. Each shipment receives a detailed pre-unloading inspection, inspection during unloading, and a post unloading inspection by the operator. Employees and contractors are trained regularly to insure proficiency in all phases of the operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia that have affected offsite receptors during the last five years.  In fact, there have been no releases of ammonia that have affected offsite receptors in the 37-year operating history of the facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nThe PCS Phosphate - White Springs facility has developed an Emergency Management Plan designed to address prevention, preparation, response and recovery from a variety of potential emergencies. This includes an accidental release of a regulated substance at the facility. The facility, its employees and business operations are susceptible to emergencies such as natural disasters, severe weather, and man-made hazards. The Emergency Management Plan, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program combine for management of potential emergency situations. The Process Safety Management program is integral to the RMP and includes, among other materials, procedures for Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Employee Involvement, and Management of Change.\n\nThis facility maintains an aggressive training program for all members of its four emergency response teams (medical, hazardous materials, rescue and fire), its emergency management group, and general employees.

All positions in each response team have at least two alternates and all members of the Emergency Management Group have designated and trained alternates.\n\nBecause of the isolated nature of the location, PCS Phosphate - White Springs facility coordinates training programs with the local fire and rescue teams. This training includes joint exercises on an annual basis.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA Safety Plan is developed each year by the Safety Manager and staff, and followed to completion. Additional improvements will include the implementation of the Action Items identified by the 2004 Process Hazard Analysis. A joint project between PCS Phosphate, Hamilton County and Alltel has installed a telephone ring-down system designed for notifications in the event of an emergency anywhere in the county.\n\nG:\\RMP/cbp/1002"
