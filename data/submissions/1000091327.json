This commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  It is our policy to implement reasonable controls that provide for a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant is located about 40 miles south of Vernal, UT, on Fiddlar Rd. The area surrounding the plant is a rocky desert with limited grazing.  The majority of this land is owned by the US Government and administrated by the BLM. The facility includes compression, dehydration, a natural gas liquid recovery system using propane refrigeration and cryogenic expander plants.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) consisting of a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes, and a C6+ mixture referred to as stabilized gasoline.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The principal purpose of the plant is to remove water and heavier hydrocarbons from the produced natural gas, thus lowering the hydrocarbon dew point and BTU value of the sales gas to meet pipeline specifications.  The LPG liquids are either trucked out or shipped out via pipeline as market conditions and pipeline capacity allows.  The stabilized gasoline is trucked out.  Storage of the LPG liquids consists of three 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks. The total storage capacity of the pressurized storage tanks exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold, for fl"

WES has a comprehensive program that requires investigation into all significant incidents that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release.  There have been no such releases at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n \n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nIf necessary, the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergencies.  \n\n\n\n"
