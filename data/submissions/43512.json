This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  The Entergy Louisiana, Inc. (ELI) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nELI operates the Perryville Electric Generating Plant located in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana. The Perryville Electric Generating Plant is a gas fired steam electric plant that produces approximately 725 megawatts of electricity.  The heat recovery steam generators used to turn electric generating units produce electricity for sale to homes and businesses.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria in the Accident Release Program (ARP), the Perryville Electric Generating Plant is a Program 3 process.\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were or would be present in the planned process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  There is one ammonia tank at the facility.  The identification of a vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nELI identified one regulated toxic substance and no flammable substances above the threshold values at Perryville Electric Generating Plant.  The anhydrous ammonia tank with a capacity of 5,000 gallons was determined to exceed the threshold quantity.

This participation begins with well established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained by the company.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as, key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).

This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as, for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant uses a combination of what if checklists and a hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  These methods use a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while recommendations for improvement are proposed.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Perryville Electric Generating Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the PPS has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operations demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.
