This system has been in use since the facility began operation in December 1995.  During this time we have worked hard to develop our Process Safety Management and other safety programs so that we insure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAs part of these programs, we have designed our facility to minimize potential problems with our refrigeration system and to help mitigate any problems that might occur.  We have located our equipment in areas that are isolated from accidental contact and have trained our employees to be aware of the refrigeration equipment throughout the plant and cognizant of associated safety issues.  \n\nAmmonia, which is a standard in the commercial refrigeration industry, provides an energy efficient source of cooling for our facility and is far gentler to the environment than ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (i.e. Freon) that are used in other refrigeration applications.  In accordance with the RMP rule, two offsite consequence analyses have been performed.  The results of these analyses can be found in the body of the report.  \n\nAs an additional level of safety, we have a plant-wide early-warning detection system and have installed automatic shutdowns to help us react to and minimize any potential problems.  We also have an annunciator system to alert us to potential problems, and aid us in a rapid evacuation of plant personnel.  \n\nAs one of our proactive measures, our staff has coordinated with the Village's Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team, to inform and protect our workforce as well as our neighbors.  Training and coordination between our operators and maintenance people and the Fire Department continues to take place to maintain the highest level of community safety.  \n\nWe have had one a"

All recommendations resulting from the investigation have been followed to insure that this will not happen again.\n\nWe are continuously analyzing and improving our system, policies, and procedures by means of detailed internal audits.
