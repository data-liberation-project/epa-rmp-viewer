      "SummaryText": "Schwan's has historically placed a high priority on chemical\nsafety. The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders \ntrained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.\n\nThe Santa Ana, CA (Dyer Road) facility manufactures frozen pizza. \nAnhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this \nfacility. Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally \ncompatible refrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high \nconcentration and is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative \nmetabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dread diseases \nand does not cause lasting environmental damage. The refrigeration \nsystem at this facility contains about 11,900 pounds of ammonia.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of urban. Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \nfailure.\n\nIt is the professional judgement of Schwan\u0012s Environmental Health \nand Safety Department that a release rate of 400 lb./min. should \nbe used as an alternate case scenario in lieu of the 100 lb./min. \nrate suggested in the Model RMP.\n\nThe urban site condition will be used.\n\nB"

      "SummaryText": "ased on the above, the worst-case ammonia release scenario for \nthe Santa Ana, CA (Dyer Road) facility will be 6,500 pounds \nreleased over a 10-minute period. The alternate case will be a \nrelease rate of 400 pounds per minute. Both scenarios have off-\nsite impacts.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAlthough the Santa Ana, CA (Dyer Road) facility has experienced \none release which was reported under EPCRA Section 304 in the five \nyears beginning 21 June 1994, it was less than 500 pounds and did \nnot result in onsite or offsite casualties or off-site \nevacuations.\n\nThe Santa Ana, CA (Dyer Road) facility maintains a 3-shift \nemergency response team, trained at the 24-hour technician level. \nThe team numbers 16 members. The training is conducted by the \nCorporate Environmental Compliance Manager. The training is \ndesigned with a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical \nisolation, personal protective equipment up to use of Level `A' \nsuits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS). \nCopies of emergency plans are filed with the Fire Department and \nannual facility walkthroughs are conducted with Fire Officers. \nPreplanned command posts and staging areas have been designated \nand Incident Command transfer and liaison functions have been \nestablished. A post-incident debriefing is conducted after each \nincident.\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in \nthe Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are \nimplemented as a result of employee-based Total Quality Management \n(TQM) teams, a designated PSM team and as a result of system \nengineering modifications and extensions. Post incident \ndebriefings and incident investigations are used to identify \nadditional improvements to system safety."
