      "SummaryText": "The facility is subject to the EPA's SPCC regulation (40 CFR 112.7) and the release prevention procedures are\ndiscussed in more detail in the facility SPCC plan.  The emergency response procedures are contained at the\nfront of the RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of \nsuch a release.\nThis facility is an oil and gas production site.  NGL liquids are stripped out and stored in one or more 30,000 \ngallon pressurized bullet tank(s).  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfer to tank trucks. Separated\ncondensate is stored in a 400 barrel atmospheric storage tank and removed from the site by transfer to tank\ntruck.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing\nNGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The NGL and oil products are a mixture\nof hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane. For\npurposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL\nand pentane for condensate).\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The facility has not \nexperienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response\nprocedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the RMP and these procedures will be\nimplemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
