Co. facility is the manufacture of welding power sources and associated\n     equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the air conditioning system that serves this facility.  The total amount of \n     anhydrous ammonia that may be stored on-site is 16,000 pounds.  The largest single component in the system may\n     contain 11,000 pounds.\n\n3.

The high\n                                       pressure receiver will never be filled to more than 80% of its capacity.

This scenario is representative of several scenarios, which may include a pump seal leak,\n                                      valve packing failure, or gasket rupture.\n                                      The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.
