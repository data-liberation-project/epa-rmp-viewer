Co. facility is the manufacture of welding power sources and associated\n     equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the air conditioning system that serves this facility.  The total amount of \n     anhydrous ammonia that may be stored on-site is 16,000 pounds.  The largest single component in the system may\n     contain 11,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario are as follows:\n     Worst Case Scenario - Failure of the high pressure receiver system would release 11,000 pounds of ammonia.  The high\n                                       pressure receiver will never be filled to more than 80% of its capacity.  It is assumed that the entire\n                                       contents are released over a period of ten minutes.\n                                       The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n      Alternative Scenario -  A release of ammonia through an orifice of 1/4\" effective diameter at high pressure receiver conditions\n                                      of 180 psig.  This scenario is representative of several scenarios, which may include a pump seal leak,\n                                      valve packing failure, or gasket rupture.\n                                      The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.
