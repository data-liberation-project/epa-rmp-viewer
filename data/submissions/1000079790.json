Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\n  The management and employees of Conserv FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of\r\n  any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\r\n  the facility is prepared to work with the Winnebago County Fire Protection District,\r\n  Winnebago County Local Emergency Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release \r\n  and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\n  The primary activity at the facility, is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \r\n  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop \r\n  production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of one storage tank, \r\n  nurse tanks, loading risers and associated plumbing.  Access to the site is \r\n  restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \r\n  contractors.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case and alternate release scenario.\r\n\r\n  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternate-case scenario, however, since this is\r\n  security sensitive information it has been withheld from the Executive Summary as required by\r\n  EPA regulations.  \r\n\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \r\n  state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed \r\n  Gas Association's(CGA's)\"American National Standard Safety Requirements for The Storage and\r\n  Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"(6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\",\r\n  as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and \r\n  Health Administration(osha), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \r\n  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up"
