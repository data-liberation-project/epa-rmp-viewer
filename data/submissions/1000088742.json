      "SummaryText": " RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION:  Woodland Wholesale ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees. The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on August 14, 2019.\n\n\n\nHAZARD REVIEW:  A hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes. The most recent update of the hazard review for the anhydrous ammonia process and aqua ammonia process was conducted on June 23, 2020. Results indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review updates.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures were last revised on August 14, 2019. Operating procedures for the Anhydrous Ammonia Process are certified annually, with the last annual certification on August 14, 2019. \n\n\n\nTRAINING:  The Woodland Facility staff, as well as Grow West corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program was last reviewed on August 14, 2019. The current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n  1.  Initial employee training.\n\n  2.  Periodic refresher training.\n\n  3.  Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification.\n\n  4.  Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training.\n\n  5.  Training records for each employee.\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an "

The latest equipment inspections were conducted on February 20, 2020 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on July 30, 2019.\n\n\n\nRMP MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility RMP Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures. The MOC procedures were last modified on July 14, 2020.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW:  The pre-startup safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. The PSSR procedures were last modified on July 14, 2020.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on May 23, 2019.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place. The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in "
