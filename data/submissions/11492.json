The facility is located in the heart of the Gulf Coast petrochemical complex in East Harris County Texas.  The nearest residential neighborhood is over two miles away.  The company has an excellent record for regulatory compliance and well should, since protection of the health and safety of our employees and residents of our community is of the highest priority.  While we cannot eliminate risk completely, we can and do make a concerted effort to safeguard people and protect the environment.  We work closely with other members of our industry, the public, and local officials to maintain strong safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks.\n\nAs part of our commitment to comply with laws and regulations of local, state, and federal agencies, we are submitting the risk management plan under guidelines established by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nPrevention Program\nGNI Chemicals Corporation, Inc. has developed wide-ranging procedures and systems to reduce the likelihood of accidents, including:\n\n7 Prevention programs, which include ongoing review of safety measures.\n7 Written operating procedures that address safety issues.\n7 Training programs for employees and contractors.\n7 Existing procedures to investigate incidents and to identify their causes for improvement.\n7 Restricted access to processes and hazardous materials.\n7 Equipment that meets or surpasses industry standards.\n7 Safety inspections and audits covering employee and contractor activities.\n7 Environmental audits and inspections.\n7 Various prevention systems, such as fire and chemical extinguishing systems and dikes around tanks.\n\nIn addition to these measures, GNI Chemicals Corporation, Inc. has systems designed to address the safe handling of all chemicals that are stored "

The chemical industry has worked extensively with federal regulators for many years to develop ways to safeguard employees, the public and the environment.  Clearly, no manufacturing process is completely risk-free.  For that matter, no aspect of ordinary life is without some risk.  But with continuing attention to safety, regular monitoring of processes, and adherence to rigorous guidelines, we can reduce the likelihood of accidents.  The RMP builds upon existing safety and environmental protections and will result in more information being made to the public."
