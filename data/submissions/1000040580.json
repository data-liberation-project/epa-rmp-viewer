The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  Equipment included under this covered process includes (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank, (1) 18,000-gallong stationary storage tank, and ancillary pump, piping, and valves, (42) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (1) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks, and (6) 2,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Pennville, IN Facility located one mile north of Pennville, IN at an intersection along Highway 1 and West 500 N in Pennville, IN.  The physical address to the Facility is 8774 West 500 N, Pennville, IN 47369.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Pennville, IN Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Pennville, IN Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a correction to show an increase in the quantity of nurse tanks that the Facility added to its inventory.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Pennville, IN Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferred to one (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank and one (1) 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank.

This Facility owns and operates (37) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (1) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks, and (12) 2,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30-second release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow valves and emergency shutoff valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.
