Simplot Aberdeen Plant's Safety and Release Prevention\nProgram is composed of the following elements, which are all part of the\nintegrated safety management system. 1) Employees participate in the\nelements of this safety and release prevention program wherever\npossible; 2) Training is provided for operators and maintenance\npersonnel; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on ammonia\nhazards and the refrigeration system; 4) A Process Hazard Analysis\n(PHA) of the refrigeration system was conducted and is periodically\nreviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity\nprogram ensures the system continues to operate as designed; 6)\nOperating and Maintenance procedures provide operators and\nmaintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and\nmaintain the system; 7) Contractors working on or near the refrigeration\nsystem are selected for safety performance, and are briefed on the\nhazards and safety requirements of the job; 8) Hot Work Permits are\nrequired whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other activities are\nconducted that could generate sparks and start a fire; 9) The\nManagement of Change (MOC) program requires that the impact of\nchanges to the refrigeration system be evaluated and approved prior to\nthe work being conducted; 10) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are\nconducted prior to restart of the system after modifications to ensure that\nimpacts of the change are addressed; 11) Incident investigations are\nconducted for incidents involving ammonia releases and near misses that endanger employees or the public; 12) Compliance Audits are conducted\nevery three years to ensure that the prevention program is meeting its\nobjectives; 13) Emergency Planning and Response ensures that\nemployees and emergency personnel are prepared to respond to an\nammonia release in accordance with the plant's emergency plan and that\nnotifications are made to designated points of contact at local, state, and\nfederal levels depending on the extent of the release.",

Simplot Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  J.R. Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Unit Director has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  J.R. Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\nThe Boiler and Refrigeration Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nJ.R. Simplot Company Aberdeen Potato Plant produces frozen potato products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 50,000 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Aberdeen Plant.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regul"

      "SummaryText": "ation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\nOne ammonia-related incident occurred at the Aberdeen plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site consequences.  The incident was caused by an overpressure and subsequent breech of the thermosyphon pressure relief valve, resulting in 20 pounds of ammonia being released into the atmosphere.  No off-consequences resulted from release but two employees were exposed to the release and requested medical attention.  \n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\nAn emergency response plan has been implemented at the Aberdeen Plant.  This response plant contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\no Fire Plan\no Ammonia Leak Procedures\no Evacuation Procedures\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Aberdeen plant is currently updating the operating procedures covering the ammonia refrigeration system.  Operators will be training as the procedures are updated.  The updates to all operating procedures and training are anticipated to be completed before the end of the calendar year.\n"
