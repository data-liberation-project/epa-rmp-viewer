Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Northeast Missouri Cooperative; Novelty, MO (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of \n anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and propane are stored at the facility in ( 4 )storage tanks 30,000 and 18,000 gallons capacity for anhydrous ammonia and 2 @ 11,000 gallons capacity for propane.  The maximum quantity stored would be 204,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and 69,910 pounds of propane.\n\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.  \n        \n        The worst-case scenario for the release of propane is the total contents of the             largest storage tank that would explode and create a pressure wave of 1.0 pounds             per square inch (psi). The distance to that point is 0.3 miles.\n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release fro"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n\n        The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most         likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The                 distance to the endpoint (1.0 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles or 175 feet.        \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58. The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane for implementation at this time.
