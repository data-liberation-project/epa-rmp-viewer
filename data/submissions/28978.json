We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and communities in which we do business.  In striving for responsible environmental, health & safety (EH&S) stewardship, AEP pledges to:\n*  Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety.\n*  Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances and statues as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n*  Continually measure, evaluate and improve our EH&S performance.\n*  Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Plaquemine Cogeneration Facility (PCF), located in Plaquemine, LA is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in a dedicated, specially designed storage tank.  The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  Additionally, the facility uses chlorine in its water treatment facility.  Chlorine is stored in up to three pressurized cylinders, one of which is connected for use at any one time.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\nAs required by the RMP rule, one worst-case release scenario (WCRS) must be reported for the site.  Both ammonia and chlorine were considered.  Ammonia was chosen to report in the RM Plan, since the consequence distance was the greatest.  The ammonia tank has a total volume of 12,000 gallons, which is limited to 85% by administrative and level con"

Based on modeling results using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.07), the WCRS was calculated as the very unlikely catastrophic failure of the anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing 10,200 gallons.  Based on the analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario.  It was analyzed as the failure of a 2-inch unloading pipe from the delivery truck unloading point to the storage tank.  The release would be mitigated via excess flow valves on the storage tank and delivery truck, cable operated shutoff valves, and by automatic shutoff valves on the ammonia loading header.  The EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.07) was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, public receptors would be affected by the alternative release scenario.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nPCF is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at PCF includes:\n\nEmployee Participation\nAll PCF employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nPCF maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI data is updated when changes in the process occur.  In"

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nPCF maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, and normal operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually.  Safe work practices such as hot work, lockout, and line breaking, are referenced in operating procedures, where applicable.\n\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of PCF are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia and chlorine processes, as well as procedures to safely operate the processes.  Operations personnel receive refresher training at least every three years.\n\nContractors\nThe PCF uses contract"

Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia or chlorine process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work.  The PCF also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe PCF conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPCF has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief  systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia and chlorine processes and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.  \n\nHot Work Permits\nPCF has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nPCF has a system in place to ensure safety concerns associated with changes to the ammonia and chlorine processes are reviewed and addressed prior to the change.  Changes meeting PSM/RMP criteria are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, as well as to verify that existing safeguards and controls have not been compromised by the change.  The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPCF will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of ammonia or chlorine.  The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors).\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, PCF will conduct a compliance audit every three years.  The facility will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\nAdditional Safety Systems\nPCF has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia or chlorine, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.
