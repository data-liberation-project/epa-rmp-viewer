The anhydrous ammonia tanks are located at the rear of the property where they are unlikely to be struck by vehicles. \n\n\n\nActive prevention measures include inspection of all tanks at the beginning and end of each season.  All required repairs are performed at that time, prior to further use. Further inspection are performed semi annually by the Missouri Dept of Agriculture, Weights and Measures.\n\n\n\nEmergency response policies are as described below:\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe facility is located on the Southwest edge of Sedalia, Mo and supplies fertilizer to farmers.The facility has 2 tanks with capabilities of 26,000 and 11,000 gallons respectively, we also store nurse tanks at this location.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the ammonia operation envisions a catastrophic failure of the storage tank possibly preceded by failure of the safety relief valves.  Regulatory and procedural controls limit the amount of anhydrous in the tank to 85% of tank capacity.  Using RMP*COMP, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be at 3.6 miles.  This would include virtually the entire city of Sedalia.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenario involve a broken hose allowing product to escape.  The toxic endpoint for such a release is 0.5 miles.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with 29CFR 1910.111 (anhydrous ammonia)\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving release of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility is located within the city limits of Sedalia, Missouri.  Employees will notify the fire department in the event of a major release.  The general Manager and other designated employees are authorized to take appropriate actions to st"
