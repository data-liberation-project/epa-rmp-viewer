Badger Midstream Services, LLC will submit the Executive Summary to a central point as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n \n5.1 \tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a)) \n\nThe accidental release prevention release policy employed by Badger Midstream Services, LLC involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  This approach includes training programs for personnel; programs to guarantee safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Badger Wash Gas Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Badger Wash Gas Plant.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are typically followed.  The emergency response policy of Badger Midstream Services, LLC involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and comply with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The goal of the spill policy of Badger Midstream Services, LLC is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and that will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\n5.2  \tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b)) \n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the removal of liquid hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide from a natural gas stream.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on s"

The flammable regulated chemicals are present in the NGL produced and stored at the Facility.  The NGL is commonly known as \u00bfcondensate\u00bf, an aliphatic hydrocarbon mixture containing several flammable substances.  There are no regulated toxic substances stored or handled at the Facility.  The regulated flammable chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The Facility handles and stores the flammable substances listed above in sufficient quantities to exceed this threshold quantity.  The Facility stores up to a maximum of 27,120 gallons of condensate in above ground storage tanks and vessels.  The largest storage vessel contains a maximum of approximately 132,750 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals. \n\n \n5.3  \tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155\u00a9) \n\nBadger Midstream Services, LLC has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.180.  This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source. \n\n5.3.1  \tProcess Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis \n\nBadger Midstream Services, LLC maintains a written Emergency Response Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the Facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained in the RMP at the Facility. \n\n5.4  \tFive-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(d)) \n\nNo release of a regulated substance occurred at the Badger Wash Gas Plant in the past five years.

      "SummaryText": "o offsite release of a regulated substance has occurred at the Facility since the implementation of the Risk Management Program. \n\n5.5  \tEmergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.155(e)) \n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Program outlined in the Badger Wash Gas Plant Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment.  The Emergency Response Plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance. In the event of a NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure, as well as procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the appropriate local authorities.  A site map is included in the Emergency Response Plan.  This Emergency Response Plan is kept at the Facility separately and should be referenced in the event of a release.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes at the Facility and the covered process and the employees are informed of changes. \n\n \n5.6  \tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\nBadger Midstream Services, LLC is committed to operating the Badger Wash Gas Plant in a safe manner with regards to personnel, the public, and the environment.
