Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\n     The management and employees of Prairieland FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Scotland County Fire Protection District, the Scotland County Local Emergency Planning Committee, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the environment.\r\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\n     The primary activity at the facility, which is located at the junction of US HWY 136 and County Road U, is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\r\n4. The accidental release program.\r\n      This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\r\ncodes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage  and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K-61-1 published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA),29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.
