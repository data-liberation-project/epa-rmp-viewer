      "SummaryText": "Guardian Lima, LLC (Lima) is an ethanol fuel production plant located in Lima, Ohio in Allen County. The facility was oroginally known as Greater Ohio Ethanol. Lima has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Greater Ohio Ethanol began operations in 2009 but was shut down soon after. Guardian Lima began operations in May 2011.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nLima is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Lima uses aqueous ammonia for pH control directly in the process. In the event of a significant emergency, including an accidental release of flammable materials, it is the policy of Lima to notify appropriate authorities and evacuate all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nLima's production process uses aqueous ammonia for pH control.  The solution contains up to 30% ammonia and stored in an aboveground tank in the liquid phase.  The tank is located outdoors in a diked area and may contain up to 32,916 gallons (250,000 pounds).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, Lima has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. A PHA for a variety of hazardous processes at the facility was conducted in April 2011. Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Prog"

These efforts have been coordinated with state and federal regulating agencies and local responders. Lima also participates in the SING Group to ensure adequate fire suppression equipment are available in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAs previously mentioned, Lima is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Lima management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. Lima will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner."
