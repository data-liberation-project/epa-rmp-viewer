Metson Station is a Liquefied Petroleum Gasoline (LPG)/crude oil blending and transfer facility.  The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This is a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility currently implementing the prevention program described below.\n\nPMT has a commitment to employee and public safety.  The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes.  PMT?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe prevention program is based on 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735.  The program includes the following areas: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.Training includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, emergency response, hot work permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis.\n\nThe facility stores and unloads natural gasoline.  There are 2 tanks with a capacity of 75,600 gallons."

Metson Station has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department ? Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68,10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Kern County Environmental Health Department ? Certified Unified Program Agency.\nA preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted to fulfill the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, 19 CCR 2745.7 (q)(2).\n\nThe preliminary seismic walkthrough consisted of a visual inspection of the process area piping and vessels above grade.  Structural integrity below grade was not inspected.  Walkthrough considerations included the mechanical integrity of pipe, pipe supports, vessels and vessel supports, welds, flanges, valves, pressure safety valves, signs of surface corrosion, pipe stress points, foundation, drainage direction, fire control and interaction with other elements.\n\nThe references used for this walkthrough were the following:\n\nAPI Standard 570 Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: Maintenance Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration,\n\nProcesses Unlimited International, Inc., Engineered Safety Section, CalARP Seismic Assessment Procedure, April 12, 1999,\n\nUniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, International Conference of Building Officials.\n\nBased on the document Maps of Known"
