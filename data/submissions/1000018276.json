The Plant Engineer for the BC Systems King City site ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has established emergency procedures. The BC Systems King City emergency personnel will coordinate with the local Fire Department to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, which include response to emergencies related to the ammonia refrigeration system covered by this RMP/PSM Program. The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe BC Systems facility covered by this RMP is to be located at 600 Airport Road in King City, California. The facility receives produce to be processed and packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes. The produce is kept for short-term storage, transported and distributed from the site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is estimated at 8,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Since the amount of ammonia in the system is equal to the RMP and PSM Program threshold quantity of 8,400 pounds, the process that uses the ammonia is covered by the RMP/PSM Program requirements.\nPortable Sources and Regulated Substance\nThere are 3 portable units stationed at this facility identified as RC3, RC4 & RC9 covered by this RMP located at 600 Airport Road in King City, California. The facility receives produce to be processed and packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes. The produce is kept for short-term storage, transported and distributed from the site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. Thr"

Since the amount of ammonia in each portable unit is equal to the RMP and PSM Program threshold quantity of 8,900 pounds, the process that uses the ammonia is covered by the RMP/PSM Program requirements.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at BC Systems is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications prior to their occurrence, and the regular operation, maintenance and monitoring of the system. This includes:\nA?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction of the system, as well as in the event of system modifications through a management of change process.\nA?    Performance of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) at least once every five years using accurate process safety information.\nA?    Implementation of operating, maintenance and monitoring procedures. \nA?    Training of system operations and maintenance personnel, as well as ongoing training of the on-site Chemical Response Team. \nA?    Performances of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to hot work permit program requirements to ensure mechanical integrity.\nA?    Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols.\nA?    Use of qualified contractors for work on the system.\nThe detailed Prevention Program for this system is contained in a supporting document, which is to be maintained at by the site by the Plant Engineer.\nFive Year Accident History\nThis is a new installation of an ammonia refrigeration system. Therefore, no ammonia releases resulting in on-site or off-site injuries, "
