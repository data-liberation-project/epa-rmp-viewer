      "SummaryText": "a.  Davis Supply is a supplier of water treatment chemicals for small, local, public and private water treatment facilities.  The facility is located at 2545 Palm Avenue in Ft Myers, Florida (Maiing address P.O. Box 60095, Ft. Myers, FL 33906-6095).  A site location map is included as Figure 1 at the end of the executive summary.  This office/warehouse facility includes a chlorine storage area within the warehouse area, which contains 150-pound cylinders of chlorine secured to the west wall of the warehouse adjacent to the south side of the north loading dock door.  Empty cylinders are stored adjacent to the full cylinders in the same area.  A maximum inventory level of 25 cylinders or 3,750 pounds of chlorine gas will be stored on site at any time.  A site drawing is included at the end of the executive summary as Figure 2.  Based on the maximum chemical inventory levels at the facility, only chlorine will be subject to the RMP standard.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release.  This facility does not fall into any of the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes as listed in the RMP standard.  As a primarily retail business (i.e. selling to end users) with less than 10 full time employees on site, this facility does not meet the requirements for regulation under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.   This facility therefore qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.  \n\nb.  It is anticipated that no more than six (6) people will be employed by the facility.  In addition to 2 drivers, there will one (3) office support staff and (1) owner/manager.  The facility is generally staffed by 3-4 persons during the normal business hours of 0800 hours to 1700 hours, Monday through Friday.  \n\nc.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as A?worst-case releaseA? and A?alternative releas"

      "SummaryText": "e.A?  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, A?the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes,A? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarioA?.\n\n(1.)   The worst-case release scenario at this Davis Supply facility involves the release of the contents of a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes.  An offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed based on calculations provided by the EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (January 27, 1999) document.  This scenario followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. These conditions were set by the EPA to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; and the assumptions do not likely reflect realistic results.  The toxic endpoint based on EPA assumptions was estimated to be to be 0.4 miles.  The residential population within the entire 0.5 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.4 miles for this scenario was estimated to be 856 people.  Figure 3, presented at the end of Section 4 of this plan, depicts the worst-case scenario 0.4-mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the East to depict the prevailing wind the majority of the year and, therefore, most likely impact direction.  Public receptors within the area contained in a circle with its center at the Davis Supply facility and outwards to a radius of 0.4 miles were noted as follows:\n\nPublic Receptors*\n   1 A?

The alternative release scenario involves valve failure on a single 150-pound cylinder.  From the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release, the release rate for the valve of a 1-ton container of chlorine is 12.7 pounds per minute.  The only difference between the valve of a 1-ton container and 150-pound cylinder is the location of the fusible plug.  The release rates therefore would be expected to be the same.  Based on the calculations as provided by the EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (January 27, 1999) document the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated to be 0.1 miles.  Figure 4, presented at the end of Section 4 of this plan, depicts the alternative release scenario 0.1-mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the North to depict the most likely impact direction.  The residential population within the entire 0.03 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.1 miles for this scenario was estimated to be 0 people.
