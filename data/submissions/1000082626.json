This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Washakie Midstream Gas Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refreshers courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Washakie Midstream Gas Plant is one of many facilities operated by Mid-Con Energy Operating, LLC.  The plant is a natural gas liquid extraction facility with NGL storage and pipeline sales.  The storage at the facility consists of two 30,000 gallon tanks - one is a propane tank and other is a butanes+ tank.  The facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned stages to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nAs specified by The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenar"

In the case of the Washakie Midstream Gas Plant, this would involve a 30,000-gallon butanes+ tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,100 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  There are residences or other public receptors within the worse-case distance of 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nACCDIENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention and response policies for the Washakie Midstream Gas Plant are maintained in the facility's Emergency Response Plan and RMP Manual.  Mid-Con Energy Operating, LLC is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors.  The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Washakie Midstream Gas Plant is located near Worland, Wyoming.  It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (id: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane).  The only area in the plant than contains an above threshold quality of the regulated substances is the Product Storage Tank area.  While there is some H2S at the facility, it does not exceed the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL R"

      "SummaryText": "ELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Washakie Midstream Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program.  The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and maintenance requirements.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Washakie Midstream Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Washakie Midstream Gas Plant has developed and maintained a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release or a hazardous substance.   The EPR includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance.  Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses.  Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMid-Con Energy Operating, LLC believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.  Mid-Con Energy Operating, LLC continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Mid-Con Energy Operating, LLC also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.
