The Sagebrush Gas\r\nConditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP),\r\nwhich contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\r\n\r\nThe Sagebrush Gas Conditioning Plant's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions\r\nby plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All\r\nemployees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Sagebrush Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, and other natural gas\r\nliquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The methane is delivered by pipeline. The NGLs are\r\ndelivered by both pipelines and to a truck loading rack.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe Sagebrush Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management\r\nPlan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also\r\nimplanted all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional\r\nenvironmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure\r\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage these"

Because some contractors work on or near process\r\nequipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe\r\nmanner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an\r\nemergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they\r\nfind during their work.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures,\r\npersonnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: The Sagebrush Gas Conditioning Plant has well established practices and procedures to\r\nmaintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and\r\nemergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant\r\nentry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy\r\nsources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for\r\ngenerating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry\r\npermits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit\r\nrequired confined space.\r\n\r\nTraining: The plant h"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response,\r\nincluding evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency\r\nresponse agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually\r\nto perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made\r\nto the gas plant processes.
