This will be accomplished at all facilities by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough Process Safety Management program and complete safety training. \nThe Process Safety Management program will be managed by a Corporate team, but completed on a facility basis under the specific direction of the facility manager. The program will conform to OSHA'\u00bf regulations contained in 29 CFR Part 1910.\nSinclair Oil Corporation has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program. Sinclair Oil Corporation will update the Safety Management Program every five years. Emphasis is placed on managing the higher risk areas of our facilities first, the priority of which will be established by each facility team.\nStatement of Sinclair Casper Refinery\nThe Management of the Sinclair Casper Refinery in Evansville, Wyoming recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both its workers and the local community. \nOur policy is to ensure that our efforts with prevention\u00bfthrough planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance, and communication with our neighbors\u00bfwill help us prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery operates a variety of processes in petroleum refining to produce products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, asphalt, butane, and propane) from raw crude oil. Most of the processes use heat, catalyst, and pressure to produce the above products from the crude. \nThe refinery has the following regulated flammables in its processes: \n\u00b7\tPentane (C5)\n\u00b7\tButane and isomers (C4)\n\u00b7\tPropane (C3)\n\u00b7\tEthane \n\u00b7\tMetha"

Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411, and must meet the requirements of Program Level 3.\nWe are reporting the following three regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\n\u00b7\tFlammable Mixture 1 (Light Gasoline): This represents the mixture of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons found in the piping and process units, and stored in Natural Gasoline tankage. The volumes of these hydrocarbons vary by day. The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture 1 onsite is 14 million pounds.\n\u00b7\tFlammable Mixture 2 (Mixed Butanes): This represents a butane/butene mix in storage. It is listed separately from Flammable Mixture 1 to distinguish the large storage area of the mixed butanes. The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture 2 onsite is 5.9 million pounds.\n\u00b7\tPropane. The maximum quantity of propane onsite is 2 million pounds.\nH2S and SO2 in the refinery do not meet threshold levels. We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes. Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP. Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\nIn the past, the Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers. With the release modeling required under RMP, Sinclair determined that the potential impact of chlorine on the surrounding community was not necessary. Therefore, we replaced chlorine with an alternate, non-gaseous treatment system. This treatment system is more expensive to operate, yet we felt it was essential to remove chlorine in order to improve the safety of the community and minimize any toxic footprint"

While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems. \nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Sinclair Casper Refinery. For the one RMP process being reported by Sinclair, encompassing the entire refinery, RMP allows us to use OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard as our prevention program. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP, and describes the system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\nThe elements are as follows:\n\u00b7\tEmployee Participation\n\u00b7\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00b7\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00b7\tOperating Procedures\n\u00b7\tTraining\n\u00b7\tContractors\n\u00b7\tPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\u00b7\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00b7\tSafe Work Practices\n\u00b7\tManagement of Change\n\u00b7\tIncident Investigation\n\u00b7\tCompliance Audits\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery encourages and invites employees to participate in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. \nEmployees have access to all information that is part of the accident prevention program. Copies of information that is used daily is located in the unit operations buildings for quick access. \nExamples of employee participation include participating in the HAZOP analysis of each unit, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information for their unit are"

Employees are also participants on our teams that address both process and worker safety. Teams are often comprised of representatives from plant management, safety, operations, environmental, maintenance, and engineering. \nProcess Safety Information\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery keeps technical and safety documentation for each unit that falls under the PSM standard. This information helps ensure and maintain safe operation for the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information. \nThe Safety, Engineering, and Maintenance departments are assigned responsibility within the plant to keep the process safety information updated. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the file in the Technical Manager\u00bfs office in the main building. Duplicate copies of critical information are included onsite in each control room.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, flow) used in monitoring and controlling operations. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these parameters using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems. \nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment."

This information is stored with the Inspection and Testing department.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery has a comprehensive analysis program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. \nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP is a very systematic and thorough evaluation of potential hazards in the process unit. The refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with a team formed of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering, and plant management. The team evaluates potential process hazards and identifies accident prevention and mitigation measures to ensure safe operating and maintenance of the units. The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures, or practices to put in place to ensure the hazards are managed and mitigated. \nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for review and resolution. Implementation of systems, procedures, and practices are based on a determination of risk with the items. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.
