Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up to date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continual employee training. \n\n\u00b7The facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.   Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\u00b7The facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. \n\n\u00b7Training of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices. \n\n\u00b7The facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all affected personnel receive training on the change. \n\n\nF. Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe  facility has not had an RMP reportable accident in the last five years.  We are confident that the policies and programs in place at our facility will help us to maintain our record in the years ahead.\n\nG.
