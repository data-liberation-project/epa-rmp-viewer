Louisville Works, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n                                                                                                                                                                              Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe DuPont Fluoroproducts site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown.\"  We operate two processes using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  One process produces HCFC-22 with HFC-23 and hydrogen chloride as by-products.  The second process produces vinyl fluoride.  Each process uses fluorine based technology and operates independently.  The site is fenced and entry is controlled by security personnel at all times.\n\nIn ou"
