Our Safety Policy Statement states our management's commitment to \"the safety of the public, our customers and our employees.\" This commitment to safety \"takes precedence over expedience in completing any work performed by District employees.\" Our emergency response plan includes active response by properly equipped and trained employees working with the local Fire\nDepartment Hazmat team. A full-time staff of safety and health professionals and a training staff support this strong commitment to safety and health.\n\nThe Platte West Water Treatment Plant is one of three water treatment facilities supplying drinking water to the City of Omaha, Nebraska and surrounding communities. Liquid chlorine and aqueous ammonia are used to produce chloramines for disinfection. Only chlorine at the Platte River Plant falls under the RMP rule. (The quantity of aqueous ammonia stored on the plant is 21,000 pounds at a concentration of 19.6%, resulting in 4116 total pounds of ammonia, which is below the RMP threshold of 20,000 pounds). The Chlorine Building houses four banks of six one-ton chlorine cylinders, with an additional 12 cylinders in storage. The plant is staffed 24 hours a day.\n\nThe responsibility for implementation and handling of the District's Risk Management Plan rests with the Vice President of Water Operations. Alternate program responsibilities are assigned to the Supervisor of the Platte River Plant, the Supervisor of the Platte West Plant, the Director of Water Production and Pumping, the Water Supply Engineer, the Director of Safety and Security, the Director of Training, and members of their technical and supervisory staffs. \n\nScenarios considered in evaluating a potential chlorine release include a \"worst-case\" release and an \"alternative\" release. Each scenario delineates an area in which significant public impacts could occur. Th"

The \"alternative\" scenario describes an event that is \"most likely\" to happen, in\nwhich the actual site conditions and usage patterns are used to estimate the severity of the discharge.\n\nSeveral ways to model the toxic endpoints are considered acceptable and were reviewed for use in development of the plan. Possible releases from the ton cylinders were modeled using the scenarios described in EPA's RMPComp.\n\nAll facilities used to house chlorine, whether the chlorine is in-use or in storage, meet or exceed industry standards. Equipment installed to facilitate the chloramination process and facilities to house chlorine are inspected periodically, and scheduled maintenance is performed to ensure system safety and reliability. \n\nSafety information necessary to ensure the facilities and processes meet or exceed codes, standards, and/or guidelines used in the development and installation of regulated requirements has been compiled and reviewed where appropriate. The safety information includes Chlorine Institute Pamphlets, local building and fire codes, National Electric Codes, American National Standards Institute pamphlets, manufacturer guides,\nand applicable state and federal safety codes.\n\nA hazard review of the chlorine storage and chloramination facilities was performed using the WTP Hazard Review Checklist for Chlorine Systems provided in the RMP plan for the Water Industry published by the American Water Works Association. The review included siting, operation and maintenance, hazard recognition, human factors, container shipment and unloading, piping and appurtenances, and general conditions. Any areas identified as needing further research were annotated and followed up on to ensure proper measures were implemented to correct deficiencies and mitigate hazards.\n\nOperating procedures used within the Risk Management Plan are addre"

This manual addresses normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, startup following turnaround, consequences of deviation, steps required to correct or avoid deviation, safety and health considerations, and safety systems. The District does not have any procedures for start-up or temporary operations, as disinfection is a permanent process. Chlorine manuals are located at the Operator's desk and in the Plant Supervisor's office.\n\nTraining includes Hazmat training for all Chemical Equipment Mechanics, operating procedure training for operating employees, and safety and health training and awareness training for all District employees involved directly with the disinfection process. Employees are trained on any new or updated procedures prior to implementation of the change. Since our last update over 190 employees have been trained in NIMS 100 and 700, plus 12 employees have received NIMS 200 training.  All training is certified, and documentation is kept in the training section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every three years using the checklist provided in the RMP plan for the Water Industry published by the American Water Works Association. In addition to this audit, the District performs annual safety and health inspections on all facilities used in the chlorine disinfection process. These inspections check for compliance with state and federal safety requirements, condition of facilities and equipment, availability of personal protective equipment, and safe work practices.  Copies of the inspection reorts are forwarded to the appropriate Manager/Supervisor for review and corrective action.  The Director of Safety and Security conducts follow-up until all deficiencies are corrected.  All compliance audits and safety reports are filed in the Compliance Audits section of the Plan.\n\nIn the event of an incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic rel"
