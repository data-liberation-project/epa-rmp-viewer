The JPWB leases the distribution systems to the cities.  The Board operates the water treatment plant and wholesales water to the cities.\n         The facility, which is  subject to RMP Program 3,  is situated in Section 22, T18N, R107W, Sweetwater County, Wyoming.  This facility is located adjacent to the Green River in the City of Green River at No. 3 Telephone Canyon Road.  The City of Green River occupies a narrow valley that rises abruptly from the river (elevation 6080' at water treatment facility) to developments at an approximate elevaton of 6450'.\n     The water treatment facility uses liquid chlorine as a secondary disinfectant.  The chlorine process area is constructed of concrete and is configured into three (3) distinct rooms.  This design allows separation of process components and addresses the containment issues in th event of a chlorine equipment failure.  The chlorine area houses ton cylinders of chlorine, vacuum feed chlorinators, and a caustic soda scrubber.  An exterior accessible-only room is provided for the storage of safety and emergency repair equipment.  The chlorine process area is typically unstaffed but will be visited daily by water treatment operators.  Each room is connected to the plant SCADA system which monitors the area on a continuous basis by way of chlorine leak detectors.\n     The EPA RMP \"Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance-Chlorine\" manual was utilized to determine \"worst case release\" (Table 1) and \"alternate scenario\" (Table 3).  At-Risk Population (receptors) estimates were obtained from the Sweetwater County Engineering office.  Using the Map Info Program (2000 Census data), receptors were identified within the planning radius for worst case and alternate release scenarios.  The water treatm"
