The Coosa WRF is owned and operated by the City of Rome, Georgia and is located at 650 Ausburn Road, Coosa, Georgia.  The Coosa WRF utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater. The facility employs the use of one-ton chlorine cylinders that are trucked to the plant site.  The Coosa WRF is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 (\"Chlorine Accident Prevention Provisions\") and the \"Program 2\" requirements of the rule.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the City's risk management program is to prevent accidental releases of chlorine and mitigate the severity of releases that may occur.  The program addresses specific actions the City will take to prevent accidental releases of chlorine and reduce the potential impact on the public and the environment.  The specfic actions include the continued implementation of a program containing the following key elements:\n\n*Off-site consequence analysis\n\n*5-year accident history\n\n*A management system to oversee and implement the program\n\n*A Prevention Program that includes:\n\n Chlorine safety information\n\n Operating Procedures\n\n Employee Training\n\n Preventative Maintenance\n\n Incident Investigation\n\n Compliance Audits\n\n Hazard Reviews\n\n An Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe City of Rome's senior management is strongly committed to safety.  The City of Rome's existing Loss Prevention Program requires that all accidents be reported as to the cause, and the corrective action taken to prevent future accidents.  Accidents are reviewed by the supervisor, safety officer, and department head to ensure that all accidents are addressed appropriately.  Unsafe condition reports are also available to all employees to ensure that all safety related matters, including chlorine, are given the highest priority.  Any accident involving chlorine requires a chlorine specific investigation in addition to the requirements of the Loss Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe C"

      "SummaryText": "ity of Rome maintains a Prevention Program that addresses basic, sound prevention practices.  Safety information includes general chlorine properties and hazards, a MSDS, an established maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower parameters for piping, and equipment specifications including the Codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.  Operational procedures for startup, shutdown, temporary, emergency, and normal operations are in place and have been revised as necessary to keep the program current.  Hazard review and program audit processes are in place to verify compliance with the program.  A training program covering basic chlorine safety, responder notification, SCBA use, and operational procedures is in place and ongoing.  Daily inspections of equipment are conducted and documented and testing of monitoring equipment is conducted at established intervals to insure readiness.\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the past five years.  Minor incidents have been investigated, documented, and corrective action taken to prevent future problems.\n\n\n\nThere were no major hazards noted during the recent hazard review.  \n\n\n\nThe Coosa WRF is by definition a \"non-responding\" facility.  A response to a chlorine release at the Coosa WRF is covered by the Rome-Floyd County Emergency Management Agency and the Rome-Floyd County Fire Department is designated as the first responder.  The Rome-Floyd County Fire Department, once notified, shall coordinate all release mitigation procedures and public notification.  A written notification and evacuation plan has been developed at the Coosa WRF to expedite this process."
