If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities,  to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and enviroment.\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 84,000 pounds.\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tand released as a gas over 10 minutes.  the maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is .39 mile.\nThe altermative relesae scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the altermative scenario is .06 miles.  This release has the possiblility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\nThis facility complies with EPA'S Accodemta; Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements fpr tje Storage and Handling  of Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.  as adopted by state regulations and the  standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years, that to ou"
