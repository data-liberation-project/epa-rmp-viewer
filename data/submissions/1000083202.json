Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nSpire has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nSpire's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. Spire's Belle Butte Plant has coordinated with the Evanston City Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Belle Butte Plant is located approximately 21 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming. Belle Butte is a gas storage facility. We withdraw, inject, and store natural gas. We receive and deliver gas to and from five interstate pipelines. We have an injection capacity of 350 million standard cubic feet per day and a withdrawal capacity of 100 million standard cubic feet per day. The Northwest Pipeline also ties in at Belle Butte. A 10-inch and a 16-inch pipeline transfer gas to and from Belle Butte and the Canyon Creek Compressor Station located 4 miles west. The Overthrust, Questar, and Kern River Pipelines also tie in at Canyon Creek.\n\n\n\nThe Ruby Lateral pipeline transfers gas to and from Canyon Creek and Gemstone, which is the tie-in with the Ruby Pipeline, 5 miles north. At Belle Butte, the major facility components include: the Belle Butte gas processing facility; three gas injection/withdrawal well pads, containing a total of six wells; and gas flow lines. During withdrawal operations, the wells produce gas, water, and condensate. Free water and condensate are separated from the gas stream in the three-phase separators. Produced water is"

      "SummaryText": " transferred through piping to the produced water tanks. It is then sent to the triplex pump, where it is injected downhole. The condensate is transferred through piping to the condensate tanks. The gas requires further processing before we send it to the customers. 120 million standard cubic feet per day travels through the hydrogen sulfide removal process, to a moisture removal process, then on to the Canyon Creek Compressor Station.\n\n\n\nNatural gas liquids (or NGLs) are removed from the gas and are stored in a 12,000-gallon pressurized storage vessel. The NGLs are then sold to a third-party vendor. In the Compressor Building, gas is compressed to and from the customers or to Belle Butte. At the Blending Building, gas is blended, diverted, or transferred to any of the interconnecting pipelines. Condensate is separated at both the Blending and Discharge Filter Buildings, then transferred to the condensate tank. The Ruby Let Down allows us to decrease the incoming and outgoing pressures on the Ruby Lateral. Gemstone is where we receive gas from and deliver gas to the Ruby Pipeline. The filter separator is used to remove liquids from the withdrawn gas prior to transferring the gas to Ruby.\n\n\n\nWhen set to the injection mode, the capacity of Belle Butte is 240 MMCF/D. Gas is received from the pipeline or pipelines and sent to any combination of the four compressors. After two stage compression the gas is delivered to one of 6 wells for injection or withdrawal: 9HA, 9BH, 9CH, 35H, 1AH, 1BH or any combination.  When set to the withdrawal mode, the capacity of the facility is 480 MMCF/D.\n\n \n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\nBELLE BUTTE SAFETY GUIDELINES \n\n- Weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, fighting, horseplay and gambling are strictly prohibited.\n\n- SMOKING is prohibited anywhere inside the fence at the facility. This includes all buildings and vehicles inside the fence.\n\n- For any contract company to be able to work"

No work may begin without verification of this listing.\n\n- Location - We must also maintain controlled access to the plant both for security reasons, and so we know exactly where you are in the event of an emergency.\n\n- Hot work permit - Contractor vehicles are required to obtain a hot work permit when they are inside of facility buildings or within designated hot work areas. Contractors must stop at the control room and obtain this permit prior to entry. The plant is divided into classified (Hazardous) and unclassified areas depending on the potential presence of sources of combustion. Before any work begins that requires open flames or has the potential for causing sparks or extreme heat in a classified area, a Hot Work Permit must be obtained. This permit requires answering several questions pertaining to eliminating potential hazards and also includes a thorough check of the area with a combustible gas monitor.  This insures that all sources of combustion have been identified and eliminated. If you need a Hot Work Permit or have any questions as to whether or not the work you will be doing requires one, please check with the operator on duty in the control room.\n\n- Sign-in sheet - All persons must sign in at the control room upon entering the facility and sign out before exiting.\n\n- Safety clothing - A hardhat, safety glasses, Flame Resistant Clothing w/ long sleeves, and steel- toed shoes are required as minimum protection. When needed, rubber gloves, goggles, face shields, are available on location. Certain areas of the plant require that hearing protection be worn due to excessive noise levels. These areas are well posted, and dispensers for hearing protection can be found at each one, as well as in the control room.\n\n- Safety meeting - Prior to beginning work, a pre-job safety meeting may be required covering the job scope, relative safety concerns, applicable Safety Data Sheets and a"

If at any time you have questions concerning safety or your work assignment, you may ask any Spire employee for assistance.\n\n- Safety Data Sheets (SDS) - Safety Data Sheets or SDS's are located in a binder kept in control room and are available to view. \n\n- Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) - LOTO must be used when working on electrical or mechanical devices or anything with the potential for a release of energy.\n\n- Ladders/step-ladders - Visually inspect your ladder before use. Do not use the top platform as a step. Be sure the ladder is set up on solid ground before use.  If the job requires working at a height in excess of 6 feet, you must also wear a safety harness and a lifeline. If the ladders being used belong to the plant, they must be returned to the storage area upon completion of the project.\n\n- Tripping hazards - From time to time laying extension cords, air & water hoses, tubing lines and piping across walkways are unavoidable. Try to minimize tripping hazards by not laying any more than needed across a known walkway and by taping down cords and hoses. Safety cones may also be used to aid in employee awareness and prevent accidents.\n\n- Confined space entry - You may not enter any vessel or any excavation exceeding 4 feet in depth without a Confined Space Entry Permit. The use and issuance of this permit will be explained in the pre-job safety meeting by plant personnel as the need arises.\n\n- Identifying hazards - A potential hazard must be encircled with caution tape, marked with safety cones, posted with signs, or a combination of all three to ensure that the hazard is easily identifiable. Report hazards to Spire personnel.\n\n- Sirens - In the event of an emergency an emergency siren will be activated. All ESD buttons located throughout the facility activate the siren/alarms.
