We are an agricultural based business that primarily buys and sells grain as well as other inputs necessary for crop production.\n\nOur NH3 plant consist of two anhydrous tanks, one-12,000-gallon, the other a 26,000 gallon tank with associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The total capacity of the plant is 162,000 pounds when filled to 85% capacity. \n\n The worst case scenario for our Anhydrous ammonia would be failure of the 26,000-gallon tank,  resulting in a gas release of 114,000 pounds over a 10 minute period.  According to our guide, distance to endpoint is 2.32 miles with an approximate population of approx 1100 area residents.  Public receptors include a school, churches, residences and several recreation areas.  The alternative release scenario has a distance to endpoint of .83 miles and has the potential to affect 957 residents.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, are regulations.   The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed,and maintained in accordance with Kansas State Ag Department, which inspects our plant annually and we respond to all their request for improvement.\n\n We are pleased to report we have had no accidents in the past five years at this facility, and hope to maintain this good safety record, by constantly upgrading and reviewing our safety procedures and practices.  Our employees are trained annually in the safe use of the product, the hazards of NH3, proper plant maintenance practices as well as the recommended operatimg procedures.  The employees always wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during nurse tank filling operations.  Clean safety water is always on hand during these operations. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving  our anhydrous system, it is this company's pol"
