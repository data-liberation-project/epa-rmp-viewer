The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nAntonio Leal, Water Plant Superintendent, is the responsible official at the Edinburg Water Filtration Plant. The Water Filtration Plant is located at 500 E. Mahl, Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building sits on the south side of the plant and consists of a ten by ten-foot room with two, 1-ton Chlorine cylinders next to the building and facing north. One cylinder is operational and the other used for backup. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility 24-hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage occupies locati"

A Worst-Case Release\n\n2. An Alternative Scenario\n\nThe EPA guidelines define AWorst-Case Release@ resulting from an unspecified failure in which, AThe owner-operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes.@ The same guidelines define an AAlternative Scenario@ as, AMore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.@\n\n\n\nPerformance of atmospheric dispersion modeling determines the distance traveled by a parameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the Atoxic endpoint@. The EPA defines Atoxic endpoint@ as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. This value corresponds to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations, which the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines as:\n\n\n\nAThe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual?s ability to take protection action.@\n\n\n\nThe estimated population potentially affected by the release equals the residential population within the radius of a circle corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\n\nThe following conditions define the Worst-Case Release Scenario at the Edinburg Water Filtration Plant:\n\n\n\n?    Failure of two, 1-ton containers resulting in the total release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine;\n\n\n\n?    Release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes;\n\n\n\n?
