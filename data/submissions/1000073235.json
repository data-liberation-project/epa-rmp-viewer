Stateline Processing, LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe plant is designed to treat and process natural gas.  Processing of natural gas is performed by cryogenic means, requiring propane as a refrigerant.  Propane is stored in a pressurized vessel (bullet tank V-1931).  The vessel capacity is 6,500-gallons, but is kept half full or less.  Maximum intended inventory of propane in the vessel is 3,250 gallons, or about 15,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nCryogenic natural gas processing yields natural gas liquid (NGL) products, which are stored in pressurized vessels (bullet tanks V-1206 and V-422) prior to shipment offsite via pipeline.  These vessels are each close to 30,000 gallons in size and intended to be kept at 40% product or less.  NGL in each vessel is approximately 50,000 pounds, or about 100,000 pounds total.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility operates a stabilization process to reduce vapor pressure of recovered condensate for storage in atmospheric tanks.  Condensate is heated to drive off volatile components, which are captured and sent back to the natural gas processing system.  A process flow-through tank (V-1201) is utilized to capture off-specification condensate identified b"

Training\r\n\r\nStateline Processing, LLC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nF.

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nStateline Processing, LLC has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically examines for potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP).  HAZOP is a structured and systematic examination of a planned or existing process or operation in order to identify and evaluate problems that may represent risks to personnel or equipment, or prevent efficient operation.  A HAZOP is a qualitative technique based on guide-words and is carried out by a multi-disciplinary team. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
