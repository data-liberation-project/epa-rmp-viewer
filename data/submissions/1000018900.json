      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPioneer Trail Energy, LLC\n\nPioneer Trail Energy, LLC (PTE) started operation in 2008 under different management than it is operating today.  The RMP was first submitted prior to plant startup in anticipation that the current management would operate the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\nPTE has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  PTE is covered under BioFuel Energy's corporate safety policy which is reviewed with all employees at least once a year.\n\nPTE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will assist local emergency responders to contain and control the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nPTE's ethanol plant is located in Wood River, Hall County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program are Aqueous Ammonia (concentration 20% or greater) and Denaturant, which is consists of natural gasoline, a flammable mixture. \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 74,400 gallons of aqueous ammonia solution creating a toxic cloud or a release of 116,900 gallons of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion. \n\nPrevention Program\nPTE has numerous administrative controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences and both the aqueous ammonia and denaturant tanks are contained in secondary containment dikes.  These passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Pr"

      "SummaryText": "ogram 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been implemented at this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThere have been no reportable spills of aqueous ammonia or denaturant since the startup of PTE.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe PTE plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including an Emergency Action Plan, Facility Response Plan, and SPCC Plan.  Training is conducted on each of these programs every year.  In addition, the facility conducts drills including tabletop exercises, and spill response drills coordinated with the Wood River Fire Department and the Grand Island Fire Department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nPTE is in the process of reviewing and updating numerous plans and programs to improve safety.  Some of the current initiatives include implementing the STOP&copy; program and empowering the facility safety committee to actively participate and lead the safety culture at the plant."
