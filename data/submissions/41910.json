In fulfilling this commitment KRO will provide and maintain a safe and healthy work environment as indicated by acceptable business practices and compliance with legislative requirements and will strive to eliminate any foreseeable hazards that could result in fires, security losses, damage to property and personal injuries or illnesses.  All management functions including business, line and associated management will comply with Kettle River Operations' loss prevention requirements as they apply to the design operation and maintenance of facilities and equipment.  All employees will perform their jobs properly in accordance with established procedures and operating philosophy.\n\nThe KRO facility's primary activity is gold mining, concentrating and refining.  Two regulated substances, sulfur dioxide and propane are present at the facility above 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities.  Sulfur dioxide is used in a patented process to transform cyanide into various non-toxic nitrogen compounds before the treated mill effluent is stored in a tailings facility.  The maximum inventory of our sulfur dioxide storage process is 150,000 pounds. Propane is used as a fuel for heating the mill facility.  The maximum inventory of our propane storage process is 100,000 pounds. \n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the extent of such a release include tank-filling procedures and training, automatic shutoff valves, release monitors and alarms, transfer-line handling procedures, and tank-level and pressure restrictions. Administrative controls for sulfur dioxide include a safety-based tank-level restriction such that the tank is never filled beyond 87 percent of its total capacity.  Administrative controls for propane include a safety-based tank-level restriction such that the tank is never filled beyond 80 percent of its total capacity.\n\n"

A hazard review was conducted to identify hazards associated with Sulfur Dioxide and Propane storage and handling, opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that could cause an accidental release, safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error, and any steps needed to detect or monitor releases.  KRO uses standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with the Sulfur Dioxide and Propane processes, including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, normal shutdowns, startup following a normal or emergency shutdown, consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid deviations, and equipment inspections.  KRO also provides training and competency testing for all employees assigned to these processes.  Written maintenance procedures are designed to ensure the ongoing mechanical integrity of the Sulfur Dioxide and Propane process equipment, and maintenance personnel are provided with training in the hazards of the process and how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  The process equipment is inspected and tested in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.  Regular compliance audits are conducted to ensure Kinross Gold Co. ? Kettle River Operations remains in compliance with the RMP Rule prevention program requirements. \n\nDue to the stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during the past five years.\n\nKettle River's emergency response plan addresses accidental releases of hazardous materials, as well as other concerns such as first aid and emergency medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Procedures for the use and inspection of emergency response equipment are outline"

In addition, the response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo improve safety, Kinross Gold Co. ? Kettle River Operations will continue to meet and exceed applicable MSHA safety standards, evaluate standard operating procedures, hold safety meetings monthly or more frequently, and conduct emergency response training at various levels for all mine employees.  These actions will ensure the safe use of sulfur dioxide and propane."
