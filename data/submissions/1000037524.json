LFUCG has implemented the elements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the corresponding Process Safety Management Program (PSM) to prevent and minimize the impact of the accidental release of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan for the Town Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant has been prepared in accordance with EPA guidelines (40 CFR 68) and has been developed for this facility. The Town Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant is located in Lexington, Kentucky, 301 Lisle Industrial Avenue and is operated by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government - Division of Water Quality. \n\n\n\nThe primary function of this facility is the treatment of wastewater, in doing so Chlorine is used for disinfection purposes and Sulfur Dioxide is used for the neutralization of chlorine in plant effluent. The probability of a release at this facility is classified as low.  The enclosed Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide building with alarmed detection systems will notify plant staff if a leak should occur. The air scrubber systems start automatically if a leak is detected. These systems will greatly reduce the risk of a release from reaching the outside atmosphere. \n\n\n\nThe maximum chlorine stored at this site is 20 one ton cylinders.  The maximum sulfur dioxide stored at this site is 8 one ton cylinders.  Based on the quantity of regulated chemicals in each covered process the facility is subject to Program 3 of the Risk Management Progr"

The risk of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release from the system piping was significantly reduced when this process change was implemented due to the fact that the individual regulators upon loss of vacuum will immediately close the gas cylinder.  This action results in the system shutting itself down if there is a process piping or delivery system malfunction.\n\n\n\nIf a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak occurred, LFUCG Division of Water Quality employees and the LFUCG Fire Department are well prepared and trained to respond to the situation. LFUCG employees are trained in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide. They are also trained on initial startup procedures, normal operating procedures, temporary operating procedures, emergency operating procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, normal shutdown procedures, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown procedure.\n\n\n\nThe following agencies are available to respond to a chemical release at the Town Branch Wastewater Plant: Lexington Fire Department and Fayette Division of Emergency Management. Other responding agencies are: State Fire Marshall's Office, Commonwealth Emergency Response Commission (CERC), Kentucky DES Area Coordinator, Kentucky Department for Natural Environmental Protection, and Chemtrac.  The primary response agency to a chemical release at this site is the Lexington Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and process building is designed to contain a release and minimize release to the atmosphere.

The detection will activate the alarm system to notify the plant operators, shut down the ventilation system, and activate the scrubber system. \n\n\n\nTown Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant has a comprehensive and thorough emergency response plan. In the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak or spill, all personnel are trained to immediately proceed with the following:\n\n\n\n1. Notify Plant Operations Supervisor Senior and then the Solids Process Supervisor.\n\n\n\n2. Plant Operations, Solids Process Supervisor, or their designee along with Plant Operator on duty will investigate the leak and determine if the leak is minor or major (based on gas levels in ppm established in the facility's emergency plan). \n\n3. Minor leak - Plant Operator on duty and Supervisor or designee to repair.\n\n\n\n4. Major leak - initiate chlorine evacuation plan and notify response agencies.\n\n\n\nLFUCG conducts awareness training for newly hired employees on the safety and safe practices related to working around the covered process areas.  Training for operators, maintenance personnel, and other staff who have specific job duties and responsibilities in the covered process areas is conducted periodically according to an established training program for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  Employees involved in the covered processes are given new training based on management of changes required by process, procedure, or other changes that would affect the processes.  All operating employees have been given extensive training in operating procedures, maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nAs required, LFUCG has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) of processes based on process changes; and has conducted a formal compliance audit (CA) of the RMP program.  The PHA and the CA teams were facilitated by a person knowledgeable in the PHA and CA methodology and supported by LFUCG staff that has direct respo"
