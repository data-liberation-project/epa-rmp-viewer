      "SummaryText": "Stationary source and regulated substances handled \r\n\r\nThe El Paso Facility of Isomedix Operations Inc. (Steris Applied Sterilization Technologies) uses ethylene oxide (EtO) to sterilize pre-packaged supplies for health care facilities.  EtO is highly effective in killing bacteria, insects, and fungi and serves as an efficient means for sterilization in systems where heat cannot be used to kill such organisms. The use of EtO as a sterilant has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was first introduced. However, EtO is a hazardous substance (it is both flammable and toxic), such that storing and handling EtO without proper precautions can present a risk to employees and the public. The El Paso Facility considers safe practices in storing and using EtO to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with EtO.\r\nThe El Paso Facility incorporates two sterilization processes on contiguous property in the Vista del Sol Industrial Park, with a main address at 1435 Isomedix Place in El Paso, Texas. The original plant has been using EtO since 1990 and is referred to as the EL Plant. The newer plant began routine operation in 2009 and is referred to as the E2 Plant. Located on contiguous property to the EL Plant, the E2 Plant has an address of 1441 Don Haskins Drive. EtO is received in drums into designated storage areas at both the EL Plant and the E2 Plant.\r\nThe El Paso Facility is subject to EPA regulation 40 CFR 68 and has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission because an accidental release of EtO could cause a toxic impact offsite. In addition, the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule at 29 CFR 1910.119 because EtO is both toxic and flammable and would impact employee safety if it were released onsite.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe El Paso Facility's accidental release prevention program integrates proven technology, equipment maintenance, em"

In addition, the EtO supply drums are bonded, grounded and chained, and only non-sparking tools are used to make drum connections. The lines are purged with nitrogen prior to change out of drums and empty drums receive a nitrogen over-blanket. EtO from each supply drum is vaporized prior to its introduction into the vessels. The nitrogen gas is also steam heated prior to its introduction into the sterilization chambers. The chambers are computer controlled by a programmable logic control system and a system of passwords ensures that only authorized personnel have access to the controls.\r\nBoth EtO processes at the facility (including the drum storage rooms) are equipped with an EtO removal and destruction system. \r\n   - The EL Plant system has a Hydrox Scrubber System plus two Donaldson Abator (thermal oxidizer) units. Exhaust from the sterilization chambers is delivered to the Hydrox Scrubber system where the spent EtO is converted into ethylene glycol. Exhaust from the aeration rooms is routed to the abator units to combust the gas mixture and convert EtO to carbon dioxide and water. In addition, the EL Plant EtO storage room is provided with three safe-cell systems. Each safe cell is capable of destructing 150 pounds of EtO should there be a leak. The EtO removal efficiency in the safe-cells is about 99%. The safe-cells are activated by the EtO monitoring system (baseline monitoring system), which has an EtO sensor inside the EtO storage room. \r\n   - The E2 plant has passive hydrolyzers followed by active, packed bed wet scrubbing hydrolyzers which convert spent EtO into ethylene glycol. The storage room and sterilizers are vented to one of the active packed bed wet scrubbers to convert any fugitive EtO releases into ethylene glycol.\r\nThe EL Plant and the E2 Plant at the El Paso Facility are each equipped wi"

The facility is also equipped with combustible gas sensors, located in the sterilizer rooms and EtO drum rooms. Sensors are set to alarm at 1,500 ppm (EtO) and will activate an evacuation alarm in the control Room. A second alarm is set at 50% of the lower explosive limit of EtO (15,000 ppm). This alarm will activate a remote red strobe light located in the electrical room for the purposes of emergency response planning. Each instrument is also equipped with an oxygen sensor set to alarm at 19% by volume of oxygen to air.\r\nThe El Paso Facility emergency response policy involves the preparation of Emergency Action Plans specific to each plant (EL and E2), which facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and contractors in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \r\n\r\nBecause EtO storage and use at the El Paso Facility is subject to both the EPA RMP rule and the OSHA PSM rule, the prevention programs at the El Paso Facility (for the EL and ES plant EtO processes) adhere to the elements of OSHA PSM, as follows: \r\n- Process Safety Information - Comprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of EtO. This information includes EtO background information and MSDS sheets and equipment safety information. Specifications for EtO process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference.
