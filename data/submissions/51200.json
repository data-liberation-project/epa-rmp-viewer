      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIn this Chlorine Supply facility, we handle Chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make Chlorine valuable as a Health ingredient chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling Chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing he threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle Chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Madison County 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies, the Marble Volunteer Fire Department, then the notification of Rick Tucker, Owner/Operator @ 479-790-9355, the Madison County Sheriff\u00bfs Department will help notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Madison County LEPC.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to supply the area Poultry Industry with Chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinder vessels located in a shed on the south of the facility.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the Marble, AR location is Chlorine.  The maximum amount of Chlorine that can be stored at this plant is approximately 3,000 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found in all of the storage vessels.\n\nThe worst-case scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario is failure of the largest storage tank (bob-tail truck) when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release approximately 1,200 pounds of Chlorine from the Marble, AR location.  Passive mitigation was considered for this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/1 for the worst-case scenario is 2.2  miles.  This location is classified as rural due to the minimal amounts of obstructions around the site, although there are hills and ridges nearby.\n\nAn alternative scenario (a malfunction of a cylinder or leak) was determined for this facility.  Estimation, based on the operational flow rate, cross section area of vessel, and operational pressure of cylinder, using the RMP Comp Software, a release from this type of vessel would result in a release of approximately 100 pounds per minute released into the atmosphere.  This release could be due to mechanical error.  This amount of vapor a Chlorine release would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.2 miles.\n\nThis supply facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc.  We have discussed this program with the Madison County LEPC, the Madison County Sheriff\u00bfs Department, as well as the Marble Volunteer Fire Department.  A representative of Environmental Services Group, Inc. visited this plant on February 2, 2008, which prompted a review of our written safety procedures, operating and maintenance procedures, our prevention program, and our emergency response plans.\n\nThis facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to this facility."
