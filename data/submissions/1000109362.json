After additional processing, the Facility also generates and stores for off-site transfer other products extracted from the NGL.  \n\nThe Plaquemine PP1 PP2 Plan has no RMP-regulated toxic substances stored above RMP threshold quantities; therefore, the offsite consequences analysis only considered flammable substances.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nBecause the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Plaquemine Plant's PSM Plan is kept on-site as a separate document. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Plaquemine Plant has not had an accidental release of NGL, butane, isobutane, ethane, or propane that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the life of the Facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBecause the Plaquemine Plant is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Emergency Response Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility does maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated emergency response with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) and the Plaquemine Fire Department, which is also designated as the first responder in the event of flammable material release.   \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are ma"

      "SummaryText": "EnLink Plaquemine PP1 PP2 Plan is in Iberville Parish in Louisiana. Its coordinates are 30.234182 N, -91.239881 W. The address for the facility is 60995 Derrick Rd Plaquemine, LA 70764.\n\nThe Plaquemine PP1 PP2 Plan consists of Amine Gas Treating and Regeneration, Glycol Dehydration and Regeneration, CRYO Plant, Fractionation Process, Propane / Butane / Gasoline pressurized storage tanks, and atmospheric condensate storage tanks.\nThe Plaquemine PP1 PP2 Plan is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 because it consists of more than the threshold quantity of a \u0093regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\u0094. The total regulated flammable substance at the facility is 3,438,117 lbs. (including 10% to account for piping). The table below lists the regulated substances.\n\nThe Plaquemine PP1 PP2 Plan was determined to be a Program Level 1. The facility is eligible for Program level 1 as no public receptors (residential unit) are located within the distance to endpoint of 1 psi overpressure (0.5 miles) from a vapor cloud explosion in worst case release scenario. In addition, Plaquemine PP1 PP2 Plan had no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years.\n\nThe Plaquemine Plant employs twenty-one (2) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.   \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Plaquemine Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction and separation operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction and separation processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \n\nThe Plaquemine Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of an NGL, butane, isobutane, ethane, or propane release.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Plaquemine Plant processes NGL in various aboveground vessels"
