We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturer?s Association, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care.  As such, we are in the process of developing an Environmental Management System to continue improvement in Environmental, Health and Safety programs.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.\n\nIt is the policy of Lynx Chemical Group to develop, manufacture, and distribute materials with minimal impact on the environment and without injury to our employees, customers, and community.  To that end, Lynx Chemical Group is committed to:\n\n?    The protection of the health, safety, and security of our employees and facilities;\n?    Complying with all applicable federal, state and local Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security regulations and our other related voluntary requirements including Responsible Care;\n?    Continual reduction of the impact of our operations on the environment through ongoing pollution prevention programs;\n?    Continual communications and openness with our stakeholders;\n?    Training all employees regarding the importance of EHS&S protection and roles they play as stewards.vironmental, Health and Safety programs.  \n\nWe have implemented maintenance and inspection programs that ensure site integrity.

Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, isolated storage of flammable chemicals away from other chemicals and materials that could burn, fire fighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  The local fire department is also familiar with our site.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant is primarily involved in manufacturing sodium glucoheptonate and blending chemical formulations used by the carpet industry.  As a part of this manufacturing process, we use two substances that are covered by the risk management program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  However, we also use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the facility and a list of RMP-regulated processes at our facility.\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant is located on a 26.76 acre site.  The covered chemicals currently in use a the site are anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  Both processes are subject to Program Level 3.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as (1) operating limits for the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and (3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes.\n\nChemical information is usually documented within Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical.  This information typically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical data, (3) reactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and chemical stability data, and (5) hazards of mixing substances together.  MSDSs are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.  All chemicals on site have an MSDS.\n\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams, and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each process.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.

The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.   The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes. \n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant also operates using the Lynx Chemical Group batchsheet system.  Batchsheets are the detailed operating procedures for making a batch of product.  The batchsheets include process deviation codes describing the actions to take under various conditions (e.g., high temperature, high pressure, loss of cooling, etc) that may be encountered while manufacturing batches using highly haza"

Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.

      "SummaryText": " are introduced or existing prevention measures are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and (4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete, and (4) a process hazard analysis has been performed, if necessary.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injury to employees, the public, or the environment.  Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and provide recommendations for ensuring that the incident does not recur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolve"

Employees are routinely asked to participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, management of change hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program, and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas.  The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan, DAL-AD02.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of our employees.  Examples of these procedures include (1) a hot work permit that is designed to control spark- or flame-producing activities, (2) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry, and (3) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance.  These procedures and permits ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant uses contractors for various activities, such as maintenance and construction. All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner.  A contractors safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.\nOnce a contractor is selected, the Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, (3) understand the emergency respo"

Our personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\nRelease detection\n?    Automatic detection of vapors with alarms\n?    Procedures require that a Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant employee be present during loading and unloading operations\n?    Release containment and control\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n?    Manual shutdown systems \n?    Diked areas designed to"
