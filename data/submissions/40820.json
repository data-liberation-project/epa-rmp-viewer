The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.   The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes. \n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant also operates using the Lynx Chemical Group batchsheet system.

Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Lynx Chemical Group-Dalton plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.
