Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Williams Water Treatment Plant (Williams Plant) is part of Water Utilities a division of the City of Lakeland, Florida. The City of Lakeland requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training.\n\n2.  Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Williams Plant is located at 1501 West Bella Vista Street in the north west corner of Lakeland, Florida. The plant consists of filtration, clarification, flouridation and purfication processes that treat drinking water for the City of Lakeland. \n\nThe Williams Plant adds chlorine to the filtered water as a purification agent. The chlorination process is located in a three-walled, covered building at the southeast corner of the property, where liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to sixteen one-ton containers.  Six containers are always connected to the chlorination system, and up to ten are stored nearby.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time ranges from 12,0000 to 32,000 lbs.  This exceeds the 2,500-lb. RMP threshold quantity.\n\n3.  Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Lakeland considers its processes as subject to PSM and has implemented a PSM program at all facilities which have PSM listed processes.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Williams Plant process in the Program 3 level.  The Williams facility will use their PSM programs as the required RMP Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Williams Plant has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1919.119.  The PSM Program was established in 1997 for the chlorine process.  The progra"
