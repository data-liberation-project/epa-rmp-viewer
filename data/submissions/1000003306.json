The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Farmers Cooperative Exchange (Corn) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\u00c2\u00bf  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00c2\u00bf  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\u00c2\u00bf  The maximum quantity stored would be 183,855 pounds in our 30,000 gallon tank and our 12,000 gallon tank, or 180,000 pounds combined. Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 183,855 pounds is rounded to 180,000. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 131,325 pounds is rounded to 130,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.5 miles. (This distance is rounded to two significant digits).\n\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n \n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the"

The Five-year Accident History \n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\u00c2\u00bf  To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
