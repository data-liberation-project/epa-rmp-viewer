There are Program 2 and Program 3 elements the Kugler Company has yet to implement.  Since, the RMP-Esubmit software permit does not allow blank dates, we have used \"11/11/11\" to mark those elements for future implementation.  Corrections will be filed in a timely manner upon implementation of the elements.\n\n\n\nOn 8/6/14, Region 7 EPA performed an audit at the Culbertson Production Plant.  Kugler believes this event qualifies as a \"review or revision\" of respective element the date is listed with.\n\n\n\n**End of notes**\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary, continued:\n\n\n\nCulbertson Production Plant\n\n\n\nThe Culbertson Plant is located in a rural setting on the edge of the corporate limits of Culbertson, Nebraska.  The facility converts and blends raw feed stocks to produce a variety of liquid products to be used as agricultural fertilizer in surrounding areas.  Kugler Oil Company, the parent of the Culbertson Plant is a family owned corporation located in McCook, Nebraska.  The owners live in McCook, surrounded by friends and neighbors who are also their customers.  The principal officers of the parent company as well as nearly all the employees at the Culbertson location are very active in the affairs of their local communities and are as interested in the health and welfare of their neighbors as they are of their own families.\n\n\n\nThe facility has three large pressure vessels for the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia, and one vessel for propane. The various grades of fertilizers plus all the other chemicals used and stored at this facility are not considered hazardous or are stored below the threshold amounts to be considered under Part 68 of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nIn constructing this plan, many alternative scenarios were envisioned which could involve the accidental release of ammonia or propane gas. The most probable of these unlikely scenarios might be the release of exce"

With the release of 100 pounds of liquid material over a ten minute period, the maximum predicted travel of the resulting vapor cloud would only involve about twelve persons residing within the predicted 0.1 mile radius in the case of either toxic or flammable gas. \n\n\n\nThe Kugler Oil Company has always been very pro-active in meeting accepted industry standards for storage and handling of the various chemicals with which they deal.  Safety is of paramount concern and to that end they hire an internal Safety Director,  provide for a Safety Committee that meets regularly and in addition work with an outside firm for safety overview and guidance.   .\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely scenario where an ammonia vapor cloud would leave the premises of the Culbertson Plant, our employees are trained to inform the local population. Coordination has been effected with the Hitchcock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) whose agencies can provide for notification of those residents likely to be affected so that they may in turn evacuate the area. \n\n\n\nThe Kugler Company at this and all similar locations requires that all materials and procedures meet the State of Nebraska and Industry Standards, ANSI 61, for construction of ammonia handling facilities and NFPA 58 standards for LP gas storage and handling.  Our goal is to be a good neighbor and maintain an operation in consonance with the natural environment and the surrounding residents.\n\n\n\nSince the time of its acquisition in the early sixties, there have been no reportable releases (greater than 100 pounds) from this facility.  The Company attributes this to the knowledge and experience of employees and supervisors to be key to this flawless record.  \n\n\n\nAccess to this plant is funneled through a single entrance which passes around the administrative building.  The storage tanks are in plain sight of employees at this facility and are visually monitored to p"
