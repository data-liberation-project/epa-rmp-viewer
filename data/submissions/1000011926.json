The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor requirements.  Equipment included under this covered process includes (1) a 8,500-gallon commercial truck, (2) an 18,000-gallon storage tank and ancillary pumps, piping, and valves, (3) a nurse tank filling area and ancillary piping, valves, and hoses, and (4) 25 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 8,500-gallon commercial truck.  The commercial truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank.  This transfer process is conducted by the commercial truck operator.  Helena does not own or operate the commercial truck.  The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to comply with the RMP, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its RMPr Document upon request.\n",

Helena does not own or operate the process.  The IFRC is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the IFRC must (1) have in place and certify compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management Plan (PSM), (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any documentation necessary to comply with the PSM and RMP, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading and reactor operations and that its PSM support programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  The Helena Operations Manager is responsible for evaluating the IFRC past performance under the RMP program and for providing notification to the LEPC and Fire Department when it's IFRC intends to operate the reactor.  Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its contractors for review and implementation of emergency notifications procedures and a copy of its RMP Program Document upon request.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Albion Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Albion Facility located at 2493 State Highway 14, Albion, NE 68620.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Albion Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Albion Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP to include three different covered processes: (1) a temporary ammonia storage process (Railcar or Commercial Truck); (2) a temporary fertilizer reacting process; and (3) an on-site Tank Storage and Filling.  The railcar and commercial truck temporary storage and fertilizer reacting covered processes have changed from Program 2 to Program 3, and the on-site tank storage and filling covered process is a Program 2.  Helena is resubmitting this RMP as a 5-Year update.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and the alternative case release scenarios for each covered process.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Albion Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via commercial truck and possibly railcar.   Anhydrous ammonia is either (1) temporarily stored in the transportation container (i.e. Railcar or Commercial Truck) until it is reacted with phosphoric acid in a mobile pipe reactor and then diluted with water, or (2) stored in the onsite 18,000-gallon storage tank until it is either transferred into a 1,000-gallon nurse tank and sol"

Helena does not own or operate the reacting process, but does operate the tank storage and transfer into nurse tank process.  \n\nThe reacting process and its ancillary unloading procedures (i.e. from a railcar, commercial truck, or on-site tank storage) are performed by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  After the reacting process is complete, any residual anhydrous ammonia is stored in the transportation containers until the transportation company removes the container from the Helena Facility.\n\nThe on-site tank storage and transfer to nurse tank process are performed by qualified and trained Facility personnel.  Facility personnel conduct the storage and transfer procedures in accordance with its Operating Procedures.  \n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for each covered process (i.e. Railcar, Reacting, and Tank Storage).  The worst case scenario release for the Albion Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a single railcar or single storage tank) are released.  The release was modeled as if the railcar or storage tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for the Railcar covered process assumes that a vapor valve is leaking or is not fully closed.  (The scenario actually assumes the valve is only 50% closed.)  The alternative scenario for the Reacting and Tank Storage covered processes are the same and assumes that liquid transfer line up to 1.5-inches in diameter is severed during the reacting or filling process.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as di"

      "SummaryText": "rected.  The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Helena employees.  Helena employees inspect the markings on transportation containers (Railcar or Commercial Trucks) to ensure that the containers are operated within the U.S. DOT required inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the containers are not overfilled.  Helena employees also conduct inspections of railcars, commercial trucks, and its on-site storage tank for leaking valves and fittings in accordance with the accident program detailed in the Risk Management Program document.  \n\nThe reacting process prevention program is implemented by the IFRC because Helena does not own or operate the reacting process.  Helena requires the IFRC to certify its compliance with a Process Safety Management Plan and it spot checks some aspects of the contractor's PSM documentation (e.g. maintenance, training records) to ensure that the Contractor is complying with its PSM Plan.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena's Albion Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.  Helena has a written Contingency Plan that includes procedures to notify local emergency response agencies in event of a significant ammonia release.  Helena employees will not, under any circumstance, serve as first responders to a significant release of ammonia.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Albion Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION"
