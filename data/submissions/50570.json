      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Poet Biorefining-Leipsic facility is located approximately one and\n a half mile northeast of Leipsic, Ohio.  Poet Biorefining-Leipsic\u00bfs\n main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.\n  Production at the facility was initiated in January 2008.  Poet\n Biorefining-Leipsic produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed\n with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and\n liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is\n added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is\n added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled,\n then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous\n ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two\n 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas\n condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per\n federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored (primarily)\n in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 112,800 gallons\n (approximately 710,000 pounds), and potentially in Tank No. 802, which has a\n capacity of 250,000 gallons (approximately 1,574,000 pounds).  NGC is blended\n in-line with the ethanol and transferred to vehicles for transport\n off-site.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank\n trucks and rail cars.\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention Program\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which\n exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.\n  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage\n tank and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The\n denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 2% to 5%.  The\n greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping\n system is the quantity in the denaturant st"
