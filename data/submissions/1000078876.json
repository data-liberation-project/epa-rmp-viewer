This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Longview Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Longview Plant is one of the many facilities operated by Midcoast.  The facility utilizes a cyrogenic process to recover natural gas liquids from a rich natural gas stream.  These liquids are fractionated to produce an ethane/propane product (EP mix) and a butane-plus product.  These products, along with the residue gas, are transmitted by pipeline. \n\n\n\nThe inlet gas enters a Gilmer and Paxton scrubber to remove entrained liquids.  The liquid from the the scrubber passes through to a low-pressure flash tank. The low-pressure separator pumps the liquids into the condensate tanks.  Water is drained off to the water tank.  Condensate is sent to one of two (2) 400-bbl storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThe inlet gas leaves the scrubber and enters a molecular sieve dehydrator where water is removed from the gas prior to entering the cyroge"

The demethanizer residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed employing two turbine compressors for sale as high pressure gas. The liquid hydrocarbons (Natural Gas Liquids) separated in the cyrogenic/turboexpander/demethanized process are fed into a liquid-liquid treater and is treated for CO2 removal with diethanolamine (DEA).  The Y-Grade product is sent to the fractionation process where the EP mix is separated from the butane and heavier species.  The butane-plus stream is sent to two (2) 30,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks and then to a pipeline.  The EP mix is then sent out by pipeline.\n\n\n\nTwo flammable mixtures are reported as present at the facility in greater than threshold quantities. They are Butane+ (Butane and heavier hydrocarbons) and Natural Gas Liquids (or demethanized raw feed). There are no toxic substances present at this plant.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Longview Gas Plant has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accident over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\nWe provided manual emergency shu"

We also provided dual seals on the hot oil pumps.\n\n\n\nWe provided high-pressure and low-pressure shutdown switches on our E-P Mix and butane product pipelines.\n\n\n\nWe provided fire extinguishers throughout the facility for extinguishing incipient fires.\n\n\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in December 2001.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Longview Gas Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Longview Gas Plant with the Elderville Volunteer Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Longview Fire Department, the Lakeport Police Department, the Gregg County Sheriff, the Good Shepherd Hospital, and the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n\n\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\nAn ongoing dialogue with the Gregg County LEPC Chairman will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.\n\n\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the Gregg County LEPC Chairman for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
