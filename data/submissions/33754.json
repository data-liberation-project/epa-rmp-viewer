The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the spring and summer months.  The plant produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios in the RMP, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The Seward Fisheries facility has been operating safely since 1973.  The facility recently completed measuring the actual quantity of ammonia in the system, resulting in a significantly lower quantity value than had been originally estimated.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP and must consist of the failure of the largest vessel in the system.  This release is modeled using RMP*Comp? software. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario \nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan.  To obtain the most conservative assumption, no mitigation is considered in the scenario calculations.  This release is modeled using RMP*Comp? software. \n\nRelease Prevention Program \nSeward Fisheries has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which is designed to prevent accidental releases o"

      "SummaryText": "f ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves. The plant has recently installed programmable logics control capabilities and integrated area monitoring.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nSeward Fisheries maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM plan to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response plan with local authorities and responders and conducts drills periodically to practice responses."
