This water treatment plant (8.24 MGD) is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program # 3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Humacao Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant is observing the appropriated engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nHumacao Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant is located close to the Atlantic Ocean where the plant discharges the treated water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans and contamination of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center at Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Humacao Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant could has a  maximum storage capacity of 20,000 pounds distributed in ten (10) containers.  Two containers are connected to chlorinators, only from one is in used at the time. The chlorine flow to the vacuum chlorinator and from it the chlorine is sent to the contact chamber, through a pipeline, where it is combined with the wa"

This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 3.0 miles (for rural areas), of a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Marplot EPA Simulator and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 28,152 public receptors are inside the 3.0 miles radio, which includes schools and industrial areas.  There is an environmental receptor beside the beach (wetland, Humacao Natural Reserve) that is located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a 3/8 inch pipe leak.  In such case the end point distance is calculated as 0.2 miles (for rural areas) and no public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlo"

List of all SOPs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the gas chlorine and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\n\n\nFive years Accident History:\n\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported during the last five years. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPRASA has implemented safety measures at Humacao Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.  In August 2013 the crane was replaced considering the equipment life in order to improve safety of the chlorine handling and storage. PRASA revised the operational procedures and will be training the operational personnel to improve safety practices and create more confidence in the management of the chlorine processes.  "
