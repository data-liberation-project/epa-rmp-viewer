The Lewisburg Water Treatment plant (LWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The LWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Action Plan requirements.\r\n\r\nB. The LWTP treatment system has been installed to disinfect the flow into the Lewisburg Water System. Chlorine is stored onsite and used in the disinfection process. The facility is monitored eight (8) hours daily by on site personnel and by SCADA monitoring 24 hours, 7 days a week.\r\n\r\nC. The general LWTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n     -High level of training of the operators\r\n     -Preventative maintenance programs\r\n     -Use of state-of-the- art process and safety equipment\r\n     -Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\r\n     -Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\r\n     -Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n     \r\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the  hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, as well as proper training of onsite personnel in case of  release.\r\n   \r\nD. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nE. The facility has an emergency response program coordinated with LEPC, Fire Department, and Police Department depending upon the  of the leak, weather conditions, wind speeds and direction. If advanced level of technical assistance is deemed necessary to control leak, Chemtrec may be called to give advice and assistance via 24 hour emergency"

A mock emergency response drill for chlorine loss has been conducted on site, where current response and emergency operations were utilized.\r\n\r\nF. We have in place a chlorine emergency action and process safety management plan. Mock emergency drills proved the plan in place was efficient and thorough. Planned changes to improve safety include expansion of SOP and Maintenance training programs."
