              "Description": "Prevention Program\n\nAnheuser-Busch has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases.  Designed to reduce both the likelihood and severity of releases of ammonia, this program integrates technology, procedures,  management practices, and years of operator experience.  This prevention program ensures that safe design principles and practices are followed for the brewery ammonia system and related projects by properly managing change to the system, as well as ensuring proper operation, maintenance and control of hazards.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe brewery has compiled information on the hazards of ammonia, the design basis for the refrigeration system and the specific equipment to help identify and understand the inherent hazards of ammonia and help in the safe operation of the system.  This information consists of:\n\nmaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs)\nprocess flow diagram\nstandard operating procedures (SOPs)\nSARA reports\nequipment drawings and specifications\ndesign and construction codes and standards compliance\nlist of process safety relief valves that shows location, design basis and capacity\nmanufacturer's equipment operating instructions\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAn initial process hazard analysis was conducted at the brewery in July, 1993, in the form of a Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP).  Process Hazard Analysis database and shows equipment and operations, potential deviations and their causes, consequences and recommended actions that were part of the HAZOP analysis.\n\nPotential hazards associated with the ammonia system that were evaluated in detail as part of the analysis are listed below.\n\nabnormal operation\naccessibility\nimpaired body movement\nclarity of instructions\nloss of containment\ncontamination\ncorrosion\naccuracy of drawings\nhigh/low/no/reverse flow\nhigh/low/no level\nhigh/low/no pressure\nhigh/low temperature\ninstrumentation issues\nfrequency/lack of information\nleakage\nequipment failure\nmaintenance\nlack of/too much/wrong action\nrelief valve discharges\nutilities failures\nvacuum\nvisibility\nwrong component\nwrong sequence\nnatural disasters (tornado, hurricane, earthquake)\n\nA system is in place to address the findings and recommendations resulting from the hazard analyses.  This system is driven by a risk matrix.  The status of the findings and action items are tracked in the previously mentioned database.\n\nProcess Controls\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has the following process controls:\n\n-monitoring by Utility operating personnel 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n-relief valves that relieve vessel pressure at a specified setpoint and reseat at pressures below the setpoint.  Many of these valves relieve back into the system, thus preventing a release to atmosphere.\n-burst disc indicators on some pressure relief valves that vent to atmosphere.  These burst disc indicators, upon rupture, immediately signal the Utilities central control room.\n-check valves that prevent backflow in piping\n-a water scrubber that absorbs ammonia prior to venting to atmosphere during system pumpouts\n-manual shutoff valves\n-interlocks that prevent activation of equipment under certain conditions\n-warning alarms and procedures that activate in the event of process upsets\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nProper operation of the refrigeration system minimizes the likelihood of errors that could lead to an accidental release of ammonia.  Clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices ensure safe operation of the system during all phases of operation, including startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and emergency operation, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  Operating procedures provide all employees involved with the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system with the written information and precautions necessary to safely perform their tasks in a consistent manner.  These procedures were last reviewed in December of 2003.\n\nOperator Training\n\nAll employees who operate, maintain and supervise the ammonia refrigeration system are trained and qualified to ensure proper, safe operation .  Employees also receive on-the-job training.\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION FOR ORIGINAL OR NEW EQUIPMENT, VALVES AND PIPING\n\nAssuring the mechanical integrity of a new system or new addition to an existing system are engineering and maintenance responsibilities. The following items relate to documented procedures used by Anheuser-Busch engineering and maintenance to assure mechanical integrity:\n\nEquipment Identification\nAll major pieces of equipment are initially assigned an equipment number.  This number also identifies equipment on Anheuser-Busch engineering drawings and in design premise documents for the ammonia refrigeration system hereafter referred to in this document as \"the system\". \n\nEquipment Design Criteria\nA design premise document is prepared for each major piece of equipment that has been assigned an equipment number.  The design premise provides the original design details, governing codes and specifications for the equipment.  A copy of the design premise is normally kept on file with plant engineering.\n\nEquipment Shop Drawings\nOn file with Plant Engineering or Utilities are manufacturer's shop drawings, approved by Anheuser-Busch engineering and filed by equipment number.  These approved drawings offer certification that the equipment item was fabricated in accordance with design specifications.  Details pertinent to the mechanical integrity of the system such as equipment dimensions, mass/energy balance, materials of construction, code requirements, pressure/temperature limits, special construction and installation instructions, etc. are normally noted on these shop drawings.\n\nOther Related Equipment\nOther technical provisions, (TP-60) for piping specifications, (TP-67) for electrical specifications, (TP-68) for instrumentation specifications, and (TP-59) for mechanical equipment installation, are also provided by engineering.  The technical provision documents are for use in purchasing, installing and testing piping systems to assure the mechanical integrity of the system.  Plant Engineering applies the same technical provisions, where applicable, for any system modifications, maintenance and repairs implemented at the plant level.\n\n\nPROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION FOR MAINTENANCE OF MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the system includes the following procedures:\n\n-training of operators and maintenance personnel in awareness of system deviations that jeopardize the mechanical integrity of the system\n-daily inspections and testing of the system by shift operators\n-use of computerized programming to issue and document repetitive work orders for routine inspections, testing, and maintenance of major equipment and piping\n-use of joint, periodic, inspections by Plant Engineering and insurance underwriter\n-implementation of special guidelines for safety valve and control device inspection, testing, and replacement\n-a policy on system spare parts and material\n\nOperator and Maintenance Personnel Training\nOne of the most important elements involved in an on-going mechanical integrity program is a knowledgeable, well-trained work force of system operators and maintenance personnel.  Towards that end, extensive training on basic refrigeration procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program was completed in 1995.  Training sessions on specific ammonia system standard operating procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program were completed in 1995.  Refresher training is performed every three years and was last completed in 2002.\n\nInspection and Testing of Pressure Relief Valves\nPressure relief valves are set up on a computer documented identification, inspection and testing program. This program requires quarterly, annual, and five year inspections and testing.\n\nSensors, Alarms and Safety Interlocks\nThe following devices are identified by an equipment number or listed on the repetitive work order for the major piece of equipment on which they are mounted.  If not covered by a special maintenance program, the following category of equipment or device is to be inspected annually as a minimum, or more frequently as recommended by the manufacturer or as determined by good engineering practices:\n\ncellar ammonia alarms\nsuction traps\n- level switches\n- alarms\n- liquid pumps\n-pressure transmitters\ncompressor cutouts and alarms\n- high discharge pressure\n- high discharge temperature\n- how suction. pressure\n- low oil pressure\n- high oil temperature\n- cooling water flow/ temperature /level switch(s)\nevaporator accumulators\n- liquid level control\n- high refrigerant level switch\n\nSpare Parts and Materials Policy\nSpare parts for system equipment and controls are to be original equipment manufacturer's parts. Any exception must meet industry standards and be approved by plant engineering.  Parts suppliers are to be documented on spare parts order forms.  The purchase and use of other materials such as valves and piping must meet the specifications in the latest corporate engineering technical provisions covering the material. (see previously explained, \"TP\" documentation).\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe brewery has in place a formal system to identify, assess,  authorize, and implement changes that may affect  the ammonia refrigeration system.  Prior to making a change in equipment or operation, an appropriate analysis must be completed and authorized.  In addition to this formal system, two management system components were developed, in part, in an effort to ensure that changes that may affect the ammonia refrigeration system are identified, assessed, and authorized.  The two management systems are called Capital Project and Process Change Review and Chemical Material Management Review.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nThis procedure ensures that a new system, or a significant modification to an existing system, is ready to operate safely.  The actions required are done before start-up (introduction of ammonia into the system for operational purposes).  They constitute a \"final check\" that the system is safe to place into service.\n\nThe Pre-Startup Safety Review follows Management of Change as the logical next step.  Management of Change asks, \"Is what you intend to do at least as safe as the rest of the system?\".  Pre-Startup Safety Review asks, \"Did you build it the way you intended to?\"\n\nSeveral of the actions of a Pre-Startup Safety Review are confirmation that other sections of the prevention plan have been accomplished.  In this way, Pre-Startup Safety Review is integrated into the whole of the management system.",

The following elements have produced this safe operating record:\n\nProcess hazard analysis and review, including identification of corrective actions which are tracked to closure;\nStandard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\nFormal operator training (80 hours minimum);\nPreventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\nProcedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so that system operation remains safe;\nSafety review prior to the startup of new or modified equipment;\nAudits of the PSM and RMP programs;\nIncident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents;\nEmployee involvement in risk reduction programs;\nContractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure outside workers exercise the same safety consciousness as brewery employees;\nA hot work permit system that ensures all welding work is conducted safely.\nProcess safety information; and \nEmergency planning and response.\n \nThe brewery additionally complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard (40 CFR 1910.119), the EPA RMP rules (40 CFR 68), and the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n  \nThe brewery has had no covered releases that have caused on-site or offsite injuries, or damage to property or the environment within the last five years. \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nThe St. Louis brewery has established emergency response procedures in the event of an incident involving ammonia.  The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120 (q)).  We have trained employees for emergency"

      "SummaryText": " response and maintain a plan entitled  \"Environmental, Health and Safety Incident Plan\" (EHSIP) which is provided to the City of St. Louis Fire Department.  We conduct periodic drills with local agencies as one of the methods we use to train on implementation of the EHSIP at the brewery. \n \nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.  Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified.  If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n \nAnheuser-Busch?s St. Louis brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety.  In 1996 a new state-of-the-art refrigeration plant was placed into service.  Additional changes to improve safety are planned in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations.  We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors.  Although we are confident the ?worst case? and ?alternative? scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely,  we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur.  Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety.  Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
