By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Shell - Sewaren Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Sewaren Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe Sewaren Terminal has variable inventories of butane. The Butane Railcar Offloading, Tank Blending, and Truck Loading/Unloading System provides the Sewaren Terminal the capability to offload butane from railcars and trucks and blend the butane into gasoline tanks. In addition, it also allows for the direct transfer of butane from railcars to tanker trucks. The system consists of one (1) truck loading/offloading rack with three (3) bays, one (1) rail spur holding up to nine (9) butane railcars with two (2) rail offloading locations, one (1) air-eliminator, one (1) vapor removal pump, and associated piping and appurtenances. Butane can be offloaded from either tanker trucks at the three (3) loading rack bays or from railcars at the two (2) railcar offloading locations. The butane is then transferred to one of twelve above-ground, floating roof storage tanks for blending with gasoline. The System also provides the Sewaren Terminal the capability to transfer butane from railcars directly into tanker trucks. Truck loading can occur at Loading Rack Bays 2 and 3.
