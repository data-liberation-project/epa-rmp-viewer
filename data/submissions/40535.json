The Grayson Power Plant is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Section Safety Supervisors are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the Plant. In addition, the Power Plant has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facility. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothesize potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe chlorine systems for  the Grayson Power Plant of City of Glendale Water and Power are located at 634 Bekins Way, Glendale, California 91201.  The chlorine systems for the Grayson Power Plant consist of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a one ton container through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the treatment processes.  \n\nA maximum of 5 one ton chlorine containers (10,000 lbs) are maintained at the Grayson Power Plant: one (2,000 lbs) at the No. 1 Chlorine House and four (8,000 lbs) at  the No. 2 Chlorine House. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCity of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.

There was a near miss on May 7, 2004 that involved the chlorine delivery vendor. During a delivery, the chlorine vendor did not follow his procedure and a one ton container rolled off the truck. No chlorine was released and no one was injured. The incident investigation team reviewed the incident and consulted with all applicable employees regarding the delivery vendor's procedures. The delivery vendor was also notified of the incident.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)
