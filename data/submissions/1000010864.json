The Facility Policy\n\nCoop Association #2 and the employees of the Coop Association #2 Bulk Plant in Washington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Washington Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nThe facility has one, 30,000 gallon storage tank seventeen, 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, one 1,200 gallon nurse tank, four 560 gallon tank applicators and two 400 gallon tank applicators. The maximum amount handled at one time would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere was a release on 10/08/2004 of 5,608 pounds. The release was the result of a valve left open during the attempted theft of anhydrous ammonia.  Seven people were evacuated, but no injuries or deaths occurred. Minor vegetation damage resulted to the northwest of the storage tank.\n\n5.

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n    "
