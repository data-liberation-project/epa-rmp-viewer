The controls involve process design, equipment installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.\n\nCDC?s emergency response policy is to maintain an emergency response plan and team capable of responding to and minimizing the effects of any chemical emergency that might occur at the facility.\n\nCDC is a custom batch manufacturer of a wide variety of specialty organic chemicals for use by the agricultural, electronics, coatings and other industries worldwide.  CDC has 11 major buildings located on a 39-acre site.   \n\nCDC operates processes containing chlorine, phosphorous oxychloride, and hydrazine  in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities.  Because of the variable production scheduling inherent in custom batch manufacturing, any or all of these processes may not actually be present on-site at any given time.\n\nIn a worst case scenario accident, all the chlorine contained in a cylinder could be released.  Based on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp computer program, such an accidental release could extend downwind far enough to affect off-site persons or the environment.\n\nAn alternative chlorine release scenario that would be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario could consist of a leak from a small hole in a chlorine cylinder or its valve.  Based on EPA's RMP*Comp computer program, such a release would not extend downwind far enough to affect off-site receptors.\n\nAn alternative phosphorous oxychloride release scenario that would be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario could consist of a leak from a small hole in the side of a phosphorous oxychloride drum.

CDC complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulations that include many requirements intended to prevent releases.  CDC?s general accidental release prevention program consists of the following practices:\n\n1.   Hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) or\" What If?\" reviews are conducted for all new processes\n2.   Written operating procedures are used for all processes\n3.   Employees are trained on new or changed processes and equipment\n4.   Contractors are informed of hazards and required to follow plant safety rules\n5.   Safe work practices are used, including lockout/tagout, confined space entry permits, line opening   permits, hot work permits, and contractor work permits\n6.   Process or equipment changes require prior safety review and pre-startup inspection\n7.   Process equipment is inspected, tested and maintained to insure mechanical integrity\n8.   All incidents are investigated so that measures to prevent recurrence can be implemented\n9.   The site is equipped with extensive fire protection equipment\n10.  The site has a written emergency plan, emergency communications and equipment, and  access to the services of employee, contractor and state hazardous material emergency responders\n11.

No flammable or combustible materials are stored or located near the chlorine cylinders.  The chlorine buildings are constructed of steel, are thermally insulated and are kept closed during chlorine usage.  The storage areas and evaporator buildings are protected from vehicle collisions by concrete-filled metal posts.  The chlorine is stored in DOT-approved steel cylinders.  The cylinders are leak-tested and inspected by the supplier before they are filled.  Respirators are worn by employees while connecting or disconnecting cylinders.  Chlorine cylinder patching and repair kits are readily available on-site.  Employee members of CDC's emergency response team are trained on the use of the kits.  Self-contained breathing apparatus, fully encapsulating suits and portable chlorine detectors are readily available for emergency use by employees responding to a chlorine leak.
