      "SummaryText": "THE LUBRIZOL CORPORATION - BAYPORT PLANT, PASADENA, TX.  77507\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lubrizol Corporation is committed to improving the safety of our products and processes. As part of Lubrizol?s philosophy, we believe in maintaining the health and safety of our employees, customers and neighbors and in protecting the environment. \n\nLubrizol?s attention begins very early in the life of a product with their New Chemical Introduction Process (NCIP) that evaluates and manages all aspects of new chemical introduction from inception to production. A second process, New Chemical Issues Assessment (NCIA), ensures that pollution prevention, inherent safety, and product stewardship consideration are addressed starting at invention and continuing through development.  A Process Hazard Analysis is performed on all expansions or modifications to a manufacturing process with sufficient risk before being put into service, even if they are not covered under OSHA PSM or EPA RMP. \n\nWe emphasize prevention of incidents, however, we have a very proactive Emergency Preparedness Program. We have emergency response teams in the plant 24 hours a day. The plant has more than  50 people trained in emergency response and a staff of over ninety people who are on an emergency  response paging system.  Emergency response personnel at Lubrizol?s Bayport facility receive more than 3,500 hours of training annually. In addition, Lubrizol is a active member of Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA), the largest chemical plant mutual aide organization in the world, in the event assistance from neighboring chemical plants should be required. We work closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC). We  are also active members of the American Chemical Council's Responsible Care program.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substa"

The plant is staffed by more than 100 full-time Lubrizol employees and more than 30 contractors. Each year the plant is recognized for community involvement in such areas as Partners in Education, Junior Achievement, Texas Scholars,  D.A.R.E., Boy Scouts,Girl Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Boys and Girls Harbor, and various charitable events. \n\nThe Lubrizol Bayport plant manufactures specialty chemical additives for lubricating oils used in gasoline and diesel engines, automatic transmissions, gear drives, marine engines and two stroke engine oils.  It also manufactures specialty chemicals used in fiber dyes, water treatment chemicals and personal care products.  The RMP regulated chemicals for the facility include 2-Methylpropene, Oleum, Acrylonitrile and Hydrazine.  Since our original RMP submission in 1999, the Bayport facility has reduced storage of Boron Trifluoride to reduce risk and amounts on-site are now less than RMP threshold quantities.  Lubrizol is always looking for ways to reduce the inventory of covered chemicals or substitute a less hazardous reactant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific-Prevention Steps\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLubrizol?s Bayport Plant emphasizes prevention of incidents while maintaining an exceptional emergency response program, cooperation with its neighboring chemical plants through Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA) and open dialog with the community through participation in the La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Community Advisory Council (CAC).\n\nOur accidental release prevention program starts with hazard identification and risk minimization by our corporate "

In addition to following the requirements of the OSHA PSM regulation requirements for PHAs, the plant has extended  the use of PHAs beyond those requirements to include non-covered processes. \n\nFor new facilities or modifications, the Bayport plant uses generally accepted industry standards and practices. In addition, the plant has developed a multi-disciplinary set of Texas Standards for engineering, design, and construction standards and practices to be followed when industry standards and practices are not available. \n\nTo ensure that any new facility or facility modification is constructed according to good standards and practices the plant has a contractor qualification program. All contractor craftsmen must receive training from the Houston Area Contractors Safety Council (HACSC). Part of the training received at the HACSC is site specific to the Lubrizol facility. \n\nHot Work Permits are required before welding, brazing, or any other activity that could generate a source of ignition. The Hot Work Permit documents that fire prevention and protection have been considered prior to beginning hot work. A key component of the Hot Work Permit is the requirement to have a ?Face to Face? meeting at the work site between the craftsman doing the work and the operator representative authorizing the work. Permits are required for any type of work, including ?Confined Space Entry?, Line Breaking? or just ?General Work?.\n\nBefore a new or modified facility is put into operation a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is conducted. The PSSR is a  review by a multi-disciplinary team to confirm that the equipment is in accordance with design specifications and that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place.\n\nOperating procedures have been written for all of our processes, and they identify safe oper"

In addition, operating personnel receive training on the safe operation of their processes and are trained on process modifications as they occur as part of the Management of Change process. \n\nThere are also some prevention programs that focus on keeping an existing operating process safe as changes are made. The Lubrizol Bayport plant follows a formal Management of Change (MOC) procedure. The purpose of the MOC procedure is to assure that the technical basis of the change is understood and that the impact of safety and health is considered prior to the change.\n\nInspection and testing of existing pipe and equipment is a key part of the plant's \"Mechanical Integrity\" program. Piping and equipment are periodically inspected or tested to assure that they meet the design specifications. If deterioration is detected, the piping or piece of equipment is repaired or replaced. This program identifies potential failures before they occur and is a very important part of operating the plant safely.\n\nThe Lubrizol Bayport plant has a very active PSM Compliance Audit Program. The purpose of the audit is to make sure that all of the prevention programs are working and to provide a tool to stimulate improvement. A procedure has been established to audit the entire plant once a year, and to conduct an audit on a different process unit each quarter. In addition, a more rigorous audit of all program elements is performed at least every 3 years, often by a knowledgeable outside third party to examine our process with new eyes.\n\nAn employee safety program that we feel is very effective in reducing risk is called Safety Through Employee Participation (STEP). This is a voluntary observation and feed-back program. Approximately 90% of our employees have elected to participate. The STEP program identifies many near misses. Plant safety teams will then discuss and "

There is a heavy emphasis on near miss investigations to prevent safety problems from occurring.\n\n2-Methylpropene is one of the Bayport plant?s RMP covered chemicals. In addition to the protection layers and programs listed above, this unit has a fugitive emissions monitoring program to check for leaks.  Fugitive emissions checks are conducted every three months. If leaks are detected they are repaired. Also, we have strategically placed flammable gas detectors with alarms to detect leaks should they occur. Because this material is flammable, the storage tanks and rail car area are covered with sprinkler systems to provide fire protection. There are also fire water curtains to assist in isolating the storage tanks from the rest of the plant in the event a release should occur. This unit is also equipped with a flare that can be used to flare off (burn) excess material should an upset condition occur.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere have been no releases of EPA covered chemicals at Lubrizol?s Bayport  plant in the past  five years that have had an adverse impact on the community or that would meet the EPA requirements for reporting.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant alarm system activates the Emergency Response Team to mitigate the incident.  Security, through our alpha-numeric paging system, immediately sends out information to be provided to the public through our local LEPC, and uses our hotline to advise our immediate neighbors.  Training is provided throughout the year on various aspects of our Emergency Response Program, and drills are conducted on-site, with our mutual aid organization, and our local LEPC.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn an effort to improve safety for employees, neighbors, and the surrounding com"

Previously, Boron Trifluoride storage had been the source of the site's \"Worst Case Scenario\".\n\nThe Lubrizol Bayport Plant will enter the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in late 2004 and hopes to become a \"STAR\" facility.  VPP Star facilities represent the \"best of the best\" in safety & health, with injury rates below industry average and proven programs that work.\n\nBeyond VPP, The Lubrizol Corporation has developed ?Safety Excellence?, a code of 17 management practices designed to make Lubrizol a leader in safety & health performance. Each practice was identified by benchmarking with 11 world class safety and health performers.  Safety Excellence  will be fully integrated with the Responsible Care Code of Management Practices. Practices will feature specific criteria, levels of performance that reflect the sophistication of process implementation, suggested measurements, and auditing requirements. The Lubrizol Safety & Health Safety Excellence process is a corporate wide initiative that will progressively move innovative safety & health practices into all Lubrizol operations including the Bayport plant."
