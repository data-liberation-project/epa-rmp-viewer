      "SummaryText": "Bowater Coated and Specialty Paper Division (Bowater) operates a pulp and paper mill in Catawba, South Carolina.  The address is 5300 Cureton Ferry Road, Catawba, South Carolina, 29704-0007.  The mill is located in York County.  This plant has approximately 1,125 full-time employees.  Bowater Incorporated located at 55 East Camperdown Way, Greenville, South Carolina, 29602 is the owner/operator of this plant.\n\nBowater submitted the original Risk Management Plan (RMP) in June of 1999.  The original RMP included three regulated chemicals in four covered processes.  Since 1999, Bowater has successfully eliminated two RMP covered chemicals from three RMP covered processes.  Sulfur dioxide was eliminated from use in the thermo-mechanical pulping system in 1999, and elemental chlorine was discontinued as a water treatment chemical during 2003.  In September 2003, Bowater began operating a new state-of-the-art kraft pulping system, which reduced overall chemical usage, and eliminated elemental chlorine from the paper manufacturing process.\n\nThe remaining RMP covered chemical at the Bowater mill is chlorine dioxide, which is used to brighten pulp from the kraft manufacturing process.  Chlorine dioxide is also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations under 29 CFR 1910.119 for Process Safety Management (PSM).  The PSM regulations are applicable based on Bowater?s storage of greater than 1,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  The OSHA regulations require the regulated process to undergo a process hazards analysis (PHA) and it must meet all of the other management requirements of the regulations.  Bowater has completed and implemented the PSM program Chlorine Dioxide.\n\nA facility is covered by the RMP rule if it has in inventory a regulated chemical in greater than the threshold quantity.  For chlorine dioxide, the level is 1,000 pounds.  Therefore, Bowater is also regulated by the RMP regulations.  Since the OSHA PSM progr"

      "SummaryText": "am is incorporated into the RMP regulations, the discussion below includes PSM concerns.\n\nThe U.S. EPA has established three levels of compliance to assure that individual processes are subject to requirements that match their location, complexity and the risk they pose.\n\n? Program 1 - requirements apply to processes for which a worst-case release would not affect the public.\n\n? Program 2 - applies to operators with only moderate complexity such as retailers, propane distributors and users, and others not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration - Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\n? Program 3 - requirements apply to higher-risk, complex chemical processing operations identified by certain Standard Industrial Codes (SIC), and to processes already subject to OSHA PSM.\n\nThe Bowater facility, being subject to the OSHA PSM standard for chlorine dioxide falls into the RMP Program 3 category.  An outline of Program 3 has the following major elements:\n\nA) Hazard Review\n     1) Worst-case Analyses\n     2) Alternative Release Analysis\n     3) 5-year Accident History\n     4) Develop and Implement a Management System\n\nB) Prevention Program\n     1) OSHA PSM Program\n\nC) Develop and Implement an Emergency Response Program\n\nD) Risk Management Plan Submittal\n     1) Executive Summary\n     2) Registration\n     3) Worst Case Analyses\n     4) Alternative Release Scenarios\n     5) 5-year Accident History\n     6) Prevention/Response Program Data\n     7)Certification\n\nThe RMP regulations require Bowater to provide information to the community on these chemicals, and conduct analyses of the effects these chemicals could potentially have on the surrounding environment, in the event of an accidental release.  Bowater has performed this required analysis, however, due to potential security concerns, the reporting requirements are being changed and they are not included in this executive summary. \n\nBowater is also subject to EPCRA 302 requirements and the"

The local fire department performed the last safety inspection at this plant on April 22, 2001.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require Bowater to revise the RMP within six-months of a change requiring a process hazard analysis or hazard review.  The regulations also require updating the RMP every five-years.  In September 2003, Bowater started a new kraft pulping process which required a new process hazard analysis.  Bowater is resubmitting the entire updated RMP at this time, fulfilling both the six-month revision and the five-year update and resubmission requirement.  The next five year update and resubmission of the RMP will be due in late February 2009.\n\nThe U.S.EPA has proposed several revisions to the RMP regulations that have not been finalized at the time of this submittal.  These requirements will be incorporated into this RMP submittal as a correction after the changes are finalized, and the submission software has been updated accordingly by U.S.EPA."
