A bleed line is available during portable tank filling. A second bleed line is also available to purge residual sulfur dioxide within the transfer lines before hoses are disconnected. These bleed lines are connected to a scrubber system which is continuously fed water.  Since sulfur dioxide is soluble in the water (forming sulfurous acid), no emissions are produced. Clean water passes through the scrubber continuously, thus, the water discharged to drain doesn\u2019t become over saturated with sulfur dioxide and a highly corrosive acid is not produced.\n\nSulfur dioxide from a one-ton cylinder is injected into the must line containing juice to inhibit fermentation.  The feed rate is controlled by a mass flow meter and metering pump. Sulfur dioxide is soluble in water and juice, so no emissions are produced. The quantity of sulfur dioxide added is determined by the wine maker. The metering pump is interlocked with the must pump such that sulfur dioxide is only added when the must pump is on.\n\nSulfur dioxide gas is also used to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in full and empty barrels in the Barrel Room. Sulfur dioxide is injected from a 6 lb. dispenser into the head space of barrels before and after they are filled with wine for aging.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or sulfur dioxide in annual safety meetings.

      "SummaryText": "ture control.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle operates on the principle of the latent heat of vaporization and the transfer/absorption of heat that occurs as a result. The compressors provide high-temperature, high-pressure vapor as ammonia vapor is compressed. Next, the evaporative condensers remove the heat of compression generated when the ammonia vapor is compressed.\nThe result of evaporative condensing is a high-pressure liquid, which drains to the receiver and is made available for cooling via control valves to other parts of the system. As cooling is required in chillers or wine tank jackets, the liquid is metered and pumped from the suction accumulators. As the liquid ammonia passes through the cooling coils or chillers, it absorbs heat from the wine and subsequently expands and vaporizes as the pressure of the ammonia drops.\n\nThe resulting liquid/vapor mixture is returned from the chillers to the accumulators, where the liquid and vapor are separated to protect the compressors from liquid slugging. Ammonia vapor is returned to the compressors to repeat the cycle and accumulated liquid ammonia at the bottom of the vessel supplies the pumps.  \n\n1.2.2 Sulfur Dioxide Process Description\n\nSulfur dioxide gas is added to wines and juices to prevent unwanted microbial activity. Sulfur dioxide is also used to protect the headspace (air space at the top of a vessel) of storage tanks and barrels.\n\nSulfur dioxide is transferred from one-ton cylinders to 1kg, 6 lb., 25 lb., and 100 lb. portable cylinders.  The portable cylinders are transported to the point of use for injection into fruit juice, pulp and/or skins to inhibit unwanted microbial activity.\n\nNo chemical reactions or special process temperatures need to be maintained. The process involves the simple transfer from a larger vessel to a smaller one. Plant nitrogen is connected and opened to the vapor valve of the one-ton cylinder to assist in the transfer of liquid sulfur dioxide. The amount (pounds) loaded into the ca"
