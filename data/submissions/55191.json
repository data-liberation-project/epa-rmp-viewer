These programs include both Arkema Chemical's Responsible CareA? requirements and governmental requirements, such as the EPA's RMP program and the CalARP RMP program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment.  Arkema management is committed to providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe facility is located at 19500 Mariner Avenue in the City of Torrance, California.  The facility is known as the Torrance Distribution Terminal (Terminal).  The activities conducted at the facility include the bulk storage, transfer, and blending of chemicals.  The Torrance terminal is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of a regulated substance above the threshold quantities listed in the RMP rule.  Currently, the only regulated substance present on-site in quantities above the threshold limit is vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).\nAnnual VAM throughput is approximately 43 million pounds.  VAM is received by tank rail cars and stored in one aboveground tank, Tank 26, dedicated for storage of VAM.  The facility is equipped to receive bulk VAM delivery by tank truck, but this method of receipt has not occurred in the past 5 years. The delivery truck method of receipt is an option in the event the facility can not receive VAM by rail. Tank 26 is described as follows:\n* Internal floating roof tank with double deck pontoon rim seals;\n* 265,000-gallon maximum capacity and 186,000-gallon operating capacity (using administrative controls);\n* Secondary containment with a capacity of over 350,000 gallons; and\n* Floating gauge for measuring liquid level.\nVAM is transferred from Tank 26 to the adjac"

The facility is equipped to distribute bulk shipments of VAM to customers by tank truck, but this method of distribution has not occurred in the past 5 years and there are no plans to utilize this method of distribution.  \nA network of product transfer piping is routed between the VAM storage, the truck loading station, and the adjacent UES latex plant.  All piping is coated to prevent corrosion and is supported by steel framework, or is securely fastened to concrete or asphalt platforms or foundations.  Underground sections of piping (two road crossings) are encased by an outer pipe to prevent corrosion and seismic damage.\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  EPA defines alternative release scenarios as scenarios that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  One or more alternative release scenarios are evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or active mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.\nThe zones of potential impact for the worst-case and alternative release were predicted using RMP*CompA? (Version 1.07) released by the EPA.  RMP*CompA? is an electronic tool to make the same calculations as performed manually by following the procedures described in EPAA?s guidance document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April, 1999).  \nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe RMP regulation requires consideration of the catastrophic failure of the largest storage vessel on the facility as the worst-case release scenario.

      "SummaryText": " large storage vessels for VAM on the facility: the 186,000 gallon VAM storage tank and the 30,000 railcar delivering VAM.  Both vessels were evaluated for the worst-case release scenario.  For VAM, at ambient temperature, the emission rate (and hence impact zone) will be proportional to the exposed liquid surface resulting from the vessel catastrophic failure, and not the tank volume.  There is no containment around a railcar on the siding and thus any release from the railcar would be uncontained.  The VAM storage tank has secondary containment that will limit the size of any VAM spill from the tank to less than that produced by an uncontained rail car spill.  Consequently the emission rate resulting from a catastrophic railcar failure will produce the worst-case off-site impact and was chosen as the worst-case release event.\nThe worst-case release scenario involves derailment of a railcar and subsequent release of the entire railcar contents.  A passive mitigation measure in place is coarse gravel along the rail spur.  The surface area of the resultant pool was estimated assuming a pool depth of 3 inches to reflect the reduction in horizontal extent of the pooled VAM due to percolation into the gravel.  The worst-case meteorological conditions defined by EPA for the worst-case release are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and a stability class of F (very stable).  The liquid is assumed to be at a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (A?F).  The distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is approximately 1.9 miles (3,100 meters).  Approximately 91,600 persons reside within the 1.9-mile worst-case impact radius.\nThe catastrophic failure of a railcar while on a siding is a very low probability event.  Over the ten year period 1991-2000, there were on average only 72 serious incidents per year in the United States in which hazardous material was released from a railcar during an incident or accident (U.S. DOT, Hazardous Materials Safety, Hazardous"

      "SummaryText": " Materials Information System, 1/23/02).  Most of these incidents involved derailments and other energetic events that have high potential for causing a release of hazardous material.  A slowly moving or static railcar on a siding is rarely exposed to the energetic forces required to produce a catastrophic breach of the rail car tank. Loading accidents such as a hose breakage or disconnect can occur but these events would produce a lower release rate than the assumed catastrophic failure of the entire rail car. \nThe more likely alternative-case release scenario consists of a valve leak in the piping leading to Tank 26 caused by an event such as a liquid hammer that damages the valve or a maintenance accident.  The release rate is 250 gallons per minute (gpm) based on the pump capacity and is assumed to continue for 10 minutes prior to shutoff.  The release is contained within the tankA?s concrete containment area.  The calculated endpoint distance for the alternative-case scenario is based on typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed and D atmospheric stability).  No active mitigation measures are assumed and dispersion is based on an urban environment.  The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.26 mg/l is approximately 0.4 miles (600 meters).  Approximately 900 persons reside within the 0.4-mile alternative-case release impact radius.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Terminal in Torrance, California.
