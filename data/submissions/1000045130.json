The Helena Chemical Company (HCC) Branch Manager implements the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program (RMPr) for this RMP covered process at this Facility and is assisted by other trained HCC staff as directed. The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.  \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1 (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Handling) equipment includes (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank and ancillary pump, piping, and valves, and (22) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.  \n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (HCC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at the Brunswick, NE Facility.  At this Facility, HCC engages in the agricultural chemical storage and handling, fertilizer blending, and technical support and distribution (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use HCC's products to support agricultural operations.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Brunswick Facility located at 52345 and Highway 20, Brunswick, NE 68720.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Brunswick Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Brunswick Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHCC is resubmitting this RMP as a 5-Year update.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 PSM/RMPr Facility have been addressed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at the Brunswick Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Brunswick Facility stores and handles one covered chemical (i.e. anhydrous ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA.  Two covered processes are operated at this Facility and they include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600- gallon) and then transferred to one (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nAt this Facility, anhydrous ammonia is either loaded out into nurse tanks for retail sale to the end user or is blended with water and phosphoric acid to make ammonium polyphosphate.  Ammonium polyphosphate is a liquid fertilizer that is used by farmers on a seasonal basis.  Covered process equipment used in this process includes a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck for the storage of the anhydrous ammonia and a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR).  The commercial tanker truck is owned by a Vendor/Contractor, and the MPR is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  When the IFRC arrives to the Facility, the Facility transfers the responsibility of the anhydrous ammonia in the commercial tanker truck to the IFRC.  At this point, the IFRC connects the commercial tanker truck to the MPR by transfer hoses and prepares to operate the MPR to blend the ammonium polyphosphate.  When the IFRC is complete with its operations, the IFRC transfers the responsibility for the anhydrous ammonia in the commercial tanker truck back to the Facility.  \n\n\n\nThe total quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility, assuming all vessels (i.e. 30,000-gallon storage tank, 22 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, and a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck) are filled to their administrative capacity, is 287,697 lbs.  However, the total aggregate reported in the EPA RMP Submit database is 382,973 lbs.  The reason for this is because the quantity stored in the 30,000-gallon storage tank is accounted for 2 times (i.e. once for the Storage and Handling and again for the Fertilizer Blending).\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage "

      "SummaryText": "process and the reacting process.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the ammonia storage and the reacting process because the largest vessel (i.e. a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank) is common to both of the covered processes when connected.  (Although the majority of the time, the IFRC connects its MPR to a commercial tanker truck, it is possible that the IFRC could connect its MPR to the 30,000-gallon storage tank.  Therefore, the largest vessel was selected for conservative purposes.)  The worst case scenario release for the Brunswick Facility was modeled as if the 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are the same for the two processes.  For the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 30-second release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  For the fertilizer blending process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 30-second release from a ruptured 3-inch liquid transfer hose during the blending process.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of these types is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (tri-pod pull away protection, bulkhead, back flow check valve, emergency shutoff valves, and excess flow valves) and operating procedures that the Facility and the IFRC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.

The RMP will be updated as the Brunswick Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes.
