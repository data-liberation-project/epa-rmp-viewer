In fulfilling this commitment, management systems are in place to provide the resources and training to maintain compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, ensuring that safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Accident prevention is emphasized through strict operating procedures, safe work practices, ongoing training and administrative and operational controls. While continually striving to prevent accidental releases, should one occur, the refinery maintains a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team for fast response and incident mitigation and control.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery Wilmington Plant, located in Wilmington, California, operates a variety of processes designed to take intermediate oil products from Tosco's Carson Plant and upgrade/modify them to produce a variety of refinery products including gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.  The refinery produces and/or uses regulated flammables including, propane, butane, hydrogen and mixtures of regulated flammable substances. In addition, the refinery uses both aqueous and anhydrous ammonia, both of which are regulated toxic substances, for pollution control. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the Wilmington Plant is a catastrophic failure in either of two anhydrous ammonia storage vessels located in different units, resulting in releases of ammonia gas over a 10-minute period. While the refinery has safeguards in place to prev"

The maximum distances to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for these WCSs would include offsite impact. Both scenarios are discussed, since the disparate relative source locations within the plant could potentially impact different offsite receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for anhydrous ammonia is a leaking relief valve, resulting in offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery.\n\nThe WCS associated with flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), resulting from the release of the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butane. Controls to prevent and/or mitigate such a release were not considered during this evaluation, therefore; the butane is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite into a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS would include offsite impact.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from a release of butane from a transfer line. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS includes offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery. \n  \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that follows the elements found in the OSHA PSM standard to prevent incidents from occurring. The following is a summary of these elements and a description of the management system that is in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation is regarded as essential to the continuous improvement of the LAR PSM program, and hence in the prevention of accidents.
