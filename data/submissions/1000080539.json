In addition, the largest unit is enclosed in a building.  Release of the entire amount of ammonia on plant site, which represents the worst-case scenario, would leave our plant site; however, no public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance.  Model used:  EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations.\r\n\r\n  - Epichlorohydrin - Failure of the storage tank filled with the largest amount possible would release the substance into a concrete dike that limits the exposed surface area of the liquid pool and thus reduces the release rate.  No public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance resulting from the worst case release.  Model used:  Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA).\r\n\r\n  - Oleum - Failure of the storage tank filled with the largest amount possible would release the substance into a concrete dike that limits the exposed surface area of the liquid pool and thus reduces the release rate.  Since no vapors would leave the plant site, no public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance.  Model used:  RMP*Comp version 1.07\r\n\r\n  - Phosgene - This material is used in a one-ton cylinder enclosed in a special room.  Failure of the cylinder would release the substance into the room.  A population of 418 would be affected by this release which consists only of residences with no schools, hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, office areas, or industrial areas in the impacted zone.  This cylinder could not catastrophically fail since it can withstand impact of a locomotive.  No environmental receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.

It would take a leak of 100 lbs. to impact any public receptors.  Van DeMark Chemical Company Inc. controls cylinder leaks through detailed mechanical integrity of these vessels.  A leak repair kit is maintained on the Martin plant site.  The plant's Fire and Emergency Brigade is trained in the use of this leak repair kit.  No leaks of this chemical have ever been experienced outside the manufacturing area.\r\n\r\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Martin plant complies with all EPA Regulations at 40 CFR Part 68; OSHA Regulations at 29 CFR 1910; Clean Water Act Regulations at 40 CFR 112; RCRA Regulations at 40 CFR 264, 265, & 279.52; and EPCRA Rules and Laws.  We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Leadership by senior management through policy, participation, communications, and resource commitments provide results in achieving continuous improvement of performance.\r\n\r\nAccident prevention programs are maintained through the Works Management Safety Committee, Works Employee Safety Committee, Works Management Inspection Committee, Process Safety Management Task Force, and the Executive Safety Review Committee.

Clear accountability for safety performance is part of each employee's annual review.\r\n\r\nUse of the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) process assures public comments and concerns are considered in both design and operation of the plant's process safety systems.  All elements of the EPA and PSM programs are used to ensure sufficient layers of protection exist through technology, facilities and personnel to prevent escalation from a single failure to a catastrophic event.\r\n\r\nAll plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs that they do.  Every employee has the authority to shutdown any process or to stop any job, in order to maintain a safe operation.  Training programs cover job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\r\n\r\nAll plant process equipment is subjected to EPA and OSHA mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.  All storage and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves.  Process shutdown systems are built-in to our process control computers. These safety devices and shutdown systems are periodically inspected and tested.  Predictive Maintenance techniques are utilized to address problems before they happen.  All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operator, maintenance, engineering, technical and management review.  \r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of a release, we feel the best method of protection for our community is to shelter in place away from the hazard.  We have prepared our community by publishing the steps they should take during a chemical release from our plant boundaries.\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems dictate the way we do business, and we have specific accountabili"
