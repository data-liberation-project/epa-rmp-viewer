Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\n\n\nCalifornia Resources Corporation (CRC) is strongly committed to employee and public safety, as well as sound environmental practices. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe CRC stationary source consists of as gas plant and NGL recovery which contains a flammable mixture.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the applicable accidental release prevention provisions of 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at CRC.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nCRC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the hazards of the chemicals used in the processes, information regarding the technology of the process, and detailed equipment information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nCRC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are\n\nidentified and appropriately managed. The primary methodologies used to conduct these analyses are Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and What-If studies. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner based on relative risk of potential hazards.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, CRC"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nCRC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes, as well as emergency activities. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCRC carries out documented inspections, tests, and maintenance checks of process equipment to ensure adequate mechanical integrity. These activities are conducted by the Mechanical Integrity and Maintenance groups. Only qualified personnel are permitted to carry out inspections, tests, and maintenance activities on process equipment and systems such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps, compressors and electrical equipment. Specialized training is provided as needed for certain maintenance checks. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are tracked to completion through the company maintenance work order system and corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA Management of Change program is in place at CRC to manage changes in process chemicals,\n\ntechnology, equipment, procedures, and personnel. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are\n\npromptly made aware of or, if needed, trained on the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of established processes are conducted whenever there is a change in the safety information as part of the Management o"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCRC conducts internal audits on a regular basis to verify compliance and effectiveness of the\n\nprevention program elements defined by the RMP rule. Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to completion through an appropriate action tracking system.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCRC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a\n\ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent future releases. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCRC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs).\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nCRC utilizes contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. CRC has a policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the surrounding processes. Contractors are also informed of procedures for emergency activities should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4.
