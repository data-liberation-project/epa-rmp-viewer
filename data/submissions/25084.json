      "SummaryText": "The Wheeler Ridge Transmission Station is a remote, automated, unmanned natural gas transmission compressor station owned by the Southern California Gas Company (\"The Gas Company\"). The NAICS code for the facility is 48621 - Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas.   There are no on-site employees.   The station's function is to compresses natural gas for transport through the Gas Company's transmission pipeline system.  Station facilities include a compressor building and three turbines, a selective catalytic reduction NOx control system using anhydrous ammonia,  aboveground storage tanks for anhydrous ammonia and odorant, a fire pump building, air cooled heat exchangers, a battery room building, an office, storage areas,  piping and associated equipment.\n\nThe Station is located approximately 1.5 miles west of Interstate 5 on California State Highway 166 in the southern San Joaquin Valley, or about 2.25 miles west of Mettler, California.   The land use in the vicinity of the facility is rural with relatively flat topography.  The capacity of the anhydrous ammonia tank is 35,000 pounds of ammonia liquefied under pressure.  The  RMP Threshold Quantity (TQ) is 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The Stations is therefore subject to the requirements of 40CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  \n\nA worst-case off-site consequent analysis (OCA) was performed using the U.S. EPA RMP*Comp model (version 2.0.2) assuming complete failure of the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The worst-case assumptions assumed included an ambient temperature of 77\u00baF,  very stable \"F\" stability conditions, a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, and evaporation of the entire tank contents in 10 minutes .  The distance to toxic endpoint, the distance at which the downwind concentration of ammonia falls to 200 ppm, is 3.1 miles for this worst-case analysis.  There are approximately 256 persons who reside within 3.1 miles of facility.  \n\nThe ammonia storage tank is inside a concrete containment struct"

Following EPA RMP guidance, the worst-case OCA did not take into account any reduction in impact due to operation of the water deluge system.\n\nThe complete failure of the storage tank is a highly improbable event.  A more realistic release scenario involves a hose rupture or leak during off-loading of ammonia from a tanker truck delivering ammonia to the site.  The  alternative OCA was performed assuming a release of 4,000 pounds of ammonia over 10 minutes.  The alternative OCA assumed an ambient temperature of 77\u00baF, neutral \"D\" stability conditions, a wind speed of 3.0  m/sec, and evaporation of the spilled ammonia over 10 minutes .  The distance to toxic endpoint for the alternative OCA  is 0.4 miles.  There are approximately 8 persons who reside within 0.4 miles of facility.   The alternative OCA did not take into account any reduction in impact due to operation of the water deluge system.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan and it is included in a written community emergency response plan.  The local agency with which the facility\u00bfs emergency response plan is coordinated is the Kern County Department of Environmental Health Services.  The facility is subject to EPCRA due to the on-site storage of odorant (the mercaptan tetrahydrothiophene)."
