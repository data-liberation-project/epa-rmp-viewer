Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWe at Sysco Central Illinois, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are coordinated with Logan County Emergency Management which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of products to many retail outlets.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\n3.  Hazard Assessment:\r\nSysco Central Illinois, Inc. analyses Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities.  Information pertaining to the off-site consequences is located within the Risk Management Program at our facility.\r\n\r\n 4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302"
