In response to the congressional mandate, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).\n\n     The RMP Rule identified covered facilities on the basis of use/storage of threshold quantities of any of a long list of chemicals (see 40 CFR Part 68.130, Table 1) and required those facilities to submit to EPA a completed RMP by June 21, 1999.  Further, the RMP Rule requires that all covered facilities must review all aspects of their respective plans and re-submit to EPA RMP updates every five years thereafter as long as a facility is covered by the Rule.\n\n\n\nFINDINGS (as of July,2009)\n\n     A third compliance audit and a hazard review was completed in July, 2009 for the City of Westwego's water treatment plant  as required by the RMP rule and the appropriate offsite consequence assessment (OCA) modeling was re-visited  done as well.  No significant problems were noted by those efforts.  The OCA continues to predict a very small impact area such that area residents/occupants should have little to no concern relative to the subject facility.\n\n     A dress rehearsal of the implementation of the Emergency Response Plan component of the subject facility's RMP is to be held upon completion of construction at WTP site to ensure that the first responders, e.g., local police and fire department personnel are properly trained and coordinated for first response conditions"
