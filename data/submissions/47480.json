The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nBaker Commodities maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Baker Commodities was completed in December 2001.  The facility is located at 4100 Bandini Boulevard, Vernon, California,  90023.  It is owned by Baker Commodities and is operated by Inland Cold Storage.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the 1997 Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 20,000 pounds of ammonia for storage freezers and dock operations.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Baker Commodities ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.

For example, the Baker Commodities facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\nThe Baker Commodities facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Baker Commodities facility within the last five years.  In addition, Inland Cold Storage, who will be operating the Baker facility, currently operates three other ammonia refrigerated warehouses and none have had an accidental release of ammonia in the last five years (December 2001 - December 2006).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Baker Commodities has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

Baker Commodities plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBaker Commodities is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
