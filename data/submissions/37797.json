This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ConAgra Foods (ConAgra) facility in Carthage, Missouri has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has an excellent and detailed preventative maintenance program.  More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan to ensure the safety of its employees.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release \u00bf HAZMAT Team. The Emergency Action Plan is a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the ConAgra facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ConAgra Carthage Plant kills, eviscerates, debones, and cooks whole turkeys. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311615.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the poultry products.  ConAgra has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process has not been officially calculated.  The current estimate based on purchases is 58,000 pounds.  The process uses more than the threshold quantity of 1"

Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenario for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario are reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.\tEye contact\n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nConAgra has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At ConAgra, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, ConAgra\u00bfs ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are being implemented for the RMP.  \n\nListed below are the key aspects of the ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia prevention program:\n\nThe Carthage plant uses a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for control scheduling and accomplishment of preventative maintenance on components of the refrigeration system.  The scope of preventative maintenance (PM) and testing/inspection (T/I) for refrigeration components is based on individual vendor recommendations and generally accepted engineering practices with regard to types of preventative maintenance and inspections and their recommended frequencies.  The plant has created work tasks for each type of PM and T/I associated with the refrigeration system.  These tasks are included on the individual work order generated by the CMMS.  This system ensures that each operator/mechanic is aware of the pertinent procedure.  The operator/mechanic and their supervisor sign off the completed work order.  Specific results of each PM and T/I procedure are recorded on the work order.  In the event a PM or T/I procedure is not completed satisfactorily, the operator/mechanic notes it on the work order, and a follow-up work order is generated to address the specific deficiency.\n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of ConAgra\u00bfs accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 \u00bf June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there has been one accidental release at this facility.\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ConAgra facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called Emergency Action Plan (EAP). \n\nConAgra\u00bfs EAP is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. All emergency response personnel (HAZMAT Team) undergo emergency response training.  For all emergencies, the plan activates the Incident Command Team and the HAZMAT Team.  These teams are responsible for implementing the EAP and controlling all aspects of th"
