The addition of more ammonia resulted in our inventory exceeding the 10,000 lb threshold.  At that time we developed and implemented a PSM / RMP program. \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Whole Foods is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP) Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 68 to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 6,784 lbs of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 10,600 lbs of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel distance before dispersing en"

This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n"
