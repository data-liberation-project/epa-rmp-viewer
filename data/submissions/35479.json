To accomplish this, management will provide all reasonable safe guards to ensure safe working conditions.  The joint cooperation of employees and management in the observation of this policy will provide safe working conditions and accident free performance, and will be to the mutual advantage of all.\nThe Jasper Water Treatment Plant is a Drinking Water Treatment Facility for the City of Wichita Falls.  Chlorine and Ammonia are both stored at the site for Disinfection.  The facility has mechanical equipment to detect and mitigate a gas release and all personnel utilize Standard Operating Procedures that are taught on-the-job and in formal training classes.\nThis facility has not experienced any accidents within the last 5 years.  This is attributed to the high level of training that the employees receive.  However, if an accident had occurred the facility would have utilized its backup response by activating the Fire Departments Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Team.\nBy providing our employees with proper training, the proper tools and the support needed, we are able to provide the public with the safety they require for maximum enjoyment of our community."
