              "Description": "All covered processes at Faustina are Level 3 since they are all covered by the PSM regulation.  Common PSM procedures are applicable to all processes, including employee participation plan for the facility, Management of Change, Incident Investigation and Hot Work permit procedures, common plant alarm system and emergency response systems, common contractor and maintenance programs, and compliance audits that review all covered processes.                                                                                           Operating and maintenance procedures, including training plans, have been rewritten to meet the needs of PSM and RMP standards. Employees served as subject matter experts in the development of the new procedures.  They also participate in annual procedure reviews and updates.                                                    HAZOP methology was used in conducting all PHAs in covered processes.     PHAs  were conducted as follows:  Ammonia and Ammonia Storage on 7/98; Urea Plant   on 9/98; Granulation Plants on 11/95; and chlorine processes on  8/94.                                 Process Specific Mitigation Measures:   The ammonia storage area has the dike.  The flare is applicable to the Ammonia Plant and Ammonia Storage processes.  Scrubbers are applicable to the Granulation Plant processes.",

Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe IMC-Agrico, Faustina Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in St. James Parish emergency drills, meetings with other companies and the St. James Parish emergency operations center, and meetings with the Ascension Parish emergency response organizations.\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n1)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public; \n2)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures; \n3)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; \n4)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n \nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\nIt is IMC-Agrico's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, IMC-Agrico trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  IMC-Agrico has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n\n2.

In the ammonia plant, a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air is used to manufacture anhydrous ammonia with carbon dioxide as a by-product.  Some of the anhydrous ammonia produced is then separated and stored for use in the granulation plants.  In the sulfuric acid plants, molten sulfur is burned with air in an enclosed vessel to produce sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide is then converted to sulfur trioxide and mixed with water to produce sulfuric acid.  In the Phosphoric Acid plant, sulfuric acid is reacted with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid.  In the granulation plants, phosphoric acid is reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce granular monoammonium phosphate and / or diammonium phosphate.  Chlorine is used for water treatment in the cooling towers associated with the sulfuric acid plants and the utilities area.\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in these processes include: anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide.  Anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are the only regulated toxic substances that exceed their threshold planning quantities at the Faustina facility.  As sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, they are not present in quantities in the process that exceed their applicable threshold planning quantities.  Regulated flammable substances involved in these processes that exceed threshold planning quantities include the flammable gas mixtures reacted and generated in the ammonia plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated storage tank surrounded by a dike.  In addition to the anhydrous ammonia manufactured in the facility's ammonia plant, the Faustina facility also receives anhydrous ammonia via an underground commercial pipeline, as well as by ship and barge at the facility's river dock on occasion.

Natural gas is received at the facility by an underground commercial pipeline which is connected by piping to the ammonia plant.\n\n\n3.    Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the Faustina Facility is a toxic release involving the loss of the entire contents of the refrigerated  anhydrous ammonia storage vessel over a period of ten minutes into the dike surrounding the tank. The pool of liquid ammonia spilled into the dike then evaporates based on parameters stipulated in the RMP regulations.  Calculations were based on information in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance document.  Those calculations established that the distance to the 0.14 mg/L toxic endpoint had offsite impacts.  However, this worst case release scenario is unlikely to occur based on the material properties of the liquefied anhydrous ammonia and the design of the refrigerated storage vessel.  A worst case scenario was also computed for a chlorine release, but the distance to the toxic endpoint was less than that for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe IMC-Agrico, Faustina facility has no worst case or alternative case release scenarios for regulated flammable substances in a covered process that have offsite consequences.  Calculations performed in accordance with information in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance document showed no scenarios that reached the offsite flammable endpoints of 1 psi overpressure for unconfined vapor cloud explosions, or radiant heat exposures of 50 kW/m2 for 40 seconds from fires involving accidental releases of these regulated flammable substances.\n\nA number of alternative release scenarios were evaluated at the Faustina facility for toxic releases of both anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  Most of these scenarios did not result in offsite impacts.  The alternative release scenario re"

Again, information in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis document was used to predict the distance to the 0.14 mg/L toxic endpoint.  Using the standard alternative case parameters in the RMP rule, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to have offsite impacts.  As no credit was taken for active and passive mitigation measures, local weather conditions, and the topography was chosen as rural terrain, this alternative release scenario is conservative.\n\nThe alternative release scenario resulting in the farthest distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine was a valve failure on a chlorine storage cylinder.  The criteria contained in Pamphlet 74, entitled \"Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release,\" from the Chlorine Institute was used to select the case.  The EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis document was used to predict the distance to the 0.0087 mg/L toxic endpoint.  Using the standard alternative case parameters in the RMP Rule, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to have offsite impacts.  As no credit was taken for active mitigation measures, local weather conditions and the topography was chosen as rural terrain, this alternative release scenario is conservative.\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, chlorine and flammable mixtures are regulated as a highly hazardous chemicals under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina facility, the Faustina facility is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and therefore, the Faustina facility satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP.

And has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in these processes.\n\nIMC-Agrico, Faustina facility also has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards through the use of process hazard analysis techniques.\n\nIMC-Agrico, Faustina facility periodically revalidates its process hazard analyses to incorporate regulatory changes, new developments (such as lower toxicity standards and technology improvements), and offsite consequences.  These revalidations occur every five years and the findings along with their resolutions are kept for the life of the process.  The revalidation process is currently underway.\n\nIMC-Agrico, Faustina facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Conducting training; (2) Developing written procedures; (3) Performing inspections and tests in accordance with recognized standards; and (4) Correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIMC-Agrico, Faustina facility  also has procedures in place to ensure continuation of the entire PSM program, including: writing and periodically updating operating procedures; training operators and maintenance personnel; management of change programs; contractor safety programs; plus developing an audit schedule that meets OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nIMC-Agrico, Fausti"

The storage vessel is constantly monitored by operators for ammonia leaks and has continuous monitoring electronic leak detection equipment with control room alarm monitoring the annular space between the double wall for ammonia leaks.  Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity.  In the event of a long term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared; sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish; or consumed in the granulation plants.  In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike completely surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety.  There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation.  A series of relief valves connected to a flare also protect the tank from overpressure.\n\nOther smaller pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessels in the ammonia plant have relief valves that are piped directly to a flare system or vented to atmosphere.  Other ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.  There are also automated shutdown systems for the anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant at the site.\n\nChlorine cylinders are provided by vendors who are required to maintain and inspect their mechanical integrity prior to shipping.
