The Risk Management Plan for the House of Raeford Arcadia facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system. Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. \n\nThe submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted in accordance with the 5-year update requirement. Following EPA Guidance provided during an audit, House of Raeford removed a second unnecessary Worst-Case Scenario and updated inaccurate population estimates for offsite impacts. Additionally, emergency contact information has been updated.\n\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies-\n\nThe House of Raeford Arcadia facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment, and property. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the House of Raeford Arcadia facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Action Plan. The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan are: to maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Managemen"

Jeff White, the Refrigeration Supervisor, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and are improved, as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n-Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled-\n\nThe House of Raeford Arcadia facility includes one (1) ammonia refrigeration process in two (2) systems with cooling and freezing capabilities. House of Raeford processes and freezes poultry products for distribution. \n\nThe EPA defines a process as any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities. For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process. \n\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in the process exceeds 10,000 pounds. The maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in the process is 35,000 lbs. of ammonia. Since an ammonia release from the systems could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulate"
