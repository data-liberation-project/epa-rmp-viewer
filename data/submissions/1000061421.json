The management system which maintains the RMP is defined by company procedure PM-001 Management Program\r\n\r\nEnable and the Caspiana Gas Plant have a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the process at the facility.  Enable's policy is to implement reasonable controls to reduce the likelihood releases of highly hazardous chemicals below unacceptable levels.\r\n\r\nThe facility information required by the RMP also aids local fire, police, and other emergency response personnel to prepare and respond in the event that an accidental release occurs. Making this information available to the public fosters communication and awareness to improve accident prevention and emergency response practices at the local level. Enable's policy is to coordinate emergency response activities with local emergency planning and/or response agencies.\r\n\r\n2.0 Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Gas Plant meets the definition of a stationary source and is located in Caddo Parish, Louisiana approximately 10 miles southwest of Shreveport, LA on Highway 1, Zip Code 71115. The facility GPS coordinates are 32.344975, -93.613042.    \r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Gas Plant is an unmanned facility and contains a single process, due to interconnection and colocation of process equipment.

The maximum intended inventory of LPG in the process at the facility is 174,600 lbs, the majority of which is contained by a 30,000 gallon bullet tank. There are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility.\r\n\r\nOther auxiliary operations at the facility include (1) glycol dehydration of the inlet field gas, (2) field liquid separation from the inlet gas stream, yielding produced water and condensate (NFPA 3 liquid), which are stored in atmospheric tanks, and (3) Compression of residue natural gas after LPG separation. The LPG product, condensate, and produced water are transported from the site via tanker trucks.  \r\n\r\n2.1 Hazard Assessment\r\n\r\n2.1.1 Worst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\r\n\r\nThe LPG (flammable mixture) resulted in the WCS. This was determined utilizing the EPA's RMP*Comp software to analyze the release of the largest quantity of LPG held in a single vessel or pipe resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, which is 162,768 lbs contained by a 100% full V-105 LPG Bullet Tank. This analysis yielded an endpoint to 1 psi overpressure of 0.3 miles. There is no residential population within the endpoint. However, industrial areas are present.\r\n\r\n2.1.2 Alternative Case Scenario (ACS)\r\n\r\nOne ACS to represent all flammable regulated substances was selected and analyzed for the process. The following types of releases were considered during the selection of the ACS:\r\n- Transfer hose releases due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling\r\n- Process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds\r\n- Process vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure\r\n- Vessel"

The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.  The flammable mixture is assumed to vaporize and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure. It was determined that a 10-minute release would involve 20,653 pounds of the flammable mixture (LPG). The ACS was analyzed utilizing the EPA's RMP*Comp software and yielded an endpoint of 0.1 miles. There is no residential population within the endpoint. However, industrial areas are present.\r\n2.2 RMP Program Level\r\n\r\nBased on (1) the quantity of LPG (a regulated substance) in the process at this stationary source, (2) the fact that no accidents have occurred at the facility in the last 5 years, (3) the presence of public receptors within the distance to the endpoint from the worst-case release scenario, and (4) the facility is not subject to 29CFR 1910.119, the Caspiana Gas Plant is subject to RMP Program 2 requirements.\r\n\r\n3.0 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the RMP Program 2 accident prevention program in place at the Caspiana Gas Plant.\r\n  \r\n3.1 Process Safety Information per Company procedure PM-202\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.

In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe company also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  Original equipment manufacturer information and industry standards are utilized to establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n3.2 Process Hazard Analysis per Company Procedure PM-204\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Where deficiencies are identified, recommendations are made to reduce associated risk below unacceptable levels.\r\n\r\nThe Caspiana Gas Plant primarily uses HAZOP methodology to perform these evaluations, also known as Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), performed by an interdisciplinary team. The PHA findings are systematically resolved in a timely manner acceptable to Enable Operations Leadership. \r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the Hazard Review team.\r\n\r\n3.3 Operating Procedures"
