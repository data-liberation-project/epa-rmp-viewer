      "SummaryText": "of release scenarios\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst-case release scenarios. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  \n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which an accidental release might affect the public (the endpoint distance).  The following could occur at the endpoint distance: Most people at the endpoint distance of a toxic substance release like TDI would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\n\t[Note: The following section entitled Worst-case release scenario is similar to those contained in EPA and industry guidance documents for risk management plans (RMPlans).  The EPA has decided not to include on the Internet the OCA data submitted in sections 2 \u00c2\u00bf 5 of the RMPlan.  In January 1999, the EPA also revised its guidance on the scenario sections of the Executive Summary to delete an earlier instruction to identify the distance to the endpoints.  The current guidance remains to describe each of the plant\u00c2\u00bfs scenarios but it has been revised for the plant to indicate whether the release has offsite impact.  The following scenario sections conform to this EPA guidance.]\n\nWorst-case release scenario.  \nDeleted per 4/19/2004 Rulemaking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe pl"

      "SummaryText": "BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFLEXIBLE FOAM PRODUCTS, INC.\n501 INDUSTRIAL BLVD.\nTERRELL, TEXAS 75160\n\nFlexible Foam, Inc. owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility on 501 Industrial Boulevard.  Flexible Foam receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  \n\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Rule.\n\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the 501 Industrial Boulevard facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building, the probability of release of toluene diisocyanate vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no inhabited receptors (buildings and people other than the Flexible facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored or unloaded toluene diisocyanate but undeveloped property beyond the property line to the East and South would be impacted by a worst-case scenario..  \n\nBecause there are public receptors (undeveloped) and there have been no significant incidents of release in the last five years, Flexible Foam, 501 Industrial Boulevard facility is classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\n\n WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nDELETED in Accordance with 4/19/2004 Rulemaking\n\nAt the Flexible Products, Inc. (Flexible Foam) plant in Terrell, Texas, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substa"

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to two standby railcars) at our plant is about 200,000 lb.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA\u00c2\u00bfs risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA\u00c2\u00bfs threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis"

Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI cannot impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  \n \n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and management system failures.\n \n In addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain or control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n \n\u00c2\u00bf Release Detection \n \n\u00c2\u00bf Process alarms (e.g., high level alarms and flow cutoff relays on the TDI storage tanks)\n\u00c2\u00bf Continuous operator surveillance (e.g., during TDI tanker unloading and TDI supply to the foam process)\n \n\u00c2\u00bf Release Containment/Control\n \n\u00c2\u00bf Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\n\u00c2\u00bf TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n\u00c2\u00bf Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n\u00c2\u00bf Pressure relief devices on equipment to prevent rupture\n\u00c2\u00bf Valves to permit isolation of process equipment\n\u00c2\u00bf TDI railcar inner tank surrounded by an outer shell filled with insulation\n\u00c2\u00bf Vapor displaced from storage tanks during unloading is vented through a carbon filter\n\u00c2\u00bf Facility personnel in attendance whenever TDI is being transferred from a bulk deliver \n  vessel to storage tanks.\n \n\u00c2\u00bf Release Mi"
