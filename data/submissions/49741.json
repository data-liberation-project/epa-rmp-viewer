For safety and environmental incidents, these policies could be summarized as follows:\n\n  -We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\n  -Our goal for incidents is zero.\n  -We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide leadership for our local communities to \n    help in their emergency preparedness.\n\nCorporate Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) policies are embodied in numerous site SHE procedures along with guidelines and recommended practices in DuPont Engineering Standards. Corporate SHE policies and Washington Works SHE procedures are available for review by all employees.\n\nAt Washington Works, SHE policies and procedures are also documented in the Washington Works SHE Manual.  Various procedures throughout the manual deal specifically with Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring.  It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor working on our behalf to comply with these procedures.  It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures. \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe DuPont Washington Works main plant site consists of approximately 450 acres located approximately five miles south of Parkersburg, WV.  Manufacturing operations are located on approximately 170 of the 450 acres.  Polymer resins and products in primary forms are manufactured at the site.  In addition to manufacturing operations and associated support facilities, the site also has areas dedicated to wildlife habitat and a local historic landmark that the site leases to the state for use by the public.  \n\nThe site uses the following EPA regulated RMP chemicals at levels above their process threshold quantities:\n\n               Toxics -  formaldehyde, anhydrous hydrochloric acid                    Flammables - tetrafluoroethylene\n\nGeneral Accidental Re"

This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  The standard involves the following activities as listed below: \n\nSafety in Design ...\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and \n  process design basis.\n- Extensive active and passive preventative and mitigating systems are strategically located.\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n- Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\n- Quality Assurance ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications and proper assembly.\n\nSafety in Maintenance...\n- Maintenance personnel are trained and experienced.\n- Contractors are trained and qualified.\n- A work permit system controls hazards.\n\nSafety in Operations...\n- Operators are trained and job qualified.\n- Technical resources are available and utilized as required.\n- Operators follow approved procedures.\n\nSafety through Reviews, Inspections, Process Hazards Analysis, Investigation and Auditing...\n- Routine safety inspections are conducted.\n- Corporate and independent audits and reviews are conducted.\n- Process Hazards Analyses are conducted.\n- Safety critical equipment is set up on a periodic inspection frequency to ensure ongoing mechanical \n   integrity.\n- Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to starting up any new or modified equipment.\n- Quality assurance of critical equipment ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications.\n- All incidents are investigated and actions taken to prevent recurrence. \n\nThese individual activities encompass the parts of our RMP prevention program and we have established specific controls to ensure that we are meeting these standards to prevent accidental releases.\n\nF"

It is believed that essentially all the tetrafluoroethylene present was consumed in the reaction.  However, one pound of tetrafluoroethylene was reported released in the accident history summary since the RMP Submit software will not accept an entry of less than 1 or zero.\n\nAnother incident involved a fire in which tetrafluoroethylene was present. It is believed that essentially all the tetrafluoroethylene present during the fire was consumed in the combustion process.  However, one pound of tetrafluoroethylene was reported released in the accident history summary since the RMP Submit software will not accept an entry of less than 1 or zero.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe site emergency response program is documented in the Washington Works Emergency Control Organization (ECO) Manual is available for review by all employees.\n\nThe Emergency Response program in place at Washington Works is such that plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases.  The program can be summarized as follows:\n\nTraining and preparation\n  -Plant personnel and emergency responders receive emergency response training.\n  -Emergency response plans are periodically reviewed and updated.\n  -The plant conducts periodic emergency drills, including critiques.\n  -A plant representative actively participates on the Washington and Wood Counties Local\n    Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs).\n\n-If a release with the potential for off-site impact occurs:\n -The plant emergency alarm is sounded.\n -The plant Emergency Control Organization (ECO) Headquarters is activated.\n -Plant emergency personnel respond.\n -Community responders are notified and asked to respond as appropriate.\n -The local Industrial Alert System is activated if warrented.\n\nPrograms detailing emergency res"

Employee suggestions, capital improvements, audit programs, and various other activities help to ensure that we provide safe, reliable processes. Other programs aimed at improving process safety and our emergency response planning include:\n\n- Recommendations developed during cyclic process hazards analyses that reduce the risks associated with our processes.\n - Providing additonal process safety training to technical perssonel in topics such as chemical reactivity, layer of protection analysis, and safety instrumented systems risk analysis.\n - Expanding periodic process safety metrics reporting to management."
