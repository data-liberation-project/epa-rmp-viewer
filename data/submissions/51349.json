In the event of an emergency, IMCO has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater\u00bfs Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nIMCO manufactures aluminum sows and molten aluminum in crucibles from various types of recycled aluminum scrap.  At the time of this submittal, IMCO is subject to the requirements under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions since the facility maintains chlorine on-site in a quantity greater than the 2,500 pounds threshold.  Chlorine is used at the facility to remove impurities from the recycled aluminum.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\nIMCO has administrative controls (operating procedures) which limit the amount of chlorine which can be stored on-site.  In addition, IMCO maintains passive mitigation measures by enclosing all chlorine operations and storage.  The worst-case release scenario at the IMCO facility is based on the accidental release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel, as specified in the regulation.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario is assumed to be failure of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  According to calculations performed using EPA guidance, the distance to the defined toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 3.0 miles for the worst-case release.  The alternate release scenario is assumed to be failure of a gasket or transfer hose when connecting the chlorine cylinder to the chlorine system.  According to calculations performed using EPA guidance, the distance to the toxic endpoints is 0.1 miles for the alternat"
