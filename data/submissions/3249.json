Our compliance promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  Our programs enable this facility to minimize the occurrence, and consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries,  illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applicable to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including their use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected, and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs minimize accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nDescription\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid.   This occurs within a closed system.   The system\u0012s  operation is very similar to that of a household refrigerator, though on a much larger scale.  The total ammonia inventory on site is 35,000 pounds.  The ammonia is used as a refrigeration agent for the frozen storage of bulk and repackaged veget"

Worst case weather patterns for this geographic area would allow fugitive emissions to travel up to 2.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment.  There are an estimated 14,000 persons residing within this 2.3 mile radius.  All of these persons have the potential to be effected by a release of this magnitude. \n\nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nWorse weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection, testing, and replacement of equipment if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nA breech or failure of  a < inch  diameter  pipe would result in the release of approximately 6,000 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 60 minutes, given high pressure receiver conditions at a release rate of 100 pounds per minute.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel up to .10 mile(s) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment.  There are an estimated 83 off site residents who would have the potential of being effected in the event of a release of this nature.  A < inch pipe was chosen because it is used to temp"
