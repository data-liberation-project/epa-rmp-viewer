      "SummaryText": "ce and Regulated Substances\n\n    FERRO PAD-FW is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 510 East Central Avenue in Fort Worth, Texas.  This plant is situated on approximately 12 acres in north Fort Worth.  The immediate area surrounding this plant is open undeveloped land to the north, industrial development including Witco Chemical to the east, and mixed industrial/residential zoned areas to the south and to the west.\n\n    Chemical manufacturing has been conducted at this location since the late 1940s.    This site makes a variety of specialty organic chemicals that are sold to the plastic and rubber industries.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Plant manufacturing activity can be broken down into three major product lines employing a total of 88 people. Except during Holiday shutdowns, the plant will be manned by one salaried production supervisor and 14 hourly plant operators.  During the Holiday Shutdown one alaried supervisor and at least one hourly operator are present.\n\n    One of the three major product lines operated at this facility is the fatty amide line which has been in operation since 1981.  Here, oleic acid is reacted with anhydrous ammonia to form fatty amide.  Fatty amides are used in the manufacturing of plastic films.  Actual reacting of the fatty acid is done under pressure in one of two process reactors.  Excess ammonia is vented from the reactor to the scrubber while in the venting mode at the end of the semi-continuous process.  Anhydrous Ammonia is supplied from a 12,000 gallon ammonia tank.\n. \n    Ferro PAD-FW  was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, the regulated substances and quantities kept on site were determined.  The facility uses one regulated substances in one process.  The chemical, process unit, largest quantity on site, and its threshold quantities are presented in Table 1.\n     TABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regul"

In addition, Ferro PAD-FW is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869).  Therefore, Ferro PAD-FW process is classified as Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n    1.3.1    Worst-Case Releases\n\n.        Toxic Substances\n\n        Endpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  The conditions at Ferro PAD-FW was reviewed to determine the substance with the  distance to an endpoint.\n\n        Table 2 shows the calculation parameter and distance to the toxic endpoint of 3.9 miles for Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model,which is greater than the 3.6 miles for a worst-case release of anhydrous  ammonia based on the EPA lookup tables.  Anhydrous ammonia is contained as a liquefied gas.  Under the ARP Program ['68.25(c)(1)], gases liquefied by pressure alone (i.e., without refrigeration) are released as a gas over 10 minutes for worst-case purposes.  Figure 2 shows the distance to the endpoint for anhydrous ammonia on a USGS map.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\nDistances to Endpoints for Toxic Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nChemical\nName    Amount \nReleased\n(gals)    \nLiquid\nDensity    \nWeight\n(lbs)    Distance to Toxic Endpoints\n(miles)\nanhydrous ammonia    12,000    4.94"

Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fenceline.  The following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\n          \n@@    Release rate dependent upon scenario;\n@@    Use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source;\n@@    Actual release height; and\n@@    Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is provided in response to the General Duty Clause under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for hydrogen as follows.  A rupture disk  on the hydrogen tank fails, allowing release of the contents into the atmosphere.  \n\nFor the alternative release a review of the consequences resulting from a vapor cloud release revealed that the distance to the  lower flammability limit (LFL) for the hydrogen vapor cloud was greaterthan the overpressure endpoint in the model. Therefore, the distance to the LFL was chosen as the altenative release scenario - exceedint the the distance-to-endpoint of one psi overpressure based on an explosion hazard.\n\nTable 3 shows the distances to the endpoint for the for the alternative-case release of hydrogen predicted using the ARCHIE model beause the minimum value from the EPA lookup tables list is 10,000 pounds. This is almost twice the quantity of hydrogen stored in our tank.  The alternative-case release of hydrogen resulted in a distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint of less than 0.08 miles.\n     TABLE 3\nDistance to Endpoint for Flammable Alternative-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nChemical\nName    \nAmount\nReleased\n(gals)    \n\nDensity\ngrams/liter    \n\nWeight\n(lbs)     Distance to LFL \nFrom lookup tables \n(miles)    Di"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n        Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific covered process areas, Ferro PAD-FW has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperatures, pressures).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems with a fog spray system and venting to a scrubber,  highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., emergency shutdown systems).\n\n        The plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n    1.4."

      "SummaryText": "3    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n        Ferro PAD-FW has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each new and alterred process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n        Ferro PAD-FW primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n        The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n        To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Ferro PAD-FW periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and 3 years for covered processes  and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for considerati"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate as part of the review of the Process Safety Management review every 3 years.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n    \n\n    1.4.5    Training\n\n        To complement the written procedures for process operations, Ferro PAD-FW  has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least annually in the case of ammonia hazards.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n    1.4.6    Contractors\n\n"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Ferro PAD-FW evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n    1.4.7    Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n        Ferro PAD-FW conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n    1.4.8    Mechanical Integrity\n\n        Ferro PAD-FW has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, "
