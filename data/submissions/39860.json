The plant started during World War II, as part of several facilities the government sponsored to produce synthetic rubber for the war effort.  After the war, the government-owned plant was inactive except for a brief time during the Korean War.  Rohm and Haas Company, a major U.S. chemical producer, bought the Louisville site in 1960.\n\nToday, Rohm and Haas Company produces over 200 different products at the Louisville plant. They are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in a wide variety of consumer products.  The three main product families are:  \n\u00b7 Plastic additives make plastic tough and moldable.

Acrylic coatings provide the finish for boats and the touch-up paint for cars.  The coatings also beautify and protect signs and steel.  They are used on metal furniture, the painted part of pencils, and the lining of soft drink cans.\n\nRohm and Haas Louisville produces more than one billion pound of product annually, has about 550 employees with annual payroll and benefits of over $40 million, and pays approximately $1.1 million annually in taxes (not including income tax).  Rohm and Haas contributes to many charitable organizations in the community. \n\n3.0 The EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act ' 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate worst case and alternate case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This document is part of Rohm and Haas Louisville\u00bfs RMP communication effort.  \n\n4.0 Regulated Substances\n\nOur plant uses three chemicals which are regulated by the RMP: \n\u00b7 1,3-butadiene monomer, an RMP flammable used in the production of plastic modifiers, \n\n\u00b7 Acrylonitrile monomer,  an RMP toxic that is a basis for some emulsion polymers, and \n\n\u00b7 Aque"

The Rohm and Haas Company Louisville plant has had no events meeting this criteria during the last five years.\n\n8.0 Emergency Response Program \n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Louisville plant has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lake Dreamland Fire Department, Rubbertown Mutual Aid Association, and other local response agencies. New employees are trained prior to working in a process area and plant personnel review the plan during annual safety meetings.  The plant has an extensive alarm system, which includes key alarms also sounding in the plant gate house. Most processes have remote shutdown capability, including those covered by RMP.  The plant has an on-site state-recognized fire department, with mobile fire protection vehicles as well as state-licensed ambulance service.  The site\u00bfs 24-hour emergency response team can respond to both on-site and transportation off-site hazardous materials releases. The site has direct radio contact with off-site responders and the ability to activate the community siren system.  Plant drills to practice proper response are held at least annually.\n\n 9.0 Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario (WCS), namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel  occurring  under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed.

Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  Our safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of  ways to improve safety performance.  For example, the plant switched from ammonia gas to aqueous ammonia (30% ammonia in water) in the late 1980\u00bfs in order to reduce risk.  Also, the plant has achieved OSHA\u00bfs Voluntary Protection Program certification.  The plant continues to identify and implement other safety improvement opportunities."

Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, these worse-case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS). Unlike worse-case scenarios, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.   According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning. \n\nWorst Case Scenarios:  \nRohm and Haas Company Louisville plant has identified two WCS based on the RMP definition: one for a toxic material and one for a flammable material.  The following is a description of our scenarios:\n\nWorst Case Toxic\nThis scenario involves acrylonitrile, which is considered a toxic material under the RMP rule.   It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of a 275,000 pound storage tank into the tank containment dike over a ten minute period.  The EPA\u00bfs tabulated dispersion predictions were used to determine the toxic endpoint of this release, and such a release could have a significant off-site impact.  Because of the plant controls, procedures and training, the worse case event is extremely unlikely. \n\nWorst Case Flammable  \nThis scenario involves releasing the maximum inventory of 1,3-butadiene from the storage tank.  Administrative procedures, controls and alarms limit the maximum inventory to 600,000 pounds.  1,3-butadiene is a flammable substance under the RMP rule.  The RMP rule assumes the entire vessel contents would be released, ignited, and result in a vapor cloud explosion.  We have applied EPA\u00bfs guidance and predicted endpoint distances to a one psi overpressure.  A vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory would have an effect on the Rohm and Haas site, as well as an effect on our near industrial and residential neighbo"

The 1,3 butadiene tanks are covered by the process safety management program and undergo integrity testing and inspections on a routine basis.  The area is constantly monitored with gas detectors.  Temperature detectors are tied into a water deluge system surrounding the storage tank. Because of the plant controls, procedures and training, the worse case event is extremely unlikely.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nRohm and Haas Company Louisville plant has identified three ARS: one for each toxic material (2) and one for butadiene, the flammable material.  These scenarios were chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenarios we have identified are more credible than those described in the worst case, but are still very unlikely given of the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Acrylonitrile (Toxic Liquid)\nThe RMP rule requires an alternate release scenario (ARS) be picked for each covered toxic material. The following is the alternate scenario description for acrylonitrile:\nIf a \u00bd inch drain valve were left open the entire contents of the transfer line from the storage tank to the production unit would be drained, and 1,000 pounds of acrylonitrile would be released. The area gas detectors would sound an alarm in the control room and automatically close the tank bottom valve.
