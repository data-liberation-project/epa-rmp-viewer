FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n      THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF SOUTHERN FS, INC ARE COMMITTED TO \n      THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL\n      RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n      OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. \n\n2.   THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY, WHICH IS LOCATED AT 21795 STATE HWY 14   MACEDONIA, IL,  IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED,  STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR  DIRECT APPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.  THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSIST OF 1 STORAGE TANK (30,000 GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS. ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n      THE MAXIMUN QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 340,000 LBS\n      THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS.\n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n    THIS FACILITY HAS DEVELOPED A WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. HOWEVER SINCE THIS IS SECURITY SENSITIVE INFORMATION IT HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM THIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AS REQUIRED BY EPA REGULATIONS.\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL\n      APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF\n      \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\",\n      PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIO"
