Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nGolden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by its accidental release prevention program that includes management practices in areas such as operating procedures, equipment maintenance, hazard analysis and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Golden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe facility's primary activity is the preparation of both grape juice and wine.  There is one regulated substance present at this facility that is subject to California Accidental Release Program/Risk Management Plan regulations, anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the cold storage refrigeration equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis, the EPA's RMP *Comp(TM) and 2000 US Census data for LandView 5 were used.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case:\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from the receiver tank.  In this scenario 2891 lbs. of Ammonia is released.  Ammonia liquefied under pressure is released to a pool with total vaporization assumed within 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation systems such as a building enclosure were taken into account to calculate this scenario.  A rural setting was used in RMP Comp.  The regulatory required atmospheric conditions were used: Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/second wind speed to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum distance to the toxic endpoin"

At class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 meters/second wind speed, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia, the endpoint reaches 0.3 miles.  According to the Landview Census 2000 Population estimator, there are sixteen persons with the potential for an offsite release in this scenario\n\n\n\nAlternative Most Likely Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 600 lbs. of ammonia vapor from a damaged valve that is assumed to be controlled in 30 minutes at a release rate of 200 lbs per minute.  No passive mitigation controls such as a building enclosure have been taken into account to calculate the scenario and the release is assumed to be controlled by the manual shutdown of the system.  At class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 meters/second wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.2 miles.  There is a total of twelve persons potentially affected by this scenario.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nGolden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the California Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements set out under CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our cold storage facility.\n\n\n\nSafety Information:\n\n\n\nGolden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Review:\n\n\n\nGolden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC has conducted a hazard review to ens"

Ammonia refrigeration plants are very different from complex chemical processing operations.  Many of the operations in chemical processing are not found in refrigeration plants.  There are no chemical reactions.  Moreover, ammonia refrigeration is a mature industry.  While there are new developments leading to more efficient operations, the design principles are fully available.  A complete understanding of the safe design and operating envelope is available to design practitioners in the industry.  Hazard reviews can result in findings or recommendations for improvements to prevent potential releases.  The management system includes that these findings or recommendations are promptly brought to resolution.  \n\n\n\nThe study will be re-evaluated at a regular interval of every five years or whenever major changes in the process are proposed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis will be addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nThe most recent review of hazards was performed on October 18, 2006.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Golden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nGolden Valley Grape Juice & Wine, LLC has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.
