We shall, as a minimum: (1)  consult  with\r\nemployees  and  their  representatives  on  the  conduct   and\r\ndevelopment of the process hazard review and other elements of\r\nthe risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and\r\ntheir representatives access to the process hazard review  and\r\nall  other  information required to be  developed  under  that\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe  City  of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance\r\nis   the  key  to  minimizing  the  potential  for  accidental\r\nreleases.   Standard  Operating Procedures  (SOPs)  have  been\r\nreviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform  their\r\nwork in a safe and efficient manner.\r\n\r\nThe  EPA  has  adopted a policy for non-responding  facilities\r\n(another  entity  has  agreed in advance  to  respond  to  the\r\nrelease).   This facility is a non-responding  facility.   The\r\nCity of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\r\n\r\nThis emergency response program does not include responses  to\r\nincidental   releases   of  hazardous  substances,   including\r\nchlorine,  where the substances can"

The training includes  classroom\r\nand  hands on training on the proper use of emergency response\r\nequipment and procedures.

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was  used  to\r\ndetermine  endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas\r\nmodel  is  required since chlorine is heavier than  air.
