The facility policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Elevator Co. are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Dept or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and  the environment.\n\n2. Facility information.\n    \n The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 300,000 pounds in our largest storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be 100,000 pounds,when unloading semi transports.\n\n3.The worst case release scenerio and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank, released as a gas over ten minutes  The maximum quantity would be 150,000 pound which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dipersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario is based on a 2 minute release from the two inch plumbing on the tank. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .6 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirementsfor the Storeage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute,and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) , 29 CFR 1910.111. \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

The Five Year Accident History \n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that :\n        have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n        to our knowlege, have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.The Emergency Response Program\n\n     The Facility has:\n\n         A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n         Provided state and local authorities, the emergency planning and community right to know             information required unde SARA title III (EPCRA)\n\n        Coordinate with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safety conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recomendations for implementation at this time."
