North Beach management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe North Beach Facility is owned by Pruet Production Co. At the facility, natural gas is received via pipeline and processed to remove the heavy hydrocarbons (NGLs) from the natural gas. The NGLs are stored in pressurized tanks and loaded into transport trucks for sale, while the clean natural gas is sold from the site via pipeline. NGL is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the North Beach facility in amounts above the threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by North Beach. These high standards include:\n\n*    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n*    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n*    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated wi"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Pruet Production Co. purchased the facility. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no RMP accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which is coordinated with local emergency response groups, such as the Paul Fire Department. The Conecuh County Sheriff is also involved in emergency response for the facility. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the prevention program are:\n\n*    The Management of Change provisions, which ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\n\n*    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions, which serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n*    The Mechanical Integrity provisions, which ensure that process equip"
