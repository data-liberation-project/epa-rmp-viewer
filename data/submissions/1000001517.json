Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitment of our employees and contractors, and open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through Responsible Care programs. Our high standards are achieved by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted releases will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable by remedy and shortcomings found during regular audits of our facility and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found as required by law.\n\n\n\nThe Riverton facility manufactures commercial grade sulfuric acid and Ultra Pure Acid (UPA Sulfuric Acid) from elemental sulfur and spent sulfuric acid in two separate process trains. Oleum is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Riverton facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantity. The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulation. The purpose of this RMP is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility. The covered process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes and standards and is being maintained, inspected, tested and operated in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Riverton facility has been operating unde"

      "SummaryText": "r the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program since 1998.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphases on safety has helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the additional prevention features implanted at this facility include the following:\n\n\n\nA?    We have provided safety showers and alarms in the Oleum process area.\n\n\n\nA?    We have implemented pump designs minimizing seal replacement and risk exposure.\n\n\n\nA?    We provide safety orientations to reflect our current hazards on site and how we can minimize exposures to personnel.\n\n\n\nA?    Extensive training on safety programs and environmental release controls is conducted each year for our employees.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident having resulted in offsite impacts or onsite injuries from the RMP regulated substance has occurred at the Riverton facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\n\n\nWe have a comprehensive emergency response program at the Riverton facility. A specific written Emergency Response Program Manual is in place and the plan is coordinated with the local officials. This includes coordination with the local fire department and the LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee). The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned or Current Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP prevention and PSM programs forms the framework on which we continue to improve the safety at the Riverton facility. Some key components of the programs include the following:\n\n\n\nA?    The Management Of Change (MOC) provisions ensure we consider the potential safety a"

The MOC process is now an electronic data base process where each MOC is completed, reviewed and signed off on electronically. \n\n\n\nA?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of the potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards. A new PHA is planned during 2009 for the covered process.\n\n\n\nA?    The Mechanical Integrity (MI) program provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.\n\n\n\nA?    The Riverton facility is involved in becoming a fully implemented Responsible Care facility. This includes the RC 14001 certification process that is being implanted at the local level. \n\n\n\nA?    Internal and third party compliance audits also ensure we maintain and increase the level of safety at the facility.\n\n"
