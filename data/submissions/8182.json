      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n\n1.  Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of Cottage Grove - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M Company, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M Company was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M Company has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent. \n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cottage Grove Fire Department arrives. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n \n3.  The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe manufacture specialty chemicals for internal and external customers for use in making a wide variety of products from sandpaper to medical imaging materials.  We use 2 regulated substances at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance. \n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Cottage Grove - 3M Company:\n\n7 Hydrogen fluoride/hyrodfluoric acid, a non-flammable, corrosive acid, is a key raw material used to make such products as replace"

These CFC replacements are used in the manufacture of semiconductors and in depositing special lubricants on memory discs for computers.\n\n7 Toluene Diisocyanate, a liquid used in making products such as resins, adhesives, and coating materials.  These products may be used to manufacture items such as sandpaper and  tape.\n\n\n4.  Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nEPA has directed all affected facilities to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility, as unlikely as that might be, and an alternative, more realistic, accident scenario.   \n\nTo evaluate our worst case and alternative release scenarios, we used look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA. The look-up tables indicate the worst case release scenario from Cottage Grove - 3M Company is a release of hydrogen fluoride in a gaseous form over a ten minute period, and includes the use of a building to limit the size of the release.\n\nThe worst case scenario for toluene diisocyanate was the release of material from an inside storage tank.  Analysis was performed using ALOHA release modeling.  Results show containment well within the site boundary.  The results of the worst case analysis analysis, combined with the 5 year history showing no accidental releases, qualify this as a Program 1 process.  Alternative release scenarios are not required for Program 1 processes.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrogen fluoride is a release for 10 minutes in a liquid form from an outside transfer pipe.\n\n\n5. Cottage Grove - 3M Company Program to Prevent Accidental Releases \n\nAt Cottage Grove - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notificatio"
