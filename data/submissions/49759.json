The butane blending system was engineered and constructed to meet the NFPA #58 1998 Edition.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Detroit Fire Department (Station #48 is the initial responder) as well as the Wayne County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local (EMS out of Station #48) Emergency Management Services and Oakwood Hospital.  This facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team (Technician Level) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  Additional hazmat capabilities are provided by Detroit's HazMat Unit 56.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Detroit Terminal is a bulk refined petroleum storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one 60,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's tank/cylinder when filled to the greatest amount allowed by the system (85%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate release scenario is a \"pull away\" accident resulting in a one-minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  This alternate scenario was based on an incident (other than a catastrophic tank failure) which would result in the greatest released quantity (a leaking butane pump was considered as the secondary choice) and have the greatest potential for off-site consequences.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Detroit Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Saf"

The system is currently approved by the State/Local Fire Marshal.\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Detroit Terminal's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Detroit Fire Department (initial response is expected to be from Station #48) and request their assistance.  The facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Wayne County LEPC.  The Detroit Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system."
