The regulation sets forth three levels of compliance, designated as Programs.  Program levels are determined by the facilities five year accidental release history, the distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint under a worst case release assessment, the process' NAICS code and whether the process is subject to OSHA's process safety management standard.\n\nHolland Company uses anhydrous ammonia as a part of its alum manufacturing process.  At any one time there may be 45,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on-site.  This amount exceeds the established threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds) and subjects Holland Company to the regulation.\n\nAlum manufacturing has an NAICS code of 325188 - Other Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing.  Holland Company falls within Program 3 requirements because the process is in NAICS code 325188 and the process is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n1.1.2 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     HANDLED\n40 CFR ?68.155(b)\n\nHolland Company is a manufacturer of ammonium alum, an inorganic chemical compound.  Holland Company's manufacturing process utilizes a stationary 10,000 gallon tank containing anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance and storage of this quantity qualifies Holland Company as a stationary source. \n\n1.1.3 OFFSITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSES\n40 CFR ?68.155(c)\n\nHolland Company's offsite consequences a"

      "SummaryText": "nalyses include consideration of two release scenarios, identified as the worst-case release and the alternative release.  The worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.\"  Pursuant to EPA's guidelines, Holland Company has assumed this worst-case to be the total release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is defined as one that is \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\" and \"will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.\"  Based on a process hazard analysis, Holland Company has selected a piping failure as an alternative release scenario.\n\n1.1.4 HOLLAND COMPANY'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION                 PROGRAM\n40 CFR ?68.155(d)\n\nHolland Company's accidental release prevention program is based on several key elements:\n\n?Training of operators and supervisors\n?Preventive maintenance\n?Use of equipment designed for anhydrous ammonia handling\n?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with participation of the operators\n?Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n?Implementation of an auditing and investigation program.\n\n1.1.5 HOLLAND COMPANY'S FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n40 CFR ?68.155(e)\n\nIn the previous five years, Holland Company has had no accidental releases involving anhydrous ammonia.   \n\n1.1.6 HOLLAND COMPANY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n40 CFR ?68.155(f)\n\nThe provisions of 40 CFR 68, Subpart E - Emergency Response require stationary sources with Program 3 processes to develop and implement an emergency response program.  An exception exists for those stationary sources whose employees ?will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances? (40 CFR ?69.90(b)) provided that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place t"

      "SummaryText": "o notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  \n\nThe EPA has interpreted the term response, as used in Subpart E of 40 CFR to exclude \"response to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substances can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.\"  Actions such as \"end[ing] a small leak (e.g. shutting a valve) or clean[ing] a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard\" are considered incidental responses that would not require development of an emergency response program.\n\nIn recognition of the danger that a release of anhydrous ammonia would pose to its employees, it has been the continuing policy of Holland Company to respond only to incidental releases.  In the event of a major release, Holland Company will immediately contact local emergency response personnel.  The emergency response personnel will have complete authority and control over response actions.  This policy exempts Holland Company from the development of an emergency response program.\n\n1.1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n40 CFR ?68.155(g)\n\nA Process Hazard Team was initially convened in 1999 to review Holland Company's equipment and operating procedures.  The members of the team included the General Manager, Plant Engineer, and Shift Supervisor from Holland Company, as well as an Environmental Regulatory Compliance Specialist from Berkshire Environmental Consultants, Inc.\n\nThe team made several recommendations regarding safety.  Holland Company reviewed these recommendations and has taken several steps to improve safety."
