It is assumed that the entire contents of the two adjoined tanks are released as a vapor which finds an ignition source. 10% of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is 0.355 mile with the distance for radiant heat dose of 5 kW/square meter of 0.347 for the worst case scenario. \n\nUsing the equations for calculating over pressure from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAG).\n? The endpoint for VCM is 0.355 mile (1875 feet).\n\nUsing Fire Radiation Table 22, Page 68 of OCAG.\n? Endpoint for VCM is 0.347 miles (1832 feet).\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA failure of the hose connecting a rail car to the unloading apparatus. The excess flow valve(s) function to limit the flow. The entire contents of the tank car, 180,000 pounds of VCM are released in 3.5 hours. Unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit(LFL). \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the LFL for the alternative scenario is less than 317 feet.\n\nUsing Exhibit C-2, page 98 of OCAG. \n? LFL of VCM is 92 mg/l \n\nUsing Reference Table 21, Page 65 of OCAG.\n? Distance to LFL for 1,000 pound/minute release rate is <0.06 mile. (317 feet)\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nPolyOne Corporation has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard(PSM) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals(29 CFR 1910.119) VCM, the same substance i"
