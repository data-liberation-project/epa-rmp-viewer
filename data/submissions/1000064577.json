      "SummaryText": "RMP Louisville Executive Summary\r\nPlease note: Butane and Propane, while both are above threshold quantities, are considered the same for emergency response and below scenario evaluation. \r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nThe Sealed Air Plant at Louisville has implemented an accidental Release Prevention Policy which integrates hydrocarbon sensors, redundant safety systems, alarm systems, stringent inspection, testing and calibration procedures, operational procedures, and management practices. All applicable EPA, OSHA, Kentucky and Louisville environmental health and safety regulations are adhered to. The Sealed Air, Louisville Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans which are detailed in the Emergency Response Plan. This includes trained on site emergency responders for all operational hours and automatic systems that will stop the process and notify the local fire department.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\r\nThe Louisville Plant manufactures plastic foam packaging, and uses Butane as a blowing agent to make the plastic foam. This is the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location. Butane is a flammable hydrocarbon stored and used in liquid form by keeping the material under pressure, but is released as a gas during the manufacturing process. This gas is collected and sent to an oxidizer in order to control emissions.\r\n\r\n3. Worst and Alternate Case Scenarios:\r\nThe Worst-case Release scenario is defined by EPA in the OCA as failure of the largest tank when full, and the vapors find an ignition source and the release explodes. The endpoint for a 1 psi overpressure is .43 miles. The plant is located in an industrial park with no residential receptors close by.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release scenario, or more credible scenario, is based upon catastrophic failure of the 2in delivery piping and a 30 second release before the excess flow valve fully seals off the flow."

The General Sealed Air Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention  Steps:\r\n* PSM process reviewed annually.\r\n* System of hydrocarbon sensors at critical points of storage, piping, pumping, and manufacturing to identify releases.\r\n* Staged alarm, increased ventilation, automatic process shutdown, and activation of evacuation alarm by hydrocarbon sensors.\r\n* Employee monitoring and safety check off for unloading and tank filling operation.\r\n* Frequent checks of components and piping.\r\n* Regularly scheduled preventative maintenance.\r\n* Routine periodic testing of sensors, interlocks, safeties, and alarms.\r\n* Hydrocarbon Safety Program - corporate safety program that identifies minimum standards for the safe use of hydrocarbons including training of employees and visitors, systems, detection, static control, procedures, equipment and ventilation.\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History: \r\nNone.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program:\r\nAll employees are trained on Emergency Action Plan including alarm response and building evacuation. There is a trained emergency Response Team for minor leak repairs and incipient fire fighting. Fire alarm will automatically summon the local fire department, shut down the process, and shut off the gas supply. Pre-planning will be conducted with the local fire department. Emergency operation and response will be reviewed on an annual basis."
