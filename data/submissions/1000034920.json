      "SummaryText": "Lisbon Gas Plant Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant, located in the Lisbon Valley Industrial Area, 35 miles south of Moab (San Juan County), Utah, operates a process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, crude oil, condensate) from natural gas. The Lisbon Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. The Lisbon Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the Program Level 3 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 300,000 lbs. (80% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the l-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 mile, resulting in offsite impact. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.4 mile, resulting in offsite impact. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because the process at the gas plant that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation o"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) .This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety- related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identifi"

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) and whatif/checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process opera"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the Lisbon Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\n\n\nTraining \n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lisbon Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Lisbon Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps"

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels) .If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Lisbon Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

If an incident did occur, we would investigate the incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency respons"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant process or other Lisbon Gas Plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training personnel in the changes. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Lisbon Gas Plant is coordinated with the San Juan County, Utah, local emergency planning committee (LEPC) .This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. \n\n\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) .This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Lisbon Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the gas plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant."
