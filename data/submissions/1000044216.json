As part of this commitment, NDP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at NDP and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the site.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Nippon Dynawave packaging Co.\n\n\n\nThe NDP risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n?    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n\n?    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\n\n?    An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6.\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at Nippon Dynawave Packaging Company is only one component of the safety program. NDP maintains comprehensive safety program which establishes many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous su"

Before using a hazardous substance at NDP, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is proposed for use at NDP, NDP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect NDP workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nNDP reduces the inventory of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at NDP, NDP limits the inventory of this substance to the lowest practical level whenever possible. NDP uses a formal Chemical Management Program to support the limitation and reduction of hazardous substance inventories.  This program is designed to promote safe handling, storage, and use of chemicals as well as to limit the number and amount of chemicals stored on-site.\n\n\n\nNDP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at NDP, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nNDP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  NDP trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  We have trained incident commanders on call at all times and trained operators in the units  . In addition, NDP works with the local emergency response agencies and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help minimize the potential for injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at NDP consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Re"

      "SummaryText": "sponse Policies\n\n\n\nNDP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  We have implemented reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate hazards.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we work to control and contain the release in a manner that provides for the safety of workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  We provide response training to NDP personnel, designate an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinate response efforts with the local emergency response agencies.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, NDP established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety and the Environmental Manager to oversee emergency response-related activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Nippon Dynawave Packaging Company and Regulated Substances\n\nNDP is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.  As part of these manufacturing processes, NDP handles Chlorine in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. The Chemical Supply area has Chlorine, a toxic gas liquefied by pressure, with a process inventory of up to 180 tons.  It is a Level 3 RMProgram.\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nNDP performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by NDP.  These requirements are:\n\n\n\n?    One worst-case release scenario for our toxic substances in Program 3 chlorine.\n\n?    One alternative release scenario for our toxic substances in a Program 3 chlorine.\n\n \n\nDetailed information is included in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMPlan.\n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of NDP's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\nThe NDP Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n1.

The covered processes have been formally reviewed with Process Hazard Analyses (PHA's).  NDP will periodically updates those analyses to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Past PHA's primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel.\n\n\n\n3. Operating Procedures.  NDP process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.
