As part of this commitment, NDP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at NDP and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the site.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Nippon Dynawave packaging Co.\r\n\r\nThe NDP risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\r\n\u00bf\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\r\n\u00bf\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6.\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at Nippon Dynawave Packaging Company is only one component of the safety program.

The covered processes have been formally reviewed with Process Hazard Analyses (PHA's).  NDP will periodically updates those analyses to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Past PHA's primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel.\r\n\r\n3. Operating Procedures.  NDP process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSteps for safely conducting activities.\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations.\r\n\u00bf\tSafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs.\r\n\r\nNDP personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the processes and as a training guide.\r\n\r\n4. Training.  NDP trains"

The NDP training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\r\n\r\nThe operators are consulted to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\n5. Mechanical Integrity.  NDP maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The NDP mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes.  The NDP mechanical integrity program includes:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSpecifications for inspection and testing of process equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tSpecifications for replacement parts and equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, and line or equipment opening.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining of maintenance personnel.\r\n\u00bf\tDocumentation of maintenance activities.\r\n\r\n6.

Pre-startup Review.  NDP performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tConstruction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\r\n\u00bf\tAdequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place.\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee training has been completed.\r\n\r\nFor a covered process, a PHA is performed if the process is new or management of change requirements are completed if an existing process is modified.\r\n\r\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\r\n\r\n8. Compliance Audit.  NDP audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the covered operations.  NDP assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n9. Incident Investigation.

Before using a hazardous substance at NDP, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is proposed for use at NDP, NDP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect NDP workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nNDP reduces the inventory of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at NDP, NDP limits the inventory of this substance to the lowest practical level whenever possible. NDP uses a formal Chemical Management Program to support the limitation and reduction of hazardous substance inventories.  This program is designed to promote safe handling, storage, and use of chemicals as well as to limit the number and amount of chemicals stored on-site.\r\n\r\nNDP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at NDP, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nNDP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  NDP trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  We have trained incident commanders on call at all times and trained operators in the units  . In addition, NDP works with the local emergency response agencies and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help minimize the potential for injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\r\n\r\nThe safety program at NDP consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

NDP uses a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of NDP workers are addressed.  NDP encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHA's and operating procedures.\r\n\r\n11. Hot Work Permits.  NDP uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the NDP facility.  This permit program was developed to comply with OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a).  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The trained Shift Supervisor or designee (Permit Authorizing Individual, PAI) reviews the completed form before work can begin.  \r\n\r\n12. Contractors.  NDP established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the NDP facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record and safety programs of all contractors to help ensure that NDP only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  NDP explains to the contractor supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, NDP safe work practices, and NDP emergency response procedures.  NDP requires that the contractor train each of their employees who will work at NDP before that worker begins work at the site.  \r\n\r\nNDP further requires contractors to develop and use a Safe Work Plan for the work scheduled.

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nChlorine.  Chlorine is used following standard industry equipment and procedures. The chlorine vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved rail car.  NDP employees follow DOT standards when transferring to the chlorine storage tanks.  There are control system interlocks which isolate the storage tanks from the unloading process in the case sensors detect chlorine in the unloading area.  In addition, chlorine detectors and alarms are located in the process areas and around the perimeter of the manufacturing area to warn of leaks. Workers who perform operations involving chlorine receive function-specific training emphasizing safe handling procedures for chlorine.\r\n\r\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\r\nA review of the five-year accident history at the NDP site shows safe on-going operations.  There have not been any releases at the facility that resulted in injury or property damage, as described in the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\r\nNDP continues to use the written emergency response program at the facility.  That plan guides the safe response to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tInforming the local emergency response agencies and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences.\r\n\u00bf\tProviding proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances.\r\n\u00bf\tControlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tInspecting and maintaining emergency response equip"

All NDP personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  NDP periodically conducts emergency response drills coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nNDP contracts for Hazardous Materials response services with local emergency response agencies and regularly drills such response incidents with them.  We further use a local ChloRep Team for emergency response to chlorine-related releases from rail cars.  \r\n\r\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local emergency response agencies.  NDP maintains a regular dialogue with the local emergency response agencies, and provides appropriate information to these agencies.\r\n\r\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nNDP strives to improve safety continuously through both the incident investigation program and by soliciting safety suggestions from the workers."

      "SummaryText": "sponse Policies\r\n\r\nNDP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  We have implemented reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate hazards.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, we work to control and contain the release in a manner that provides for the safety of workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  We provide response training to NDP personnel, designate an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinate response efforts with the local emergency response agencies.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\r\n\r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, NDP established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety and the Environmental Manager to oversee emergency response-related activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 Nippon Dynawave Packaging Company and Regulated Substances\r\nNDP is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.  As part of these manufacturing processes, NDP handles Chlorine in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. The Chemical Supply area has Chlorine, a toxic gas liquefied by pressure, with a process inventory of up to 180 tons.  It is a Level 3 RMProgram.\r\n\r\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nNDP performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenarios. The alternative release scenario was selected"

      "SummaryText": "to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  \r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by NDP.  These requirements are:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOne worst-case release scenario for our toxic substances in Program 3 chlorine.\r\n\u00bf\tOne alternative release scenario for our toxic substances in a Program 3 chlorine.\r\n \r\nDetailed information is included in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMPlan.\r\n\r\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of NDP's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nThe NDP Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n1. Process Safety Information, NDP maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the NDP processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled, (2) operating parameters of the equipment at NDP, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at NDP.  NDP ensures that this process safety information is availa"
