      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nLike most beef processing facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material. \r\n\r\nNebraska Beef is committed to maintaining a safe processing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Nebraska Beef places its responsibility as an environmental steward as one of its chief priorities. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. \r\n\r\nWe used the EPA's ammonia model ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels. (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.) \r\n\r\nThe facility has had zero reportable accidental releases in the last five years. There was 2 minor vapor releases with no injuries or offsite consequences and the releases were dealt with in-house.\r\n\r\nA copy of the site's emergency plans has been sent to the Douglas County LEPC and the local Fire Department tours the facility on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nThrough our RMP program, Nebraska Beef looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility."
