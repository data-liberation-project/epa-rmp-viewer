The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in plant annual emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response.    \r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel about the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Sage Creek Gas Plant is coordinated with the Converse County LEPC, which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The Sage Creek Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, audits, and incident investigations."

The Sage Creek Gas Plant is classified as a RMP Program Level 1 because there are no public receptors identified within the worst-case scenario (WCS) 1-psi endpoint and there have been no accidental RMP emergency releases within the past five years. \r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Sage Creek Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n  --  Daily operator inspection\r\n  --  Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\r\n  --  High/Low alarms and shutdowns\r\n  --  Facility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n  --  Process relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization\r\n  --  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n  --  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n  --  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\r\n  --  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., backup pumps, etc.).\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n  --  Trained emergency response personnel (HAZWOPER, fire response)\r\n  --  Personal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, SCBA, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant experienced no reportable accidents in the past 5 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \r\n\r\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant maintains a written emergency resp"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to and contain the release. ONEOK Rockies Midstream, LLC (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant, located near Glenrock, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate from the produced well stream.  In addition, the plant operates a NGL extraction process to produce an NGL product.  The Sage Creek Gas Plant has regulated flammables from Butane through Pentane.  These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and as essential pure compounds. The facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels. \r\n\r\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as Program Level 1 under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and handled accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL"
