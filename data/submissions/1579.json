Major components in the facility include the office\\laboratory building, the chlorine cylinder storage building, an equipment storage building, a maintenance shop building, a chlorine ejector building, an auxillary power system, and ten  concrete tanks of various sizes and designs containing the equipment necessary for this treatment and reclamation of wastewater.\n\nChlorine is used in the disenfection of the treated water leaving the plant and is stored  in one ton cylinders in the chlorine  cylinder storage building, located just to the West of the office\\laboratory building.   Quantities stored at this site vary from less than 500 lbs. to a maximum of 6000 lbs. depending on usage and time since restocking took place.\n\nThe facility's Risk Management Plan is very specific in the precautions necessary for the safe handling, storage, and usage of this chlorine.
