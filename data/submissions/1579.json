Major components in the facility include the office\\laboratory building, the chlorine cylinder storage building, an equipment storage building, a maintenance shop building, a chlorine ejector building, an auxillary power system, and ten  concrete tanks of various sizes and designs containing the equipment necessary for this treatment and reclamation of wastewater.\n\nChlorine is used in the disenfection of the treated water leaving the plant and is stored  in one ton cylinders in the chlorine  cylinder storage building, located just to the West of the office\\laboratory building.   Quantities stored at this site vary from less than 500 lbs. to a maximum of 6000 lbs. depending on usage and time since restocking took place.\n\nThe facility's Risk Management Plan is very specific in the precautions necessary for the safe handling, storage, and usage of this chlorine.  These precautions include the followng:\n     1.   Two operators who are state certified and have received training in the usage and handling of         \n            chlorine are required to be present, and in self contained breathing apparatus whenever \n            connecting or disconnecting a chlorine cylinder.\n\n      2.   All personnel are to become aware of the material properties, and hazards of chlorine and the\n            use of chlorine in the plant's processes and the plant specific characteristics of the operation of \n            the equipment which comprises the chlorine portion of the process.\n\n       3.  All personnel are to be familar with the safety systems built in to the plant to prevent an \n            accidental release of chlorine into the atmosphere.\n\n       4.  All rules and regulations of this plan are to be followed by all personnel at all times.\n\nIn the past five years the only releases which have occurred at the facil"

These\nreleases have been very small in volume and the problem/s causing the leaks have been corrected by\nthe staff without any injury or damage.   An electrical, with battery backup, gas detector and alarm system\nis located in the storage building and will sound an immediate alarm in case of even a small leak. \n\nIn event of an \"uncontrolled Chlorine release\" which is a leak that is beyond the immediate control of the \nfacility staff, the Police/Fire Department dispatcher is to be notified, along with the Chief Operator or\nSuperintendent.  The Fire Department personnel will respond and take immediate charge of the\nsituation and will remain in charge until the problem has been corrected and normal facility operations\ncan resume.\n\nConstant awareness and operational procedure training is carried out in order ensure a safe operation\nin this area.  The 17 page Risk Management Plant is available to the staff at all times as a part of the\nprinted  \" Standard Operating Procedures\"  for the facility."
