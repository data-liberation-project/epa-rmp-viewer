This would add an additional 144,600 pounds of product ( filled at 85%).  This makes a total storage capacity of 354,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored at the Protection Anhydrous Plant.\n\nOur plant is operated and maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are training at a state school every three years and company wide on a yearly basis on the proper procedures to operate the plant, as well as the procedures to full a nurse tank.
