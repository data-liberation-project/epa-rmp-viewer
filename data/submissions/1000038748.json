We have:\r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\r\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility business practices\r\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\r\n\r\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nParamount Citrus D1 operates a commercial packing and storage facility for oranges in Delano, CA. The facility has three ammonia systems (SER Degreening, NER Cold Storage, and NWER Cold Storage).  \r\n\r\nThe SER Degreening System provides refrigeration capacity to one (1) plate and frame heat exchanger that is used to chill glycol.  The NER Cold Storage System provides refrigeration capacity to three (3) cold storage rooms and one (1) loading dock.  The NWER System provides refrigeration capacity to one (1) cold storage room and (1) packaging room.  Each system has an Allen Bradley PLC that provides substantial control and alarm capability.\r\n\r\nBoth the Degreening and NER Cold Storage Systems are pumped overfeed systems and operate as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The res"

      "SummaryText": "idual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the suction gas is piped to screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to a thermosyphon vessel, and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.\r\n\r\nThe Paramount Citrus D1 facility was originally built in the 1998 by California Controlled Atmosphere and has been added to since that time.  Most recently the following projects have occurred:\r\n\r\n2012/2013 - American Incorporated renovated the computer control system (Cold Storage System and Degreening System)\r\n\r\n2012 - American Incorporated installed new evaporative condensers on both systems.\r\n\r\n2012 - American Incorporated installed a new high pressure receiver, screw compressor, cold box, and loading dock (Cold Storage System)\r\n\r\n2013-2014 - American Incorporated installed the NWER System at Paramount Citrus D1, which provides refrigeration capacity to Cold Box 4 and a packaging room. \r\n\r\nThe NWER System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into the liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into an air-cooling evaporator. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas"

      "SummaryText": "in the recirculator and the suction gas is piped to the two (2) screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to the water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe NWER System was built in accordance with the 2010 California Mechanical Code. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia systems at Paramount Citrus D1 consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1 GENERAL\r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss\r\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nParamount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for\r\nthe purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Paramount Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this\r\nprocess is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure t"
