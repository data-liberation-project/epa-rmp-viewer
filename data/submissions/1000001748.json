The facility is located in an undeveloped area approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Mojave.  The Mojave Airport, which is the nearest neighboring facility, is approximately 1 mile away. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. Mojave facility which involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine (i.e., chlorine is the only regulated substance which is handled at the facility above the threshold quantity).  \n\n\n\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nPRIMARY OPERATIONS\n\n\n\nThe primary operation conducted at Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. Mojave facility is the manufacture of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride (NAICS Code 325188, SIC Code 2819).  The primary components utilized in the process include water, hydrochloric acid, chlorine and scrap iron.  Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the above-referenced regulations.  Chlorine is the only such regulated substance handled at the facility.  Provided below, is a brief description of the storage, handling and use of chlorine at the site.\n\n\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing process consists of the following components:\n\n\n\n- A maximum of twenty 90-ton railcars of chlorine (i.e., a maximum onsite inventory of"

      "SummaryText": " 3,600,000 pounds of chlorine);\n\n- Two continuous chlorinators for reacting water, chlorine, and hydrochloric acid to manufacture ferrous chloride;\n\n- Three chlorinators utilized to convert ferrous chloride to ferric chloride; \n\n- Two settling tanks;\n\n- A number of heat exchangers; and\n\n- System piping, controls and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nNinety ton railcars of chlorine are delivered to the facility and parked in dedicated spots.  Liquid chlorine from the railcars, hydrochloric acid and water are mixed in two continuous chlorinators.  The resulting solution is circulated through dissolver tanks containing scrap iron/steel.  This results in the manufacture of a weak ferrous chloride solution.  The solution is then recirculated until a rich ferrous chloride solution is made.  \n\n\n\nThe rich ferrous chloride solution is fed to three chlorinators.  Chlorine is added to the chlorinators until the desired ferric chloride solution is manufactured.  The resulting solution is then sent to product storage tanks.\n\n\n\nCentral Emergency Vacuum Relief Device (CEVRD)\n\nThe Mojave Plant has installed a central emergency vacuum relief device (CEVRD).  The CEVRD is connected to the overhead relief of each of the chlorinators onsite.  The CEVRD utilizes a solution of ferrous chloride to scrub out excess chlorine.  \n\n\n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\n\n- the worst case release; and\n\n- an alternative release (that is more credible).\n\n\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the RMP.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed in the technical studies maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nES 3.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submitt"

      "SummaryText": "al of this RMP, the facility has had one release of chlorine which resulted in a lost time accident of an employee.  The incident occurred on 7/31/2006.  Chlorine gas came out of a drain valve on a feed line to the process which was left open during process start up.  The incident resulted in a release of 0.1 pounds of chlorine gas.  An employee was working nearby and smelled the chlorine.  During the rest of the work day, the employee continued working, claiming he was fine.  After work he decided to see a doctor who then perscribed two days of bed rest before coming back to work.  This employee never showed any signs of chlorine exposure, but because he missed two days of work at the request of a doctor, the incident is recorded as an LTA (lost time accident) which then requires reporting under the RMP program.  The incident was investigated and a list of corrective actions were created.  The corrective actions were completed by 1/31/2007. \n\n  During this incident there were no:\n\n- Onsite deaths or significant property damage; or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nES 4.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. Mojave facility consists of a series of programs, procedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving chlorine.  These programs include design and operating controls, compliance with specified codes, the facility's health and safety program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program), site security, the management of change program, pre-start-up safety review, fire prevention/fire protection/hot work permit program, management of- and safety of- contractors, accident/incident investigation procedures, emergency response "

Details of each of these components of the facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program are provided in the document entitled Risk Management Plan (RMP), Volume I - Prevention Program (maintained at the facility).  \n\n\n\nThere are several chlorine leak detection and monitoring devices and other protective devices (e.g.., for fire protection, etc.) placed at strategic locations throughout the facility. In addition, the site has both manual and automatic shutoff systems to stop the flow of chlorine in an emergency.\n\n\n\nES 5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nKemira Water Solutions, Inc. recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.   As such, the Mojave Plant currently has emergency action plans and emergency evacuation plans in place. In addition, the facility has developed a Fire Prevention Plan.  These programs work together to mitigate the effects of unplanned releases or events.  However, as a continuous measure to improve safety, the facility reviews its emergency response plan, evacuation plan and fire prevention plan on a continuous basis.  This also ensures that the facility incorporates the latest safety developments into its existing programs.\n\n\n\nES 6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., hazards analysis) was performed on ALL operations involving chlorine in order to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.
