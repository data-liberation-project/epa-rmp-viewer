There have been no accidents in the past 5 years.\n\nB.     Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\n\nThis facility strives to meet or exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia     regulations. Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee and also and every three years as required by OSHA. The anhydrous ammonia tank(s) and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. Pressurized tank(s) and plumbing are tested according to the standards for the pressure vessel testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbilene Products has implemented a comprehensive program at its facility designed to safeguard the environment, its workers and the surrounding communities. The layers of protection are the numerous prevention mechanisms implemented at the Company's fertilizer storage facility to help manage the risks inherent in handling anhydrous ammonia. The key safety features are listed below.\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive reviews to insure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. These reviews are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard. One of these reviews is a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is designed to identify all failure scenarios that could lead to a significant exposure of ammonia to workers, the public, or the environment. The review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineerin"
