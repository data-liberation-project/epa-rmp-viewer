In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nSylva Terminal & Storage has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nSylva Terminal & Storage uses an Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Sylva Terminal is an LPG storage facility which stores propane for transport truck loading. The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68. We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility receives, stores and distributes propane LPG. There are eight tanks which receive propane from rail tank cars unloaded at the facility. The propane is transferred to the terminal storage tanks for loading into delivery trucks. The tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.
