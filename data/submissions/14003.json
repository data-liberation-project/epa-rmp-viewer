The facility policy; The owner, management of Cameron's anhydrous ammonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2.  Facility information;  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for home use and sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maxinum quantity stored would be 52000 pounds in the facility's 1 tank. The capacity of the tank is 12000 gallons.\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario; would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximun quantity released would be 47666 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 3/4 of a mile.\n\n\n4.  The alternative-case release scenario; is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch tranfer hose, with 5954 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles."
