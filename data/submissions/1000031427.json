This program consists of process safety issues, which includes following information:\r\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the standard operating procedures associated with all equipment and systems.\r\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity.\r\n - Initial and regular review of new or modified processes that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps \r\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide 1-ton cylinders are stored in designated areas. The containers have fusible metal plugs designed to melt between 158 - 165\u00b0 F (70 - 74\u00b0 C) to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of exposure to high temperat"
