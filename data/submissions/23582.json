      "SummaryText": "Facility:  Farmers 4 County Coop Association; Blairstown, IA\nContact:  Dennis McLeod\nPhone:  319-444-2154\n\n1. Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers 4 County Coop Association of Blairstown, IA (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. About 196,000 pounds is held in storage and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release scenarios: A) The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion (200 parts per million, ppm) is about 2.6 miles. B) The alternate case scenario, based on the 5 year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The release would occur over 2 minutes from a 3 inch hose. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been ado"

Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor, to our knowledge, have resulted in any such impacts off-site.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written action plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time"
