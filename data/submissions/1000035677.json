      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\n\n\nThe Praxair facility at Marmet, West Virginia is a carbon dioxide purification plant.  We receive carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct from a nearby natural gas well source.  Normally, this carbon dioxide gas is vented to the atmosphere, but it is collected and transferred to our facility via pipeline.  Praxair purifies and liquefies the carbon dioxide using a simple process of drying and distillation.  The final liquid carbon dioxide product is stored in our insulated storage tanks, and is shipped by truck and railcar to customers throughout the east.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAs part of the carbon dioxide production process, the Marmet facility uses a standard ammonia refrigeration process to purify and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  Similar to the freon used in a home refrigerator, the ammonia is neither produced nor consumed in the process, but is repeatedly compressed, cooled and expanded in order to produce the cold temperatures necessary to cool and condense the carbon dioxide gas.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the c"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity. \n\n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \n\n\n\nPraxair has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n- Ammonia sparger system to prevent releases of ammonia to the atmosphere from process relief devices\n\n- Ammonia monitoring system designed to shut down the process in the event of an uncontrolled release.\n\n- Automatic isolation of critical ammonia processes to minimize releases to the atm"

There have been no other reportable accidents in the last 5 years of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.  Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\n\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with  the Marmet Volunteer Fire Department and the Chesapeake Fire Department. The Marmet Fire Department is the primary responder and Chesapeake is the alternate responder. Emergency response is also coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Co. LEPC.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies..\n\n\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
