The City's WTP uses a groundwater supply as its source water.  Treatment processes include softening, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, corrosion control, fluoride adjustment and disinfection.  Chlorine gas is used for disinfection at the City's WTP.  Chlorine gas is the only regulated substance addressed by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is used and/or stored at the plant.\n\nChlorine is purchased in 1-ton cylinders and stored in the chlorine cylinder storage area located at the southeast corner of the building.  Space is available for the storage of five 1-ton cylinders at this location.  However, during normal operating procedures the maximum number of full cylinders at this location is three.  Two cylinders are located within the plant's chlorine room and are used as the source of the chlorine feed.  Chlorine gas is fed from the cylinders by a three-eighth-inch line to two gas chlorinators where it is converted to solution.  The chlorine solution is then sent to two rotometers where it is diluted and sent to feed points within the plant.  \n\nThe City's WTP personnel have an existing program in place for preventing the accidental release of chlorine.  A 12-step written procedure for changing chlorine cylinders is maintained on file and is currently used by employees when changing cylinders.  Employees are required to review the procedures on an annual basis.  A list of chlorine maintenance procedures is maintained on file and used by employees for the periodic checking, cleaning, and maintaining of all chlorine feed system components.  Safety information and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for chlorine and a schematic of the chlorine feed system are also maintained on file and easily accessible by plan"

Included in the plan are detailed instructions for procedures in response to the accidental release of chlorine.  WTP employees are not to respond directly to the release but are to dial 911 to notify the Fire Department.  Other instructions related to the accidental release of chlorine include the following:\n\n-\tstart-up and shut-down procedures for the plant;\n-\tplant exit and escape routes;\n-\tlocation of equipment and supplies; and\n-\tchain-of-command, with 24-hour telephone numbers. \n\nAs a requirement of the RMP, different scenarios for the release of chlorine gas from the City's WTP to the environment were performed.  The release scenarios were modeled using Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) RMP*Comp model, and included both worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  The off-site consequence analysis has been removed from this document.\n\nThe City's WTP has had no accidents during the last 5 years.  In fact, the WTP has not had an accidental chemical release since the current chlorine feed system went on-line in 1976.  This success is due to the quality of the staff and the plant's existing accident release prevention program, which includes inspection and maintenance procedures for the chlorine feed system components.\n\nThe RMP specifies that WTPs must have a prevention program in place for each process.  For the City's WTP, chlorine gas is the only regulated substance and the chlorine feed system is the only regulated process.  Since the worst-case release scenario modeling results indicated that the public is within the potential effected area of a chemical release, the possible prevention programs available to the City's WTP included Program 2 (default program) and Program 3 (consistent with Occupational Safety and Health Association [OSHA] program).  Although the City's WTP could have sought coverage under the"

      "SummaryText": "less stringent Program 2, plant personnel choose to meet Program 3 to be consistent with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.\n\nProgram 3/OSHA PSM standards require implementation of a prevention program with several tasks.  The City's WTP has existing programs for several of these tasks including review of safety information, operating procedures, training programs, and equipment inspections.  As part of the RMP requirements for Program 3, the plant has developed written procedures for process hazard analysis, maintenance, management of change, employee participation plans, written competency testing for safe handling procedures, and hot work permits.  It is anticipated that these additional management and safety procedures will help ensure that the City's WTP will continue to maintain its perfect record of no chemical release accidents."
