Nevertheless, Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella\u2019s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella\u2019s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nSetton Pistachio of Terra Bella has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella now thinks of the RM"

      "SummaryText": "Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to each high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the reciprocating compressors.\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to the evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to each high pressure receiver. Each receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\n \nProcess Classification\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n \n(11) Rooms\n(2) Precool Rooms\n(1) Hallway\n(1) Shipping Dock\n \nRefrigeration System Equipment\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room. \n\nProcess Chemistry\n\nThe refrigeration system employed at Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella is a flooded system. In this system, high pressure liquid from each high pressure receiver is piped to multiple accumulators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator either feeds two ceiling suspended evaporator coils located in the North Hallway/Shipping Dock, or multiple bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Precool/Storage Rooms. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia."
