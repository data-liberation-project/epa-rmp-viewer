Our actions are guided by the Akzo Nobel Corporate HSE policy which states \u00bfConcern for health, safety and environment is an integral part of Akzo Nobel's\nbusiness policy.  Akzo Nobel actively supports the guiding principles of the Business Charter for Sustainable Development of the International Chamber of Commerce, the Responsible Care\u00ae program of the chemical industry and the Coatings Care\u00ae\nprogram of the paint and printing ink industry.\u00bf  Our commitment is further demonstrated by our certification to the ISO 14001 standard and additional efforts focusing on activities relevant to obtaining the RC14001 certification.  These efforts guide us in the development and implementation of a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.0  Primary Facility Activities and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Synthetic Resin Manufacturing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, that being Formaldehyde (solution).  Formaldehyde (solution) is used as a reactant in the manufacture of urea formaldehyde (amino) resins.  The maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (solution) at our facility is 132,000 lb..\n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary sourc"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years or whenever there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Akzo Nobel Coating Resins maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nAkzo Nobel Coating Resins has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided routinely as a part of ongoing operations.  Operating procedures are an integral part of batch reaction processing instructions and are modified as needed through technical and engineering review.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAkzo Nobel Coating Resins carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Ma"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Akzo Nobel Resins has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Akzo Nobel Coating Resins does not use contractors for normal maintenance activities or for operation of covered RMP processes.\n\n\n4.0  Five-year Accident History\nAkzo Nobel Coating Resins has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  There have been no accidental releases of covered hazardous materials during this period.\n\n5.0  Emergency Response Plan\nAkzo Nobel Coating Resins has in place a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.

These improvements include an increase in size of the passive containment system, installation of adequate agitation to insure uniformity of temperature, high and low temperature indicators and alarms, and high level alarms.  The installation of an additional manual shutoff device was identified during the most recent PHA as a recommendation to improve the safe operation of the tank system and to provide an additional margin of safety for our own personnel."
