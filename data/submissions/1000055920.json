Management and employees at the Charlestown facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of covered chemicals including propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage, trans-fill and distribution of propane cylinders. Propane is trans-filled from a bulk storage tank to portable cylinders, and cylinders are stored and staged for transportation.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario reports can be viewed at the facility and were prepared using RMP*Comp. Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These reduce the likelihood of a release and are also designed to reduce the magnitude of release should it occur. The mitigation methods include check valves, pressure relief devices, vents, grounding equipment, purge systems and written maintenance and operating procedures. \r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive plan compliant with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) designed to prevent accidental releases of propane. The program utilizes technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.\r\n\r\nEmployees are frequently consulted concerning various aspects of the program and process and are asked to provide input regarding safety and operational improvement.\r\n\r\nWritten process safety information was developed for the propane system to enable managers, supervisors and employees to identify and understand the process hazards. This information was utilized to conduct a PHA which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of a pro"

The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA will be updated every 5 years.\r\n\r\nDetailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be taken. The operating procedures are reviewed periodically and revised as necessary.\r\n\r\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contract employees. The training meets the requirements of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). The training also includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response, safety rules and procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization, and other pertinent process safety information. Training is provided to employees by traditional classroom and hands-on methods. Demonstrations, observations and written tests are used to evaluate employee understanding.\r\n\r\nA contractor screening process is in place to ensure contract employees hired to perform work can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and integrity of the covered process. The contractor program includes review of contractor safety qualifications and knowledge of the work being performed. \r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSSR) are used with new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability, quality and safety standpoint. PSSR recommendations are resolved prior to final installation or process start up. Items completed prior to the initial process start up include piping and instrumentation diagrams, operating procedures and initial employee training. \r\n\r\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process oper"

The maintenance program includes the required inspections/tests, the appropriate frequency, written procedures, and training of maintenance personnel, documentation of results and documentation of manufacturer recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nHazardous and non-routine work is controlled in a consistent manner. The hazards identified are communicated to all affected employees and appropriate control measures are taken to prevent an accidental release. The program references and requires lock out/tag out, hot work, elevated work, line breaking and appropriate authorizations.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed to review proposed changes to the covered process. MOC procedures include changes to equipment, processes or procedures that are not considered \"replacement in kind.\"\r\n\r\nProcess incidents that result in or could have resulted in a release are investigated and documented. The purpose of the incident investigation process is to ensure appropriate and adequate corrective actions are implemented to prevent a re-occurrence of similar incidents. Process incidents are investigated by a team that consists of management personnel as well as knowledgeable employees. All resolutions are communicated to affected employees.\r\n\r\nThe facility has an emergency preparedness/response plan. The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a release of propane. The plan complies with OSHA's Emergency Action Plan standard (29 CFR 1910.38) and has been coordinated with local emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\nThe facility receives an internal compliance audit at least once every 3 years.
