CONTAINMENT - All distribution/storage areas are inherently spill-containing.  The building walls also provide passive mitigation.  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - All employees are trained and qualified in safe handling of EHS chemicals.  MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE - Authorization is required for all changes affecting equipment, procedures, or facilities.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - Comprehensive plan includes employee training, fire and spill response equipment, on-site medical facilities, and procedures for facility drills.",

The facility is located on a 25-acre parcel in Phillipsburg, NJ and Lopatcong Township, NJ, and is comprised of about 60 buildings containing manufacturing operations, utility services, and warehousing.\n\nThe three EPA-regulated products are ammonia, pentane, and ethyl ether.

In the worst case scenarios, a catastrophic failure of the largest process vessel over a ten minute duration was considered and modeled at a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec in \"F\" class atmospheric conditions.\n\nToxics\nWorst Case - Anhydrous Ammonia\nA tank truck of ammonia ruptures catastrophically while unloading.  The truck discharges the entire 36,000-lb load in 10 minutes.  No emergency response is enacted, no safety devices function, and all of the material evaporates.  The EPA modeling techniques indicate a plume extending up to 2.3 miles.  There are approximately 53,000 residents in the included area.  Only a fraction of these residents would be affected in this unlikely event due to plume effects.\n\nAlternate scenario - Ammonia\nA transfer hose develops 1/4\" hole during truck unloading.  The release continues for 15 minutes until the operator activates the automatic shutdown system.  1,770 lbs are released.  The release plume is substantively reduced through the efforts of the response team, in combination with the installed water spray and foam vapor suppression systems.  The potentially effected radius under \"D\" class conditions and average temperatures is 0.10 mile.  There are approximately 0 residents in the included area.\n\n\nFlammables\nWorst case - Pentane\nA tannk-wagon of pentane ruptures catastrophically  while unloading.  The wagon discharges the entire 45,000-lb. load in 10 minutes.  No emergency response in enacted, no safety devices function, and all of the material evaporates.
