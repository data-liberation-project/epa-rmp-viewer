The Kenova Terminal is also evaluating the process emergency back-up power capabilities."

The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum-based additives.\n\nKenova LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment (HES) goes hand-in-hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention/mitigation and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances.\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs.\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated substances.\nD. An overview of the emergency response program.\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe butane blending process has been classified as Program Level 3. No Program Level 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of its flammable hazards , it's necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to employee health, and"

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Blending Process.\n\nButane Blending is a batch-type process based on seasonal regulatory Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports), stored on-site (a second vessel is being added to the process and is included in this RMP), and piped directly to injection points feeding the dock and off-site locations. Process safety controls include \"Smart-Hoses\", low emission couplers, emergency shutoff valves (ESVs) throughout (manual, automated and thermally actuated), vessel PRVs, excess flow valves, hydrostatic pressure relief, and process area hydrocarbon detectors along with on-site fire water monitors. Access to the Kenova LP Terminal and butane offload/storage area is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Kenova LP Terminal accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by butane to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Kenova LP Terminal:\n\n1) Employee Participation;\n2) Process Safety Information;\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\n4) Standard Operating Procedures;\n5) Training;\n6) Contractors;\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review;\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Inspection, Testing and Preventive Maintenance;\n9) Hazardous/Hot Work Permits;\n1"

MPLX and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures along with engineering and administrative controls to help identify/contain/control a release and reduce potential adverse impacts. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Redundant control/safety systems;\n-Manual and automated shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices and critical components;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n-Process shutoffs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible\nelements in the event of a fire);\n-Excess Flow Valves;\n-Hydrocarbon Detectors with automatic process shutdown functions; \n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n-\"Smart-Hoses\" with design break-away and self-closing valves on each end.\n\nGeneral Emergency Response\n\n-Emergency alert system;\n-Periodic emergency training for employees;\n-Communication systems with local emergency responde"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, a Facility Response Plan (SMARTPLAN) is in place for the Facility with response activities being coordinated with Kenova and Ceredo Fire Departments/Catlettsburg Refinery Fire and Rescue.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Kenova LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal maintains records for all incidental (including near misses) and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions. This is an existing Butane Blending process with additional storage capacity anticipated for 2024.  There have been no reportable (as defined in the EPA RMP regulations) accidents within the past five (5) years.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Kenova and Ceredo Fire Departments, the Catlettsburg Refinery Fire and Rescue and the Cabell/Wayne County LEPC. A Facility Response Plan (SMARTPLAN) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nThe Facility (Non-Responding Stationary Source) maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and 1st Responder Operations capability.\n\nThe Kenova and Ceredo Fire Departments/Catlettsburg Refinery Fire and Rescue and LEPC participate in annual butane coordination/training and notification sessions for this process.\n\nAddition exercises including Tabletop and/or Full-Scale are performed as agreed upon between responding agencies and the Facility.\n\nE.
