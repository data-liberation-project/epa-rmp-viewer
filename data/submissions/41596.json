In fact, we have a commendable safety record based upon statistics. Our goal is to not see a single employee injured, and that requires a constant vigilance by all employees.\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nLanXess Corporation has recently been formed.  Formerly a portion of the Bayer Corporation group, Lanxess has become a separate and intact company.\n\nLocated in the Bayer Baytown Industrial Park, Lanxess operates a facility which manufactures maleic anhydride (used in unsaturated polyesters for synthetic marble countertops, bowling balls, and in lubrication oil additives).   LanXess manages the operation which is staffed by Bayer MaterialScience operators and supervisors.\n\nThe Bayer Baytown Industrial Park is located in West Chambers County on 1,700 acres along Cedar Bayou.  The site is serviced by barge, rail and truck and has pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\n\nLanxess Baytown has one process covered under RMP.   The process also is a PSM- covered process and is considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management Program.\n\nThere is one chemical used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities defined in the RMP regulations: Butane.\n\nAt the time of "

Lanxess has made a decision to shutdown and dismantle one of the operating facilities.  Covered chemicals in that unit included ammonia and ammonia solution (>20%) which will no longer be on-site as of this submission.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe site is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Baytown Industrial Park site.  Action items that are identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll site personnel have access to the company?s electronic mail system and Intranet.  Chemical-specific information (Material Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHA?s) are conducted in each process.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHA?s.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures that address normal and abnormal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\nTraining:\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of t"

The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.  A safety steering committee and safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety, the safety of the Bayer facility and its employees. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.  Findings are addressed prior to startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to ensure that maintenance workers understand how to perform their duties safely to maintain the facility.  Specific instructions for testing and inspections are included.  Testing and inspections are conducted as scheduled and documented.  Maintenance and engineering follow established codes, standards and company guidelines.\n\nHot Work and Control of Abnormal Activities:\nControl of hot work and abnormal situations is conducted to ensure that work does not contribute to or cause hazardous results.  All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThe proper management of change generates appropriate assessment of possible impacts on the level of safety and health on an area.  All impacted documents and procedures are altered as required.  Appropriate personnel are informed regarding changes before they operate the new system.\n\nIncident Investigations:\nIncidents, injuries and near-miss situations are investigated.

Open action items are tracked through completion.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Programs \n\nAt the Baytown Industrial Park, accident prevention programs are required in each process.  Specific prevention programs include:\n\nDetection Systems:\nDetectors are in place for various toxic vapors (phosgene) and for hydrocarbons (butane).  Personnel wear dosimeters in the plant.  An LDAR program is in place.  Personnel conduct work area safety observations.\n\nRelease Control and Containment:\nSystems for emergency scrubbers and emergency vacuum neutralization are in place.  Remote-operated valves contain systems and processes.  Relief devices direct neutralization systems.  Steam-ammonia curtains surround operating areas.  Firewater monitoring systems are in place\n\nRelease Mitigation Systems:\nTrained emergency response personnel are in place and supported by external emergency response organizations.
