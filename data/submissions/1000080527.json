Subsequently, EPA promulgated regulations that apply to all stationary sources with processes that contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  This regulation \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) is intended to prevent accidental releases of substance that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposure and to mitigate the severity of releases that may occur.\n\n\n\nIn general, part 68 requires that if a facility stores or handles the regulated toxic or flammable substances is excess of the threshold quantities listed in the regulation that:\n\n?    Covered facilities must develop and implement a risk management program (RMP program) and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP program will include an analysis of the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response plan.\n\n?    Covered facilities also must develop and submit their initial risk management plan (RMP plan), which includes registration information, to the EPA no later than June 21, 1999.  The RMP plan provides a summary of the RMP program.  The RMP plan will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies and the public.\n\n?    Covered facilities also must continue to implement the RMP program and update the RMP plan periodically or when the processes change.\n\n\n\nThe phrase \"risk management program\", (RMP program) refers to all the requirements of the RMP regulations, which must be implemented on an ongoing basis.

The RMP regulations define the acronym RMP as the RMP plan.  However, to avoid confusion and for clarity RMP plan will be used in this document.\n\nThe Greensboro Olympic Products location falls under a Program 2 category.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require that the RMP program for covered facilities include the following:\n\n?    Hazard Assessment\n\n?    Prevention Program\n\n?    Emergency Response Program\n\n?    RMP plan submittal\n\nThe following sections briefly describe each of these requirements.  \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nAll facilities must assess the following:\n\n?    One worst-case release scenario representing all toxic substances held at the facility in excess of threshold quantities \n\n?    And one worst-case release scenario representing all regulated flammable substances held at the facility in excess of threshold quantities.  \n\n?    Program 2 facilities must also assess at least one alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance and one alternative scenario representing all flammable substances held at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities.  \n\nThe assessment includes dispersion modeling, identification of the area where off-site impacts are in excess of specified toxic or fire/explosion \"end-point\" criteria, and estimating the potentially affected public and environmental receptors.  The assessment also includes a 5-year accident history involving releases of regulated substances.\n\nEPA had defined a worst-case release as the release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  Passive mitigation (e.g. berms, dikes, drains) can be included in determining the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations specify many of the parameters to be used to estimate these distances, including meteorology, release height, liquid te"

They may be based on the accident history or process hazard analysis. While not explicitly stated, the intent is to select a credible alternative release scenario that provides a basis for planning on-site emergency response and off-site community response.\n\n\n\nTHE 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe 5-year accident history includes incidents from covered processes that resulted in on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nIn the previous 5 years, no reportable accidents have occurred at Olympic Products. However, on July 21, 2015 a railcar containing TDI-80 was in the initial stages of offloading. It was observed the threaded end of the transfer pipe was \"dripping\". The hose had been replaced approximately a week prior to this occurrence. Once this dripping was observed by the attendant, the pump was immediately shut off. TDI never reached the ground surface but stayed on the side of the rail car. The chemical was neutralized. The fitting was tightened and transfer began without incident. The estimated loss was approximately 1-2-oz. This incident, although being included, is not considered of a magnitude to qualify but is included only as a reference for the organizations records.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nOlympic Products, LLC believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, should be of the utmost concern in the operation of its business.

These include:  hazard review; operating procedures; training; maintenance; compliance audits; and incident investigation.\n\n\n\nOlympics' implementation of the Program 2 requirements is discussed in section 8 of this document.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBoth the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations rely mainly on previous requirements for emergency action plans and training (29 CFR 1910.38{a} and 1910.120 {a},{p}, and {q}). The RMP regulation continues to allow a facility to evacuate and not actively respond to accidental releases, provided that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under United States Code (U.S.C.) 11003 and that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.  While the RMP regulation allows the use of plans and programs developed under prior emergency response regulations, it stipulates that the plan include items required under the statute, notably procedures for informing the public and local responders about a release.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergenc"

The ALOHA model was originally developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (distributed by the National Safety Council) as an emergency response model.  Many LEPCs have traditionally used ALOHA for planning purposes.  However, for the most recent submittal and analysis, RMP*Comp&trade; was used to complete the Off-site Consequence Analyses.

Passive mitigation (e.g. berms, dikes, drains, etc.) can be included in determining the distance to the specified endpoint.   The RMP plan must contain one worst-case release scenario that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint to represent all flammable substances on-site.  Additional worst-case release scenarios may need to be evaluated if the release of a different toxic substance or flammable would have impacts on public receptors different from those defined above.  The RMP regulations specifically define how to determine the worst-case release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario selected for evaluation for TDI handled at the facility is the release of a 20,000 gallon railcar.

For the worst-case scenario, the maximum temperature in the past three years at the Greensboro, NC meteorological station of 100 &#730;F was used (2004).\n\n\n\nThe results showed a distance of  0.07 miles (1.1 kilometers) to the toxic endpoint for TDI.  There would be approximately 1,200 people impacted from the modeled railcar. The impact would be to schools, residences and recreational areas. This was determined by the Offsite Consequence Analysis-Worst Case Scenario, modeled by Golder Associates-See Risk Management Plan Submittal For The TDI System Sept 2014-093-9676014.  There would be no environmental receptors within the ring of the modeled railcar.
