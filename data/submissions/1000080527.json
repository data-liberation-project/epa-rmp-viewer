Subsequently, EPA promulgated regulations that apply to all stationary sources with processes that contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  This regulation Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) is intended to prevent accidental releases of substance that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposure and to mitigate the severity of releases that may occur.\r\n\r\nIn general, part 68 requires that if a facility stores or handles the regulated toxic or flammable substances is excess of the threshold quantities listed in the regulation that:\r\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities must develop and implement a risk management program (RMP program) and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP program will include an analysis of the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response plan.\r\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities also must develop and submit their initial risk management plan (RMP plan), which includes registration information, to the EPA no later than June 21, 1999.  The RMP plan provides a summary of the RMP program.  The RMP plan will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies and the public.\r\n\u00bf\tCovered facilities also must continue to implement the RMP program and update the RMP plan periodically or when the processes change.\r\n\r\nThe phrase risk management program (RMP program) refers to all the requirements of the"

The assessment also includes a 5-year accident history involving releases of regulated substances.\r\nEPA had defined a worst-case release as the release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  Passive mitigation (e.g. berms, dikes, drains) can be included in determining the distance to the specified endpoint.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations specify many of the parameters to be used"

Our management systems for our TDI processes address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\u00bf\tSafety information.\r\n\u00bf\tHazard reviews of our processes.\r\n\u00bf\tOperator procedures for transferring and storing TDI.\r\n\u00bf\tControls are in place to reduce the hazards of Isocyanate exposure to the employees, the    \r\n\u00bf\tcommunity and the environment.\r\n\u00bf\tProcess controls also exist to minimize potential releases (e.g. tank level gauges, high level alarms, high-pressure switches, rupture disks, and system interlocks).\r\n\r\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

These include:  hazard review; operating procedures; training; maintenance; compliance audits; and incident investigation.\r\n\r\nOlympic's implementation of the Program 2 requirements is discussed in section 8 of this document.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nBoth the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations rely mainly on previous requirements for emergency action plans and training (29 CFR 1910.38{a} and 1910.120 {a},{p}, and {q}). The RMP regulation continues to allow a facility to evacuate and not actively respond to accidental releases, provided that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under United States Code (U.S.C.) 11003 and that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.  While the RMP regulation allows the use of plans and programs developed under prior emergency response regulations, it stipulates that the plan include items required under the statute, notably procedures for informing the public and local responders about a release.\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. \r\n\r\nWe have coordinated our program with local emergency planning committee and the fire department. The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department have copies of an SDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits the plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release.

This was determined by the Offsite Consequence Analysis-Worst Case Scenario, modeled by Golder Associates (see Risk Management Plan Submittal for The TDI System Sept 2014-093-9676014).  There would be no environmental receptors within the ring of the modeled railcar.  ALOHA model printouts are included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\nThe RMP regulations require an alternative release scenario evaluation for each regulated toxic substance and at least one alternative release scenario evaluation to represent all flammable substances is included in the RMP plan.  Passive and active mitigation measures (e.g. shutoff valves, alarms, etc) can be included in the alternative release analysis.  The scenario chosen for inclusion in the RMP plan the five-year accident history and the process hazard analysis conducted under the Prevention Program of the RMP program was a break in a 2 flexible hose used to transfer the 65/35 TDI from the delivery truck to the tank\r\n\r\nThis equipment is located outside of the tank building. However, the liquid would flow into a containment dike. The spill would, therefore, be contained - the effect of the containment dike was included in the analysis. The estimated flow is 500 lbs/min. Due to the requirements that the offloading be manned at all times, the duration of the spill would not exceed a period of five minutes. Using RMP Comp, the initial transfer rate and other process parameters, as well as the five-minute release period, the estimated spill amount would be 27,550 lbs of TDI. As with the worst-case scenario release, the evaporation rate of TDI from the spilled pool of liquid was reported as a released rate to the air. Again, using RMP Comp, Golder determined the mitigated alternative release rate to be 0.16 lbs/min.  \r\n\r\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe facility has not had any accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths,"

ALHOA are different. However, each are acceptable under the requirements of RMP. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\nThe RMP program regulations define a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  Passive mitigation (e.g. berms, dikes, drains, etc.) can be included in determining the distance to the specified endpoint.   The RMP plan must contain one worst-case release scenario that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint to represent all flammable substances on-site.  Additional worst-case release scenarios may need to be evaluated if the release of a different toxic substance or flammable would have impacts on public receptors different from those defined above.  The RMP regulations specifically define how to determine the worst-case release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario selected for evaluation for TDI handled at the facility is the release of a 20,000 gallon railcar.  The railcar is located outside.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations specify the meteorological and other modeling parameters that must be used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenarios.  Table 5-1 summarizes these parameters.  The facility used the ALOHA model and guidance contained in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for each worst-case release scenario.  For the worst-case scenario, the maximum temperature in the past three years at the Greensboro, NC meteorological station of 100 &#730;F was used (2004).\r\n\r\nThe results showed a distance of  0.07 miles (1.1 kilometers) to the toxic endpoint for TDI.  There would be approximately 1,200 people impacted from the model"
