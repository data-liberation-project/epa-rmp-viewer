Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: At this warehouse and distribution facility we handle Propylene Oxide and Ammonia (anhydrous) which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  In such case this makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these products to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health as well as our employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we store these hazardous chemicals, combined with the safe handling procedures, and the training of our employees.\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency response agency.\n\n2.  The storage facility and regulated substances handled:  The primary purpose of this facility is to warehouse and distribute industrial and agricultural chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous, plus many non chemical items such as polyethylene sheeting, rope &  twines, vineyard and tree wire to both wholesale and retail customers.  The products considered hazardous by the EPA are,  (a)  Propylene Oxide which is packaged in 55 gal drums and is used by food processing plants as a commodity fumigant. (b)  Ammonia (anhydrous) which is packaged in 150 pound cylinders and is used in the refridgeration units at food processing and meat packing plants.  These products are delivered to our facility by trucks and stored inside are warehouse, or outside on our storage docks.  This facility has equipment for unloading trucks and loading trucks of all types and sizes.  Access to our fenced and gated property is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized mangement personnel and authorized customers.\n\nThe maximum amount of Propylene Oxide that can be stored at this facility is 71,000 pounds.\n\nThe maximum amount of Ammonia (anhydrous)  th"

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\nWorst case scenario-failure of our largest storage vessel (55 gal drum)  would release 366 pounds of Propylene Oxide.  The distance to the endpoint for the worse-case scenario is 0.30 miles.  It is very unlikely that we would have a worst case release since company policy requires only our trained employees to unload, handle, store, and load this product at our facility.                                                                         \n\nAlternative scenario #1.   Accidentally puncturing a drum with the tip of the fork on the fork lift, causing a small hole that could release up to approximately 30 lbs. of Propylene Oxide before the drum can be turned on it's side to stop the flow of liquid.  The distance to the end point for Alternative scenario #1 is 0.10 miles or less.\n\nAlternative scenario #2.  Recieving an Ammonia (anhydrous) cylinder, that is leaking at the valve packing nut. This could cause a small release of material approximately 0.1 lbs per minute.  This is very unlikely as the valves are tested for leaks after filling the cylinders at the manufacturer's facility.  The distance to the end point for Alternative scenario #2 is 0.10 miles or less.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:  This warehouse facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  All employees have been thoroughly trained and certified in thier specific job duties.\n\n5. Five-year accident history:  None\n\n6.
