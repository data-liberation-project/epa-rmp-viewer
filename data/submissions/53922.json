To meet this commitment, we have\nestablished systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper\nhandling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk\nManagement Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances. \nFAG's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's\n(EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management\nPrograms.  This regulation is also referred to as the RMP rule.  One of the requirements of the\nRMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan  describing\nthe RMP at our facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary\nrequirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \n\nFAG Bearings Corporation in Joplin, Mo. has a heat treat operation which utilizes propane that will be above the threshold quantity limit of 10,000 pounds.  This RMP along with the PSM plan presents a comprehensive program designed to reduce the potential for unwanted releases, fires, or catastrophic explosions of highly flammable chemicals.  The Propane is used as a fuel and atmospheric control for the Heat Treat system.  Design engineering led to the facility having four individual 1,000 gallon tanks connected and stored together to provide the Propane into Heat Treat.\nFAG Bearings / Joplin, Mo.  Risk Management Program consists of three elements:\n\n  1. A hazard assessment to identify (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental\n  releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the\n  substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive"

A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant\n  quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Section 4 of this executive summary);\n  and\n  3. An emergency response program to provide guidance to the plant for responding to accidental\n  releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule (see Section 6 of this\n  executive summary).\n\nAlthough the RMP helps ensure that FAG\u00bfs RMP covered system is maintained and operated in a safe \nmanner,  it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact, a comprehensive safety \nprogram exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used.\nWhen a regulated substance is used, the equipment that contains it is carefully designed, built, and\noperated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  All applicable federal, state, corporate,\nand industry standards are strictly adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the\nequipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release or fire.\nFAG's main objective is to prevent the accidental release or fire / explosion involving Propane from \noccurring.  In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize incidents, quickly \nassess the severity of an incident, and respond to mitigate the incident.  Coordination with the county's \nLocal Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) is crucial to protect the health and safety of the \nsurrounding community.  Emergency planning efforts have been performed and will continue with the \nlocal officials with Newton  County Emergency Services.  In short, actions have been taken to ensure \nappropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of an incident on our employees and the \ncommunity.\nFAG Bearings safety program consists of a number of elements, many of which are beyond what is\nrequired by the RMP rule.

All appropriate steps have been taken to prevent an incident involving Propane.  \nThese steps include (a) training programs for personnel, (b) programs to help ensure safety in the \ndesign, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process, and (c) programs to evaluate the \nhazards of our processes.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, FAG will be prepared to respond in a manner that will be\nsafe for our employees and will minimize any injury to the public and the environment.

REGULATED SUBSTANCE USED AT FAG Bearings / Joplin, MO.\nFAG Bearings has one substance (Propane) in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.  The \nPropane used at this facility is covered by the RMP rule.  As stated  previously, Propane will be used as a \n fuel and for atmospheric control for the heat treat process.\n\n3.

This process safety information is available to our \nemployees and contractors, as well.\n\n 4.1.2  Process Hazard Analysis\nProcess Hazard Analysis of the Heat Treat process involving Propane was performed and will be\n periodically updated to identify process hazards, as well as to establish recommendations that will\n improve the safe operation of the RMP covered process.  FAG established a group that  systematically \naddressed the hazards associated with operation of Heat Treat associated with Propane.  The team then \nprepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  \nResponsibility for resolving the recommendations was assigned to plant personnel, and, when \nappropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the system were implemented.  This analysis is revised at \nleast every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n 4.1.3  Operating Procedures \nFAG Bearings engineers, EHS, maintenance, operators, and management worked together to develop\n and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Heat Treat involving Propane \nshould be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as \nreference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n 4.1.4    Training\nEmployees are trained to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.
