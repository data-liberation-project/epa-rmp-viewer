Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined.\r\n\r\nDyno primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\r\n\r\nDyno periodically updates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nDyno maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Manager of Safety as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the Dyno operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The writt"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nDyno will investigate incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could result in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Dyno management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendation will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nDyno is a new site that has recently started operations; therefore, there are no relevant compliance audits to report at this time.  Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years to confirm the procedures and practices required by the chemical accident prevention program are being implemented. \r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained on-site. The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nDyno has in place safe work practices to sustain worker and process safety.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to foster that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nAdditional Safety Features\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. These features include but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n*  Operating parameter monitors with alarms\r\n*  Process relief systems\r\n*  Isolation valves (manual or automated)\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDyno is a new site that has recently started operations; therefore, there is no relevant accident history to report at this time.

This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\r\n\r\nTraining for process maintenance activities: The owner/ operator shall train each employee involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\n\r\nDyno makes use of established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures are used in order that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are completed to evaluate equipment functioning as compared to that intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Dyno incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nDyno has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

New employees receive basic training in Dyno operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nDyno uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Dyno has procedures in place to provide that contractors \r\n*  perform their work in a safe manner\r\n*  have the appropriate knowledge and skills\r\n*  are aware of the hazards in their workplace\r\n*  understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n*  understand and follow site safety rules\r\n*  inform Dyno personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with\r\n*  a process overview, \r\n*  information about safety and health hazards, \r\n*  emergency response plan requirements, \r\n*  safe work practices, and \r\n*  a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Dyno evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
