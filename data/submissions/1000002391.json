Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices\n\n\n To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods ALBERTVILLE, AL., this \n\n\nfacility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical \n\nProcess Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119. All operators of systems containing \n\nthe threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety \n\nManagement training and operator training specific to the system.  To insure proper \n\nresponse to emergency situations, Tyson Foods ALBERTVILLE, AL., has implemented \n\nEmergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations \n\n29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and \n\noperators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\nAt Albertville, AL., we use anhydrous ammonia for our refrigeration system. The maximum \n\ninventory is 32,949 lbs.  \n\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario A? \n\n\nThe Albertville, Alabama Poultry Processing facility has an ammonia high pressure \n\nreceiver as the single largest ammonia vessel.  The liquid-full capacity of the high \n\npressure receiver is 448.3 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia condensing temperature of 95 \n\ndegrees yields an approximate operating pressure of 181 psig and an ammonia liquid \n\ndensity of 36.71 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 448.3 cubic feet multiplied \n\nby the liquid density yields the ammonia capacity of 16,457 pounds.  Using RMP Comp with \n\nthe settings of ammonia liquefied under pressure, urban topography and no passive \n\nmitigation the distance to endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario A? \n\n\nTyson Foods has chosen the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve \n\nactivation.  Pressure relief valve activations historically have been the primary \n\nrelease type"

      "SummaryText": " within the company based on reports to Environmental Compliance.  The \n\nscenario chosen was based on a pressure relief valve activation resulting from over \n\npressurization of a condenser.    The valve modeled was a Refrigeration Specialties SRH3 \n\nwhich has an inlet port size of 3/4A? and an outlet port size of 1A? and discharge flow \n\nrating of 57 pounds per minute (air rating) which converts to 44.53 pounds per minute \n\nammonia at a pressure setting of 250 psig.  The typical release duration may not reach \n\nthe property boundaries of most Tyson facilities, though EPA requires the alternative \n\nrelease scenarios to reach the boundary.  Tyson chose the release duration of 5 minutes \n\nin an urban setting to yield a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles which reaches and \n\nexceeds the property boundary at the Albertville facility.  \n\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program\n\n\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical \n\nProcess Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk \n\nManagement Program 40 CFR Part 68. For ammonia systems, Tyson Foods Inc. has adopted the \n\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and \n\nmaintenance. Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series \n\nfor all operators augmented by Tyson Standards and Specifications for design, \n\nconstruction and maintenance of refrigeration systems.   \n\n\n5. Five-year accident history\n\n\nNo reportable accidents in past 5 years. \n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site. This team is trained to \n\nthe Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA \n\n29 CFR 1910.120 (q). The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both \n\nconfinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.  \n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been deve"
