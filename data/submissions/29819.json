ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nIPL recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe IPL PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The IPL PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based process rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\nIPL believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Operators and Maintenance personnel, will be deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they will assume a major responsibility for operating the ammonia process safely.\n\nThe IPL Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Pike Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee.  All IPL employees have received documented emergency action training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nIPL operates a Fossil Fuel Power Generating Station.  Ammonia is used to control NOx emissions in their stack gas.   Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in amounts above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of the Ammonia Storage Tank.  This maximum ammonia release from a ruptured storage tank was assumed to occur over a 10 minute period.   The distance of t"

      "SummaryText": "ravel for the generated ammonia vapor cloud has been calculated and the information is available from Plant Management.\n\nA WORST CASE release is very, unlikely to occur during the life of the facility, this is because of the release prevention and mitigation features incorporated in the IPL PSM/RMP program.\n\nAn alternative case release scenario that we call WORST CASE CREDIBLE was slightly more likely.  An ammonia vapor release from a failed pressure relief valve or from ruptured ammonia vapor piping was considered. Under worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .1 mile before dispersing in this scenario.   This release scenario is also very unlikely to occur during the life of the facility.\n\nA second alternative scenario was also considered which we call MOST Likely, MOST Severe. This scenario considered the release of a hundred pounds of ammonia from a ruptured ammonia loading hose during the tank fill area.  Ammonia released during this scenario would travel less than .1 mile.\n\n  \nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE IPL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIPL conducts an annual training and response exercise to practice, train and update the IPL Emergency Response Program.\n\nIPL conducts  triennial PSM/RMP compliance audits of the entire PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  IPL considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be a collection of living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\nIPL emphasizes and insists on employee participation from the ammonia system operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\nIPL provides a comprehensive, training program with full documentation specific training modules for each ammonia system employee.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage eit"

The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Pike Co.  Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIPL recognizes that, even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent, their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of living documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before Safety becomes second nature.\n\nIPL expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program:\n\n(1)   Employee Participation is the Key to a successful program.  Both the Maintenance and Ammonia System Operators will be deeply involved in verifying the P&IDs, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n(2)    The IPL PSM/RMP Program will increasingly become:  (a) computer based,  (b) user friendly,  (c) based on specific training by qualified trainers,  (d) revised and re-written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and   (e) revised and re-written to be understood and used by the operating level employees.\n\n(3)   All recommendations developed during the HAZOP were designed to improve the safety of the IPL facility.  IPL has evaluated each recommendation in a timely manner and has implemented those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
