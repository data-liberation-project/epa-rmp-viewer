These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.

The lead person or supervisor of the affected area, Human Resources, or maintenance personnel are to contact the Primary Incident Commander (IC).

The IC will determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action and should activate the evacuation alarm if necessary.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, first determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area.   The use of a blow horn and/or alarm horn/strobe will inform employees that they are to evacuate the building.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor.

If the entire charge were to release within 10 minutes, the distance to endpoint of the release would be 1.46 miles.\n\n\n\nThe scenario of a worst case ammonia release is unlikely due to the following reasons:\n\n\n\n1.    Worst-case weather conditions are uncommon.\n\n2.    Industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels.\n\n3.    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\n4.
