Is a public cold storage / frozen food facility. The prime Refrigerant used is Anhydrous Ammonia in a closely controlled and monitored environment. The Refrigeration system is Computer controlled with built in safeguards which is monitored 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year. The facility has personal on call at all times that are trained and qualified to handle any emergency situation that may arise. The system is monitored in each Room that the process takes place by a computer linked detection system. The machine room, where the compressors and vessels are located has an automatic venting system that incorporates a water curtain should an incident occur.\n     Ammonia is a self-alarming substance with a distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in health risks). The Department of Transportation classifies ammonia as a non-flammable. Ammonia will burn however, but only in a very narrow and high range of concentration with high temperature. \n     The U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) has made a determination on the permissible exposure of ammonia to people.

We have conducted our own modeling as guidance for this report. The RMP Ammonia Program Plan document was closely followed to ensure compliance.\n     As a result we have found that should a catastrophic incident occur. There would be very limited private residences in the areas of release.\nThe businesses that would be effected in the immediate area are on a call list and would be contacted by a designated person if an emergency would occur during normal business hours. The worst case release of Anhydrous Ammonia would come from a rupture of the high pressure vessel that is located in the machine room. The amount of the release in the study was 3,000 pounds. The release rate is 100 pounds of ammonia in a thirty-minute period. With a 1.5 MPH wind. The distance to the end point equals .7 mile. There are no Schools, Residences, Hospitals, Prisons, or Recreation areas within the scope of this model. There are however, Office and industrial Buildings in the effected area.
