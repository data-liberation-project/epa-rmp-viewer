The North Muskegon Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of North Muskegon, MI. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nThe North Muskegon LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe North Muskegon Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nA.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community along with the surrounding environment. MPLX - North Muskegon Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety/control devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the North Muskegon Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in two (2) storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to an injection skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the injection skid and analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fusible elements (fail safe valves), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, thermal and pressure reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the North Muskegon Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nMPLX's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by regulated substances to employees, the public, and the environment.
