TRANSFLO terminal provides transloading services between rail and truck transportation modes. TRANSFLO has been in operation at this facility for over 20 years and the facility is located at 601 N. Hoskins Road in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO's policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTRANSFLO trainloads vinyl acetate in rail-trucks in quantities in excess of 15,000 pounds which will exceed the 15,000 pound threshold quantity give in 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for Vinyl Acetate using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single rail car over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of this worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO facility has no passive mitigation. Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this worst-case scenario has the potential to result in an offsite release.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\nAlter"

      "SummaryText": "native Release Scenarios\n\nTRANSFLO evaluated several options to be considered as alternative release scenarios.  After careful consideration, Ingles decided to include one alternative release scenarios in their RMP document.  The alternative release scenario was developed for evaluation because they are expected to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe first alternate release scenario (Alternative Release Scenario 1) identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a transfer hose.  In developing the release parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered average response time to shut the system down.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp program and EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the toxic endpoint in either alternative release scenario has the potential to result in offsite consequences.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of vinyl acetate, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\nTRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) with incorporated safety measures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the vinyl acetate rail-truck.  TRANSFLO encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the facility.  Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, questions, or ideas.  TRANSFLO employees may approach their supervisor directly or place suggestions in the suggestion box for topics that require more immediate attention.\n\nTRANSFLO understands that maintaining the vinyl acetate transfer system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  The preventive maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  \n\nThe local fire department does not conduct formal audits; however, TRANSFLO occasionally invites the fire department to tour the facility.  In addition, the following agencies aud"

Mecklenburg County Department of Environmental Protection (MCDEP)\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, TRANSFLO has not experienced an accidental release of vinyl acetate.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTRANSFLO has documented emergency response procedures in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an offsite release.  Included in the emergency action plan are measures to be taken internally by TRANSFLO and procedures to inform local emergency response agencies.\n\nTRANSFLO has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental vinyl acetate releases and other emergencies.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  Three of these personnel are trained to the level of Incident Commander.  They will receive annual update training.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with TRANSFLO's emergency response procedures, copies of the emergency response document have been submitted for review and approval by the local agencies.  Mecklenburg County Local Emergency Planning Committee  (LEPC) has reviewed TRANSFLO's emergency response procedures.  In the event of a vinyl acetate release resulting in offsite consequences, the general public will be notified by the LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTRANSFLO has implemented a continuous training program to improve safety awareness."
