The water treatment plant has installed new\nautomatic shut off valves that will activate if chlorine gas\nis detected and new monitoring systems which will indicate\nthe location of a chlorine gas leak. All chlorine equipment\nis checked on a routine basis and serviced accordingly to\nmanufactures recommendations. Chillicothe Municipal\nUtilities is committed to provide a safe environment for the\nresidents of the City of Chillicothe. All water plant\npersonnel will be trained in chemical awareness and safe\nhandling of chemicals. The water treatment plant will\ncontinue to upgrade safety equipment as it becomes available\nto us.\n\nCHILLICOTHE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY AND THE REGULATED\nSUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Chillicothe Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant is\na 4.5 million gallon per day water supply for the city of\nChillicothe, MO. The source of water supply is alluvial\nwells. This water is of good quality but is highly\nmineralized. The treatment process uses calcium oxide (lime)\nfor removal of much of these minerals, commonly known as\nsoftening. Sodium Aluminate is added as a softening aid and\nfor clarification. Carbon dioxide gas is available when\nneeded to make the water non corrosive as it is delivered to\nconsumer. Chlorine gas is added in controlled quantities to\ndestroy any organisms that could cause disease. A fluoride\ncompound is added for the prevention of tooth decay. As a\nfinal process, the water flows through dual media filters\nfor removal of any suspended material before being delivered\nto the consumer. Chlorine gas is a regulated substance and\nthe water treatment plant has on site 6,000 pounds.\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nChillicothe's worst case scenario is a release of 2,000\npounds in 10 minutes. A total release would cover an area of\n0.90 mile. This"

The model plan used\nto determine the distance is the (EPA'S RMP*COMP)(TM)\nprogram.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nChillicothe's alternative release scenario is a release of\n900 pounds in 30 minutes. This release would cover an area\nof 0.01 mile. This release would have offsite impact. The\noffsite impact would be major industry. There would be no\nschools, prisons, recreation areas or residences in the\nalternative  release scenario. The model plan used to\ndetermine the distance is the (EPA'S RMP*COMP)(TM)\nprogram.\n\nThe safety equipment installed on the chlorination equipment\nwill automatically shut down if chlorine gas is detected in\nthe chlorine cylinder room or the chlorination room\neliminating the possibility of an undetected chlorine\nrelease.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nAs mentioned in the above paragraphs the Chillicothe water\ntreatment plant will begin intense training in chemical\nawareness and handling with all personnel. The water\ntreatment plant has install safety equipment that will help\nreduce the possibility of a chlorine release. New safety\nequipment will be installed as it becomes available.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nChillicothe  water treatment plant has had no accidental\nchlorine releases in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nChillicothe Municipal Utilities  Process Safety Management/\nWater Department                  Risk Management Program\nRevision No.\nDate April 13,1999\n____________________________________________________________\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that Chillicothe\nMunicipal Utilities maintains up-to-date and complete\nwritten emergency action plans (EAPs) and effective response\ncapabilities for all covered processes.

This procedure outlines Chillicothe\nMunicipal Utilities plan for updating and maintaining the\nexisting emergency action plans.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Plant Superintendent and RMP Program Manager will be\nresponsible for implementing and maintaining this procedure.\nEmergency action plan reviews and updates, and emergency\nresponse training will be coordinated by the RMP Program\nManager. Training will be scheduled and coordinated by the\nRMP Program Manager., Training will be conducted by\nqualified in-house staff or outside resource (i.e.,\nconsultant, vendor, or other experts).\n\nThe Plant Superintendent will ensure that the emergency\nresponse team is adequately staffed and the required\nequipment is supplied and maintained. The Plant\nSuperintendent will coordinate with the community response\norganization.\n\n\n\n  Updating Existing EAPs\n\nThe EAP will be reviewed annually to ensure that they are\ncurrent and comply with OHSA PSM and EPA RMP regulations. An\nupdated EAP will be prepared that will provide up-to-date,\nfacility-specific information and procedures in the\nfollowing sections:\n\n* Emergency evacuation procedures, routes, and safe assembly\npoints.\n\nImmediately evacuate all personnel by first moving at right\nangles to the wind direction until clear of the exposure\narea. Assemble at the power plant.\n\n* Procedures for recognizing emergencies, securing incident\nareas, and responding to releases and leaks.\n\nAn emergency situation will be when the automatic valves or\nthe manual valves do not shut the chlorine cylinder off.\nSecuring the incident area will be conducted by the police\ndepartment. Most of the incident area is owned by the City.\nAll personnel responding to a release or leak will meet at\nthe assembly po"

If patient is breathing place in a\ncomfortable position; keep warm and at rest until a\nphysician arrives. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.\nIf breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration,\npreferably mouth-to-mouth. In all above circumstances, call\na physician as soon as possibly. Rest is recommended after\nchlorine exposure.\n\n\nEye or Skin Contact: Immediately flush eyes with water (soap\nand water for skin) for at least 15 minutes, while removing\ncontaminated clothing. If irritation occurs, consult a\nphysician. Never attempt chemical neutralization! Do not\ngive medication except under specific instructions from a\nphysician.\n\nIngestion: Throat irritation: drinking milk may help relieve\nthe discomfort of throat irritation from chlorine exposure.\nCoughing: Hot coffee or tea is often used to alleviate\ncoughing induced by chlorine exposure.\n\nNotes to Physicians (including antidotes) Treat patients of\nchlorine overexposure symptomatically. Also, observe and\ntreat for possible onset pulmonary edema, which may be\ndelayed.\n\n* Procedures for notifying the public and local emergency\nresponse agencies of a release.\n\nThe operators first call from the assembly point will be to\nthe fire department to report a leak and secondly to the\npolice department to notify the public in our toxic zone to\nevacuate.\n\n* Reportable quantities of chemical and petrochemical\nproduct accidental release.\n\nA reportable chlorine gas release is 10 pounds.\n\n* Procedures for use, inspection, testing, and maintenanc"
