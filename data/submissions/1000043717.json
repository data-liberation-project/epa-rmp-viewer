This commitment is demonstrated by our excellent safety record. Programs in place cover areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Trained response personnel are on staff and ready to respond in the event of an incident.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facilityA\u00bfs primary activity is storage and handling of low temperature food products.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant to maintain the temperature of our warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nMaintaining the refrigeration system properly and ensuring that maintenance is performed in a safe and professional manner is the most critical part of preventing accidental releases. Operating and maintenance procedures have been implemented to help ensure this is done. \r\n\r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards are also very important in preventing releases. IIAR standards are reviewed to help identify potential problem areas, develop good management practices, and maintain our system in a manner that will provide the safest and most efficient operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance with PSM and RMP regulations is another important step in preventing releases. Zero Mountain, Inc. strives to meet or exceed all PSM an RMP requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of these programs:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nZero Mountain, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information t"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the A\u00bfWhat ifA\u00bfA\u00bf methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Zero Mountain, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process. SOP checklists are used to ensure all steps are completed properly, using all safety precautions and PPE.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nZero Mountain, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nZero Mountain, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; compressors, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nChanges to Improve Safety\r\nZero Mountain has implemented a program that will stop the flow of liquid ammonia to an area if the sensor in that area detects a release. This system is currently in place at all four of our locations and is tested regularly with the Nh3 sensors.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nNh3 sensors in the blast freezers to protect customer product and employees.  These Nh3 sensors are in place at the Fort Smith facility and will be installed in the future at the other three ZMI locations."
