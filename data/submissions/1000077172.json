Description of the Emergency Response Program \r\nSwiss Premium Dairy is utilizing the  Fire Department as the Hazmat first responder to an incident and has contracted a third party contractor to provide emergency response in the event of an uncontrolled release. Swiss Premium Dairy has an Emergency Action plan in place, which describes how the facility will respond to an ammonia release and other emergencies. The plan includes First Aid procedures, Emergency Medical Treatment procedures, Evacuation plans, Notification / Communication and Re-entry procedures, and Training and Drill programs.\r\n\r\nF.

      "SummaryText": "Swiss Premium Dairy operates a production facility where dairy products are processed, packaged, and distributed. We receive, store, and distribute dairy products.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation Program\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining Program\r\n\u00bf\tContractor Safety Program\r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity Program\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation Procedures"
