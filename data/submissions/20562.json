The tank sits on a solid concrete base within a concrete walled dike designed to contain the full contents of the vessel should a release occur.  The tank's actual operational storage content is maintained at 45,000 lbs. which is intentionally below its maximum design capacity.  The parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the cyclohexylamine source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic liquids.\n \nIn accordance with the Rule, the maximum 54,000 lb. full capacity contents of the vessel were assumed to instantaneously spill from the vessel and form a liquid pool within the surrounding dike.  The dike is defined in the RMP as a passive mitigation system.  The methodology recommended in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document was used to determine the volatilization of the liquid pool into the air as well as the distance traveled by the cyclohexylamine vapors before the concentration of the vapors decreased to an endpoint concentration of 0.16 milligrams per liter of air.  This endpoint concentration was selected by EPA and listed in the RMP Rule specifically for cyclohexylamine.\n \nUsing the EPA Guidance Document to determine the offsite impact of the Columbia Plant's worst-case cyclohexylamine release, it was found that there would be no cyclohexylamine vapor concentrations above the endpoint concentration that would leave the Columbia Plant property from such a release.  The nearest distance from the bulk cyclohexylamine storage tank, VT-902, to the Plant's property line is 620 feet.\n \nAs a result of these findings, the Honeywell Columbia Plant meets the eligibility requirements for Program 1 status under the RMP Rule and is not required to conduct the less severe alternative release scenario analysis.\n  \n \n4.

The five year accident history:\n \nNo accidental releases from the cyclohexylamine stationary source have occurred at the Honeywell Columbia Plant in the past five years.\n  \n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n \nThe Honeywell Columbia Plant has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's stationary source involving cyclohexylamine.  The Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental release of cyclohexylamine.  The Plan provides for both internal Plant and external community emergency alerting and notification with established call trees with multiple means of communication identified.  The Plan addresses emergency health care, inplace sheltering, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire District who would direct all offsite community response activities.  The Honeywell Columbia Plant maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases of cyclohexylamine.  The ERT holds annual Plant emergency response drills and exercises that have been conducted jointly with the local Fire District response group.  Annual in-house audits of the Plant's emergency response system are performed.\n  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n \nA process hazard analysis of the Honeywell Columbia Plant's stationary source of cyclohexylamine was completed in November of 1997.

Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.  The Honeywell Columbia Plant endeavers to accomplish this by sponsoring and regularly meeting with an established local Community Advisory Panel.   \n \nThe Honeywell Columbia Plant is a nylon resin and fiber manufacturing facility that has approximately 650 employees.   The products that the facility manufactures are used to make a variety of different types and styles of nylon carpeting, woven and knitted nylon performance fiber products, and a multitude of plastic products from automobile parts to food wrap films. The facility's nylon manufacturing process involves polymerizing a mixture of the raw material caprolactam and various additives.  One of the additives used is cyclohexylamine which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  The Honeywell Columbia Plant's storage and use of cyclohexylamine is present in more than the Rule's specified threshold quantity of 15,000 lbs., is defined by EPA as a covered process and is therefore regulated under the RMP Rule.\n \nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP rule, a description of the following seven elements is provided for the Honeywell Columbia Plant: \n\n1.
