The process at the Fortier facility that produces a regulated substance is methyl methacrylate.   \n\n\n\nMethyl methacrylate (MMA Process) is used to make many products such as plastics, floor wax and medical devices.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is hydrocyanic acid (HCN).\n\n\n\n68.155 (c) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n \n\nEvonik CYRO's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n\n\n-    EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n\n-    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\n-    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n\n-    Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\n-    Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards"
