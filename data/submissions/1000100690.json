(OTH) we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n?\tA description of our facility and the storage and transfer of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n?\tAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n?\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n?\tAn overview of our emergency response program\r\n?\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nOur public marine terminal stores and transfers a variety of chemicals. The facility stores the chemicals in pressurized tanks and transfers them to and from various transportation modes including tank truck, rail car, barges, and ships.  The processes are storage and transfer only.  There are two storage and transfer processes:\r\n\r\n?\tToxic and Flammable Storage and Transfer\r\n?\t1-Butene Storage and Transfer\r\n   \r\nThe systems and procedures for storage and transfer of 1-butene are specific to 1-butene. The systems for storage and transfer of other flammables and all toxics are the same basic design and use the same basic procedures.\r\n\r\nWe have identified the following toxic chemicals that have the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:"

Only a few of these chemicals are currently stored at our facility.\r\n\r\nWe have identified the following flammable chemicals that have the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: 1-butene, isoprene, 1-pentene, 1,3-pentadiene, isopropyl amine, and MOTO-Mix (special fuel mixture). Several of these chemicals are presently stored at our facility. Since MOTO-Mix is a specialty mixture of various components, the hazard evaluation was conducted using isopentane as the chemical for radius impact calculations.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment in the storage and transfer of these chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: Process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit procedure and contractor safety.\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n1.\tAll tanks are pressurized with two levels of pressure relief with the first relieving to an abatement device at 80% of design pressure.\r\n2.\tTemperature, pressure, and level instrumentation including alarms.\r\n3.\tTanks are equipped with automatic shutdown of inbound flow upon detection of a high level in the storage tank.  The shutdown valve can also be activated by"
