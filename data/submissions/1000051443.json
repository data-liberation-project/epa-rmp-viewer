This facility is strictly a retail storage facility.  This current RMP is submitted as a Program 3 due in whole to OSHA's July 22nd, 2015, rescission of an exemption given to retail fertilizer facilities from the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management.\r\n\r\n1)  The Facility Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of K & B Ag Supply, LLC, are committed to the prevention of any accident releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Linn County Emergency Management Agency, the LEPC, the Fairfax Volunteer Fire Department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2)  Facility Information\r\n\r\nThis facility was decommissioned in 2007 when all anhydrous ammonia storage tanks were removed from the facility.  The current facility is a re-introduction of anhydrous ammonia bulk storage.  The sole process occurring at this facility will be the storage & handling of anhydrous ammonia for retail sale to farmers as a crop nutrient.\r\n\r\n3)  The Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n4)  The Emergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nThe facility has:\r\na)  a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\r\nb)  provided state and local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA);\r\nc)  responses will be coordinated with Linn County Emergency Management / LEPC (PBX: 319-892-6500) and the Fairfax Volunteer Fire Department (PBX: 911).\r\n\r\n5)  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility is newly constructed under current IDALS regulations & ANSI standards.
