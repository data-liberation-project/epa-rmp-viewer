It was constructed for Target Corporation; Target assumed responsibility for the building June 1, 2008. Prior to that date, Ryan Companies managed the construction, startup, daily maintenance, and operation of the facility. \r\nSince initial construction, installing additional banana ripening rooms have been the only significant addition to the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\nTarget manages the Process Safety Management Plan in accordance to all federal, local, and state regulations.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system and other equipment is an ever present risk to the health of team members and the community. Target is committed to safety at every level. Target's prevention solutions include both technology as well as an active business unit that is qualified to monitor and manage the refrigeration and PSM program.\r\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP) are living documents, defining the administrative and operational processes relevant to the ammonia refrigeration system.  Target reserves the right to modify and adapt its PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our business processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs is to minimize or eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\r\n- Human error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems.\r\n- Human error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system components.\r\n- Lack of knowledge regarding ammonia refrigeration system"

In general, element guidelines describe the following:\r\n- Functions of individual elements.\r\n- Repeatable processes to be followed.\r\n- Utilization of employee resources.\r\n- Contingency plans for emergencies.\r\n- Measures to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.\r\n- Method to evaluate risk associated with ammonia refrigeration systems.\r\n- Maintenance and update of PSM elements.\r\n- Provisions for feedback and continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nThe program is complex and has been developed by integrating facility safety programs with maintenance management, facility operations, and human resources management.\r\n\r\nTarget is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, covering design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Target has proactively partnered with Lake City Fire Department and Florida Emergency Services to ensure that properly trained and equipped hazmat responders are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release. \r\n\r\n2.
