      "SummaryText": "Ponderay Newsprint Company (PNC) owns and operates a newsprint mill, at 422767 SR 20 in Pend Oreille County at Usk, Washington.  Production facilities include a chip unloading and handling facility, a 610 T/D thermo-mechanical pulp mill, a 120 T/D waste paper recycling facility, and one paper machine producing approximately 700 T/D of standard newsprint.  Auxiliary facilities include primary and secondary effluent treatment, a propane-fired steam boiler rated at 180,000 lbs./hour, and a fluidized bed boiler rated at 40,000 lbs./hour.\n\nPNC is committed to protecting people and the environment.  As the company was formed, the leaders developed Philosophy Statements to guide business decisions.  One of these is \"We want to ensure a clean, safe work environment through attitudes, awareness, training, promoting safe work habits and by complying with all government regulations.\"  Another states: \"We want to operate our facility in a manner that will protect the environment.\"  PNC has implemented an environmental management system modeled after the ISO14001 standard.  The policy is to use current best management practices to minimize the possibility of an accidental release of a hazardous material.  In the event of an accidental release, active mitigation would take place immediately by a trained emergency response team that is maintained on-site 24 hours/day seven days/week.\n\nPNC has only one substance (Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous) regulated under the Risk Management Planning Standard (40 CFR 68 section 112(r)).  \nSulfur Dioxide is typically delivered by railcar and unloaded to the process.  This chemical is used to generate a brightening agent used in the pulping process.\n\n? In the unlikely event of an accidental release, our on-site Hazardous Materials Response team will respond immediately to the area to conduct active mitigation procedures.  PNC's HazMat team is also trained as an industrial fire brigade, confined space rescue team, and medical response team.  The team "

      "SummaryText": "conducts routine drills on responding to many types of emergency situations including Sulfur Dioxide release scenarios.  The team also participates in regularly scheduled joint training drills with local emergency response agencies.  Many members of the team are also members of their local volunteer fire departments.\n\nAlthough there are contingency plans in place should an emergency situation arise, the prevention of releases of hazardous substances to the environment is of the utmost importance.  There are many processes in place, which are designed and implemented to prevent emergency situations from occurring.\n? Area teams (made up of operators, a manager, electrical & instrumentation technicians, and mechanical maintenance technicians) actually \"own\" the Sulfur Dioxide system.  They have identified critical pieces of equipment in each area and maintain written preventative maintenance plans for that equipment.\n? There are detailed operating procedures and rigorous training and certification standards for all operators.  This ensures personnel operating the Sulfur Dioxide process are fully certified.\n? The Sulfur Dioxide system is inspected daily by a certified operator.\n? The higher risk processes of connecting, disconnecting, and energizing SO2 unloading lines is strictly controlled through detailed operating instructions, periodic training and auditing.\n? Preventative maintenance activities are scheduled and monitored through a computerized work order system.  These activities assure the mechanical integrity of the Sulfur Dioxide system as well as the calibration of critical instrumentation.\n? A safety inspection of the Sulfur Dioxide system is done every six weeks as part of the mill safety inspection program.\n? An internal audit process is maintained to monitor adherence to operating procedures as well as safety policies, environmental policies, and legal requirements (Process Safety Management system, etc.).\n? A change management system ensures any change t"

      "SummaryText": "o the Sulfur Dioxide process is thoroughly researched and documented.  Training on process changes is an important part of this system.\n? All Sulfur Dioxide lines are purged with air and the Sulfur Dioxide is neutralized in a caustic tank prior to opening any piping.  This minimizes incidental releases to the environment.\n\nPonderay Newsprint Company believes the safety of employees, neighbors, and the protection of the environment is very important.  Another of the Philosophy Statements reads: \"We want an organization that is recognized as a good neighbor.\"  Safety and environmental aspects are considered in all decisions.  Improvement in performance is \"built in\" to management systems. Ponderay Newsprint continually looks for ways to improve processes to make them safer and more environmentally friendly."
