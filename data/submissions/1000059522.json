As part of this 5 year update, UPI has included the following:\n\n- Following a significant incident at a source, the 5-year accident history information will be updated within\n\nsix months to reflect the incident.\n\n- If the emergency contact at the source changes, the RMP will be updated within one month, to include the\n\nnew emergency contact information.\n\n- The emergency contacts email address has been included in this RMP submittal.\n\n- The purpose for the RMP submissions has been included 5year re-evaluation and re-submittal to EPA.\n\n- Name, address, and phone number of the contractor used to complete the RMP submittal has been\n\nincluded and updated due to office change.\n\n\n\nSite Description & Regulated Substances\n\nUSS-POSCO Industries (UPI) is located at 900 Loveridge Road in the city of Pittsburg, California approximately\n\n1/2 mile north of Highway 4. The UPI property occupies approximately 490 acres. It is bordered by the New\n\nYork Slough of the San Joaquin/Sacramento River on the north and by open space and industrial facilities in\n\nall other directions. The nearest residences are located approximately 3/4 miles to the southwest of any\n\nfacilities handling chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nThe plant employs approximately 640 people. The operating divisions within the UPI facility include: the Rolling\n\nDivision,  Sheet Division, Tin Division,  Reliability Division, and the Technology, Environmental & Safety Division.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and liquid hydrogen are the only two federally and state regulated substances present\n\nat UPI.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form, under pressure, in an outdoor 28,0000 lbs. supply vessel. The\n\nvessel sits on a concrete pad that is surrounded by a locked fence.\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia stored in the supply vessel is less than 50% of the vessel capacity, by\n\nvolume.

A low level alarm to alert both the Supervisor and Supplier that Hydrogen is needed is installed on the tank, and set to 3\" W.C.\n\n\n\nManagement System:\n\nUPI has developed a formal management system for planning, organizing, implementing and controlling the\n\nrisk management program elements. This management system is consistent with the recommendations\n\ncontained in CCPS Plant Guidelines for Technical Management of Chemical Process Safety. This management\n\nsystem satisfies the requirements of the RMP EPA 40 CFR Part 68.15  and ensures that the risk management\n\nprogram elements are developed, implemented, and continually improved.

These  individuals are responsible for developing and maintaining policies and procedures for each risk\n\nmanagement program element that meet program goals and objectives.\n\n- Implementing - Detailed responsibilities for program implementation may be delegated to other individuals. Such individuals are trained on their responsibilities, and the corresponding procedures, before they are\n\nallowed to perform their responsibilities. Strict adherence to procedures is emphasized. Refresher training is provided on an as-needed basis.\n\n-Controlling - Member"

All records associated with the prevention program elements are retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified in the RMP EPA regulation, to permit periodic, comprehensive audits. Weaknesses in\n\nprogram elements, or in their implementation, that may be discovered during internal audits or reviews are corrected.\n\n- UPI utilizes a shared drive to store all of its RMP and CalARP documentation. The UPI employees responsible for the Risk Management Program elements have access to the shared drive.  This shared drive has been instrumental in helping UPI keep all of the requirements in one location for our employees, via a secured shared drive with limited access.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nMany of the processes, including the RMP covered processes are also regulated under the Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR Part\n\n1910.119. The release prevention program at UPI was developed to prevent onsite and offsite impacts to\n\npeople and the environment. Therefore, this facility has developed a release prevention program to comply\n\nwith both the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the OSHA PSM requirements. The release\n\nprevention program includes the following elements: Management System, Hazard Assessment, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre Start Safety Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Safety Permits (Hot Work & Confined Space), Contractors, and Emergency Planning & Response.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program elements represent an integrated system of administrative controls intended to\n\nensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.

These safeguards prevent, detect, or\n\nmitigate the effects of accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nEmployee training is also a major focus at UPI. UPI believes that employees who clearly understand how to\n\nsafely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents, and increase\n\nefficiency. Therefore, a thorough training program focused on specific operating procedures and safe work\n\npractices is a key element of our effective prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployees involved with operating & maintenance of the process receive training on the hazards associated with the process, how to operate the process within safe operating limits, and how to handle potential emergencies. The training program satisfies the requirements of the RMP EPA 40 CFR Part 68.71. The training is comprised of the following:\n\n- Initial all new employee awareness training.\n\n- Operator & Maintenance personal training.\n\n- Training provided in response to equipment or process changes, as identified under the MOC program;\n\n-Periodic refresher training; and\n\n- Training documentation.\n\n\n\nAll operators and maintenance personnel who work within the covered process receive initial training in safe work practices and basic operating principles prior to assignment.\n\nThe operators and maintenance personnel receive training specific to the operations of the process once they are assigned.
