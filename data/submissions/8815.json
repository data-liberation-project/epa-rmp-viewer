Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:                      At this manufacturing facility, we use anhydrous ammonia as an atmosphere   modifier for an  in-line brazing furnace.  The ammonia is fed into a disassociator and   ---separated into nitrogen and hydrogen gas with  the balance oxygen vented to the atmosphere.  The nitrogen and hydrogen are the fed to the furnace to maintain an inert atmosphere.\n   The process equipment associated with the anhydrous ammonia is located away from areas normally occupied by employees and is designed to run automatically with little employee interaction.\n   Our emergency response program is based on applicable Federal and State regulations, 29CFR 1910.38(a) in particular.   Certain parts of 29 CFR 1919.120(a), (p) and (q) may also apply.  This program includes close coordination with the City of Searcy Fire Department HAZMAT team and the local Office of Emergency Services. \n\n2. The  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe purpose of this source is to provide feedstock to the ammonia disassociators.  At no time during the process is ammonia exposed to the atmosphere.\n7 The regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia CAS# 7664-41-7\n7 The storage vessel is a 10,000 gallon above ground steel tank.\n7 The maximum capacity of the tank, according to the manufacturer, is 26,500 pounds  and is not to be exceeded.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n7 Worst -Case Scenario:   Complete failure of the storage tank would cause the release of  a maximum of 26,500 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the tank would be released in a period of 10 minutes.\n7 The toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.14mg/l at  a distance of. 2.9 miles\n7 Alt"

      "FacilityID": 8815,
      "SummaryText": "ernative Scenario:  A pull away at the filling port is assumed to release ammonia for 5 minutes until the free flow valves function to stop the flow.  The release rate of 293 pounds per minute results in a toxic end point of 0.14mg/l at 0.3 miles.\n\n4. Accidental  Release Prevention and the Specific Prevention Steps.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable states codes and regulations.  The storage vessel complies with the following standards and codes: Section VII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code  and API Standard 620.\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History.\nThis facility has had no accidental releases from this process with in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency response program.\nOur emergency response program is based on the OSHA Emergency Action Plan in accordance with 29CFR 1910. 38(a)  and is coordinated with the City of Searcy Fire Department  and the local Office of Emergency Services.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\nManagement is actively exploring alternatives to the process which makes anhydrous ammonia a necessary material at this facility.   A feasible alternative , if implemented, will eliminate our use of ammonia entirely."
