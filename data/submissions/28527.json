EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\na.\tThe City of Arcadia Water Treatment Facility (WTF) facility was installed to treat well water for providing potable water to Desoto County, City of Arcadia service subscribers.  The facility is located at 645 Turner Road (27\u00b013\u00a214\u00b2 North Latitude and 81\u00b050\u00a230\u00b2 West Longitude) and includes a chlorine storage area containing liquid chlorine containers, chlorinators, and various types of related safety equipment as well as process treatment tanks and equipment.  A maximum of four (4) one-ton containers of chlorine are found in the chlorine storage area (two on-line and two for backup.)  The facility is staff 16 hours a day 7 days a week on site with on-call coverage 24 hours a day, and qualifies as a Program 3 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\nb.\tThe City of Arcadia accidental release prevention program at the Turner Road facility involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and adheres to all applicable procedures of EPA.  The City of Arcadia emergency response program is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program (\u00bfERP\u00bf) requirements.\n\nc.\tThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst-case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release.\u00bf  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the\u00bfmaximum quantity in the largest vessel\u00bfis released as a gas over 10 minutes,\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\u00bf\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00bftoxic endpoint\u00bf selected by EPA of 3 parts per million (\u00bfppm\u00bf), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (\u00bfERPG-2\u00bf).

In a plume footprint representing 6.25% of the total potential impact area, the estimated affected residential population would be 365 people.\n\nii.  The alternative release scenario involves an accident resulting in the breaking of a regulator from a one-ton container connected to the chlorination system.  The potential chlorine released would be 2,000 lb over 5.8 minutes.  In acceptance of Exhibit 4-12 criteria, typical meteorological conditions of an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3 m/s were used.  The estimated distance to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was 0.3 miles.  The estimated population affected was 533 within a full circle of 1.5-mile radius and 34 within the plume footprint.\n\t\nd.\tThe City of Arcadia accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00b7\tHigh level training of the operators\n\u00b7\tPreventive maintenance program\n\u00b7\tUse of industry standard process and safety equipment\n\u00b7\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n\u00b7\tPerformance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\n\n\u00b7\tTraining in the practices of safe chlorine handling\n\u00b7\tThe availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators \n\u00b7\tAwareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n\u00b7\tPresence of chlorine detectors.\n\ne.\tNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.\tThe Turner Road facility has an emergency response program, which includes emergency response training of personnel, establishment of specific procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release, and coordination with the Desoto County Fire Department."

The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n\n(a)\t It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.  The 3-ppm one-hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten-minute release time; the value obtained is 7.3 ppm.\n\n(b)\tOnly the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6.25% of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily maximum temperature (96oF), and average relative humidity (74%) were inputs for analysis of the toxic endpoint presented.\n\nWhen the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and calculations based on Chapter 4 of the EPA publi"
