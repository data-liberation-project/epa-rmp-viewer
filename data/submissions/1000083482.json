      "SummaryText": "frigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator for Process 2. In Process 2, any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator or header, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the reciprocating/screw compressors.\r\n\r\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to an evaporative condenser where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n \r\nThe ammonia detection system was installed in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE 15, ANSI/IIAR 2 and the Uniform Mechanical Code at the time of construction.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, River Island Fresh has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 River Island Fresh, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that River Island Fresh has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name               |   Process Chemical     |   Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nNorth System Refrigeration |   Anhydrous Ammonia    |   12,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The ECB is installed on the east wall of the machinery room and contains three (3) valves.\r\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\r\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\r\nValve #3: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\r\nOpening Valve #1 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #2 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #3 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Control Box is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\r\n\r\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.\r\n\r\nEach reciprocating compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.\r\n\r\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, River Island Fresh has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, River Island Fresh now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
