      "SummaryText": "We at Oxarc, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to emplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of the regulated substances.  \"A\" and \"B\" kits are available for containment in case of a gas leak.\n\nOur facility's primary function is the production and distribution of industrial gases.  We have two regulated substances, chlorine,  and sulfur dioxide, present at this location.  The maximum amounts stored are 50,000 pounds of chlorine and 18,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is stored in 150 pound cylinders and ton containers; sulfur dioxide in two five thousand pound tanks and in 150 pound cylinders.\n\nSulfur dioxide is transfilled into cylinders from the five thousand pound bulk tanks through a closed system.  Chlorine is received and stored in pre-filled cylinders.  None of the chemicals are used at our facility.  The accidental release program for chlorine  centers around the proper and safe handling of cylinders and containers.  Additionaly, the program for sulfur dioxide also includes the receipt of bulk deliveries and the proper filling of cylinders from the bulk container.  Proper equipment is provided and training such as forklift operation is documented.\n\nThere has been no accidental release during the previous five years.\n\nOxarc has a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes provisions for notification of neighbors and emergency response agencies, evacuation,and  first aid and medical treatment.  The plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place."
