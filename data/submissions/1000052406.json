      "SummaryText": " additive manufacturing facility that manufactures, stores, and distributes a number of materials used by the farming industry and other uses.  The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is ammonia solution >20% concentration (NOT anhydrous ammonia).  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nAccident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping, manufacturing and storage. This starts with receiving  aqueous ammonia in DOT approved tank-trailers and then transferring the product into a 12,500 gallon, carbon steel aboveground storage tank (AST).   Unloading activities are conducted in a coated concrete containment area that will catch any accidental spills. The ASTs are located in concrete containment basins that are equipped with high level indicators to help prevent accidental overflow.  All tanks, piping and containment areas are constructed and maintained in accordance with Minnesota Rules (?7151) and/or the requirements set forth in the facility's Aboveground Storage Tank Permit (if applicable).  Prevention continues by having employees trained in proper handling procedures and using unloading checklists. Employees are also equipped with proper equipment to safely store raw materials and manufacture and package additives for customer delivery. Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program. We also follow industry standards, such as those of the National Association of Chemical Distributors to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nAs a result of our diligence, there has not been an accidental release from ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at this facility since the start-up of operati"

Don proper personal protective equipment, stop the release, make necessary notifications and clean up the release.\n\n2. Call the local fire department for hazmat assistance.\n\n3. Evacuate to a safe distance.  \n\nThe local fire department has toured the facility and is aware of the chemicals on site.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nWhile Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than continued compliance to industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Zero Can Be Done\".\n\n"
