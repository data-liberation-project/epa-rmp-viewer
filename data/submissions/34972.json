Preston WTP chlorine system is provided below. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the EPA\u00bfs Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe MDWASD emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored, to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.

Preston WTP also supply chlorine for the Hialeah WTP.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the John E. Preston WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\nThe vapor pressure of the stored chlorine forces the liquid through the tubing and into the manifold system.  Downstream of the manifold system there is a pneumatically actuated shut-off valve.  Pressing one of the emergency shut-off switches manually closes the shut-off valve.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator room.  The liquid chlorine flows through the shut-off valves to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important  safety features are (1) shut-ff valves and (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system.

Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIn 1997, detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorine system equipment and procedures to further assess the integrity of the chlorine system for the preparation of this RMP, checklists were used to assess the overall general condition of the chlorine system operation and maintenance, including human factors that affect personnel performance and system integrity.  The PHA(s) was updated again i"

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of water borne disease in drinking water.  The are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consist of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The chloramination process lowers the trihalomethane levels in the finished water.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in the finished drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The John E. Preston WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals, including ammonia as seriously as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n- Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\n\n- General Facility and regulated substance information.\n\n- Summary of the accidental release"
