The Facility Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Satanta Cooperative Grain Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n1. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n2. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n3. Then maximum quantity stored would be 167000 pounds in our two storage tanks.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario.\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car ) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 167000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint  ( dispersion to 200 PPM ) is 2.32 miles.\n\n4. The Alternative Release Scenario.\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 PPM ) is .83 miles.\n\n5. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\",  published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n6. The Five -Year Accident History .\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydr"

The Emergency Response Program.\nThe facility has: \nA. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38 ;\nB. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training;\nC. Provided State and Local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required.\n\n8. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\nSafety improvement and training is an on going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by the company Safety Director, as well as the State of Kansas Industrial Safety & Health Section, Kansas Dept. of Ag , as well as other State and Federal agencies to asses in the maintenance of our company safety programs, safety training and over all plant conditions.  \n\nThank you,\n\nNathan Holman\nSafety Director"
