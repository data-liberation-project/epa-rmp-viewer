Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of U.S. Steel (USS) Gary Works management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 in conjunction with OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to USS employees, the public and the environment.  \n\nThis objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  U.S. Steel's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.  Further, the Gary Works recognizes that it has a duty to protect its employees and neighbors from the effects of all dangerous chemicals.  \n\n2. Facility Description\n\nU.S. Steel operates one of the world's largest integrated steel mills at Gary, IN.  Operations include  the production of coke, iron, steel and a multitude of finished and semi-finished products. The Steel Works is bounded on the North by Lake Michigan and on the South by the City of Gary.  A variety of industries (including power plants and chemical companies) are found in the immediate area surrounding the facility.\n\nThe No. 2 Q-BOP typically uses natural gas for tuyere cooling purposes. The propane gas is used as a tuyere coolant on a supplemental basis for selective grades of steel. The propane is brought into the plant by transport trucks carrying liquid propane at an elevated pressure. The liquid propane, stored at the tank farm, is pumped  to a  Vaporizer near No. 2 Q BOP. At the vaporizer, the liquid propane is steam heated and converted into propane gas that is sent to furnace tuyeres.\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or connected piping that contains a regulated substance.  The release event is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\n\nUSS performed that required modeling for the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios.  Per a directive from EPA, this information is not included in the Executive Summary.  The specific information is included in Sections 4 and 5 of this RMP*Submit 2004 file.  \n\n4. Program Level Identification\n\nThe EPA Risk Management regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as \"programs\".  EPA recognizes that some regulated processes would not pose an off-site hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program 1.  Program 1 is applicable to any process for which it can be demonstrated that the public would not be adversely affected by a release.  Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.\n\n* no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury, environmental damage, significant property damage; and \n\n* dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case  release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the endpoint.\n\nThe Gary Works has not had an accident or release involving propane in the past 5 years.  However, the worst-case release, as defined by the regulation, results in an overpressure at some potential public receptors that exceeds the flammable substance endpoint.  Accordingly, the RMP for propane"

      "SummaryText": " has been  classified as a Level 3 program since May 2000 when the original RMP was submitted. As an ongoing U.S. Steel commitment to improvements in safety and security, additional site control measures have since been introduced that may effectively restrict public access to potential zones defined by flammable substance endpoints.  A study has been initiated to examine the implications of new measures and review existing safeguards. The intent is to render an opinion for the applicability of Program 1 instead of the current Program 3. A new RMP, per 40 CFR 68.190 (7), shall be submitted within six months if a determination is made to change to Program 1. In the meantime, the Propane system shall continue to be treated as Program 3.\n\n5.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nGary Works is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the Gary Works, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n? 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n? 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n? 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n? 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in US Steel's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of employees.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by USS management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing any findings from the propane system hazards review. USS Gary Works employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nU.S. Steel 's policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safet"

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards for fire prevention and protection.\n? National Electrical Code (NEC) Standards for the design standards of electrical systems.\n? American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) Standards for pressure vessel design.\n? Indiana Codes and Standards for pressure vessels\n\nUSS Gary Works is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, USS conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems that they are responsible for.  Gary Works also maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.  Members of the Gary Works emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History\n\nUSS has not had an incident in the past five years involving propane at the Gary Works that has caused any of the following:\n\n? On-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, or \n? Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n7.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nUSS has committed to performing a thorough review and implementation of management of change procedures before any change in the system is authorized.  Any results and recommendations from hazard reviews are discussed with management and implemented as deemed appropriate.  This is one of many methods used by the Gary Works to maintain and improve the safety of associated systems."
