KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Trilla Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and stored until it is loaded on trucks for distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Trilla Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility; however, it is used strictly as a fuel and is therefore exempt from RMP reporting pursuant to 40 CFR 68.126.  The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00bfOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and reg"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and constant emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having continuous pilots.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system and the flare system by having a backup power generator.\n\u00bfProviding emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00bfInstalling safety interlocks to stop product movement upon low pressurization.\n\u00bfInstalling seal fail switches which stop product movement in the event of a pump seal failure.\n\u00bfInstalling cameras to monitor the facility locally or from remote locations.\n\u00bfProviding emergency air escape packs at critical points throughout the facility.\n\u00bfConducting preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program to help ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00bfRequiring trucks to have a brake interlock system that helps prevent a truck driver from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconne"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Coles County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the Sarah Bush Lincoln Hospital, Ameren CIPS (the utility company), and the Illinois State Highway Patrol.  The Trilla Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the EHS&T Management System, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions are designed to ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, t"
