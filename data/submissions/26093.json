Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at the Grimmway/Malaga Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  Substance one is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 137,652 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo evaluate worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA\u00bfs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the EPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.  For alternative release scenarios we have employed the EPA\u00bfs RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involving Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia refrigeration system in Building 3.  In this scenario, 8,770 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from a liquid recirculating unit.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimate"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system in Building 3.  The scenario involves the release of 4,125 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous).  The liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as an enclosure are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nThe Grimmway Frozen Foods Inc./Arvin Organics Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals"
