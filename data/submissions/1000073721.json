The facility stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  In addition to petroleum storage, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline which requires compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations since butane is stored at an amount greater than threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe previous RMP was completed by the previous owner; and although there have been no changes to the process, different company philosophies between the previous owner and Magellan resulted in different volume calculations for section 1.17 and the Worst and Alt Cases of this PHA re-validation.   \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RELEASE POLICIES\n\nMagellan has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  Resources have been and will continue to be invested in accident prevention including personnel training, procedure development, design standards and preventative maintenance.\n\n\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, the LEPC would be contacted and requested to respond to the emergency.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\n\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e include those utilized as the safeguards in the PHA.  There could potentially be other process controls used in the process.  The process does not have any trade secrets.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Atlanta Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  There have been no accidental releases of butane from the butane process at the Atlanta"
