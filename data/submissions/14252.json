If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company , or other authorities, to mitigate any release an minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received  and used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop porduction nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 150000pounds  in a rail car.  The maximum amount handled would be 150,000 lbs from unloading a rail tank car.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a rail car released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 150000 pounds, which represents the largest volume of storage at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint  is 1.13  miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .41 miles.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implementd the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\" published by ANSI and the standards of the US OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia  in the past five years that:\n\n-  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n-  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths,  injuries, evacuations,  sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSH standard,"

Periodic evaluation  are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
