The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Gateway Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 193,000 pounds in the facilities 2 tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are 26,000 gallons and 18,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario NOT DISCLOSED\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario NOT DISCLOSED\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with  the Rules and        \n     Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure \n     Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations \n     Administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI \n     K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous \n     Ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n      \n      There have been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered  \n      Process in the past five years.  The release was 680# and it did not cause any deaths, injuries, or significant\n      Property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted\n      In any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or \n      environmental damage.\n\n6.
