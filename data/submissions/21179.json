Box 106, Hornick, Iowa 51026\nFor Locations at:\nBlencoe, Correctionville, Hornick, Moville, Pierson, Sloan, Washta\n\nExecute Summary\n\n1. Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The primary activity of our propane facilities is the storage and resale of propane to our member patrons.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in heating and grain drying.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) varies by location:\n\n            Tank Size (gallons)    Pounds\n              100 %                          85 %\nBlencoe, IA        30,000            131,325                \nCorrectionville, IA     25,000            109,438            \nHornick, IA        11,000             48,152\n            11,000             48,152\n        12,000             52,530\nTotal        34,000            148,834\n\n          8,000             35,020\n\nPierson, IA        12,000             52,350\n            30,000            131,325    \n    Total        42,000            183,675\n\nSloan            25,000            109,438\n\nWashta        18,000             78,795\n            12,000                   52,350\n            12,000             52,350                    42,000            183,495\n    \n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n\na.     The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 183,675 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as lim"

The distance to the endpoint for anhydrous ammonia (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 8.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint for propane (point of dispersion to 1 psi) is .3 miles.\n\n4.      Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n    \nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous \nAmmonia\".

No deaths, injuries, environmental damage or property damage occurred, except to our storage tank and the railroad car.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has had no accidental releases of propane in the last five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; not to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program.    \n\n        Western Iowa Coop has:\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right to Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CR 12910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Western Iowa Coop.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional new specific anhydrous ammonia or propane recommendations for implementation at this time. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
