      "SummaryText": "Gavilon manufactures ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer as 10-34-0 or 11-37-0 by combining super\n\nphosphoric acid with ammonia vapor. The reaction occurs by combining the ammonia vapor and\n\nsuperphosphoric acid in a simple pipe reactor. After combination, a reaction occurs which releases \n\nheat (with temperatures of 575?F to 650?F) and produces a highly polymerized, partially neutralized \n\n\"melt\". The heat of reaction causes several chemical changes to occur.  First, water is removed as \n\nsteam, and phosphorus atoms in the super phoshoric acid combine to form polyphosphate molecules. \n\nSecondly, the anhydrous ammonia reacts with these molecules (i.e. polyphosphate molecules) to \n\nproduce the ammonium polyphosphate melt.\n\n\n\nThe highly polymerized, partially neutralized \"melt\" formed within the pipe is discharged into a hot well\n\nwhere it is dispersed, dissolved by the addition of water and neutralized with aqua ammonia to a final pH of\n\n6.15 - 6.30 and a specific gravity of 1.395 - 1.420 @ 100?F (depending upon the final product). It is then\n\ncooled evaporatively by recycling through a tower packed with pall rings and collected at the base in the mix\n\ntank. The product, containing 60-80% polyphosphates, is then pumped through a heat exchanger that is also\n\nused to vaporize the reactant ammonia and cool the product to below 100?F. It is then routed to storage.\n\n\n\nAt the Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC - Nickerson facility, Gavilon maintains a 30,000 gallon ammonia storage tank.  \n\nThe ammonia storage tank and associated ammonia handling equipment are subject to 40 CFR, Part 68 Chemical \n\nAccident Prevention and 29 CFR, Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n"
