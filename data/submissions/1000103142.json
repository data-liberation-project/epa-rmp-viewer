Currently, no employees operate the system. They monitor and report to the refrigeration contractor. \nManagement of Change - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \nPre-Startup Review - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\nMechanical Integrity - Whole Foods has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented.  \nContractor Qualifications - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Whole Foods and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\nIncident Investigation - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each in"

This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68.\n\nII.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Whole Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Whole Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Whole Foods policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. This RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Whole Foods has developed an Emergency Action Plan that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nIII.\tFacility Identification\nThe Whole Foods facility is located at 716 East 111th Street in Chicago, Illinois. The NAICS code for the facility is 49311 - Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage. \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule.
