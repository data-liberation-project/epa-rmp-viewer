The storage vessel is constantly monitored by operators for ammonia leaks and has continuous monitoring electronic leak detection equipment with control room alarm monitoring the annular space between the double wall for ammonia leaks.  Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity.  In the event of a long-term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared; sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish; or consumed in the granulation plants.  In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike completely surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety.  There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation.  A series of relief valves connected to a flare also protect the tank from overpressure.\n\nOther smaller pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessels in the ammonia plant have relief valves that are piped directly to a flare system or vented to atmosphere.  Other ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.  There are also automated shutdown systems for the anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant at the site.\n\nChlorine cylinders are provided by vendors who are required to maintain and inspect their mechanical integrity prior to shipping.

Five -Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.  On July 31, 2000, the Ammonia Plant experienced an explosion and fire incident resulting from a process line failure.  No injuries or off-site impact resulted from this incident, it had significant economic impact only.\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nMosaic Phosphates Co., Faustina facility maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated and other substances, including the possibility of ammonia releases, chlorine releases, fire or explosion.  \n\nMosaic Phosphates Co. Faustina facility is located in St. James Parish Louisiana and is also very close to Ascension Parish.  When an emergency situation arises requiring outside assistance, Faustina's overall emergency response program is coordinated with the St. James Parish Emergency Operations Center (St. James EOC).  Via this organization, Faustina works closely with other emergency response organizations including the sheriffs of both parishes, St. James and Ascension Parish emergency response personnel, Louisiana State Police and Prevost Memorial Hospital in Donaldsonville.

The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, natural gas mixtures (flammable), air and steam.  In the ammonia plant, a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air is used to manufacture anhydrous ammonia with carbon dioxide as a by-product.  Some of the anhydrous ammonia produced is then separated and stored for use in the granulation plants. In the granulation plants, phosphoric acid is reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce granular monoammonium phosphate and / or diammonium phosphate.  Chlorine is used for water treatment in the cooling towers associated with the utilities area.\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in these processes include: anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine, which exceed the threshold quantities at the Faustina facility. Regulated flammable substances involved in these processes that exceed threshold quantities include the flammable gas mixtures reacted and generated in the ammonia plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated storage tank surrounded by a dike.  In addition to the anhydrous ammonia manufactured in the facility's ammonia plant, the Faustina facility also receives anhydrous ammonia via an underground commercial pipeline, as well as by ship and barge at the facility's river dock on occasion.  Chlorine is brought into the facility in multiple cylinders by trucks.  These cylinders are then individually connected to the process. Natural gas is received at the facility by an underground commercial pipeline that is connected by piping to the ammonia plant.\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, chlorine and flammable mixtures are regulated as highly hazardous chemicals under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina facility, the Faustina facility"
