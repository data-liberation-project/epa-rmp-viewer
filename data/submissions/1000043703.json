This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nPatriot has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nPatriot's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Patriot is Rick Vondra, General Manager - Vice President. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are below:\n\n\n\nVince McCabe, EHS Manager\n\nWork:     (309) 935-5700\n\n24-Hour:  (309) 945-6809\n\n\n\nDave Gerhart, Plant Manager\n\nWork:     (309) 935-5700\n\n24-Hour:  (309) 940-9463\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nPatriot ethanol plant is located in Annawan, Henry County, Illinois. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week f"

      "SummaryText": "or the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank. The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, 97,200 pounds, creating a vapor cloud. A determination spreadsheet is included as part of this documentation detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 5.6 miles radius and are also provided as part of the documentation. The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  Public receptor information was obtained using CAPS. Elm Island Ditch, Coal Creek, Hickory Creek, Hennepin Canal, Mud Creek, Dow Lateral, Mineral Marsh Ditch, Barbara Ditch, Abbott Ditch, Graddett Ditch, Shabbona Special Ditch, Goose Pond Ditch, Kuhn Ditch No 2, Mineral Marsh Nature Preserve, Bureau County Ditch, Harrison Ditch, King Creek, Johnson-Sauk Trail State Recreational Area, Broadbent Lateral are located within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n  \n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in a 200,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire conte"

RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.6 mile radius and are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tank contents, (equaling 1,120,000 pounds of the flammable mixture) only 380,800 pounds were used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Public receptors information was obtained using facility knowledge. Hennepin Canal and Graddett Ditch was located with the worst case distance to endpoint for denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia: The alternative scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternative duration is assumed to be 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and a wind speed of 3.0 m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.4 miles and are provided as part of this documentation. Public receptor information was obtained using facility knowledge. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations"

      "SummaryText": " - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were 0.2 miles and are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents (42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture) only 14,280 pounds were used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Public receptor information was obtained using facility knowledge. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of denaturant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Patriot facility qualifies as a Program 3 for anhydrous ammonia, the facility includes the flammable mixture as a Program 3 for RMP/PSM purposes for consistency throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nPatriot's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations.  Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports filed per IEPA requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with RMP covered processes at the Patriot facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nPatriot ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  Patriot has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the faci"
