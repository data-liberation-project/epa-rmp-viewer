The emergency response program:\n\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Henderson Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \n\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur.  Alert systems within the facility consist of word of mouth and by handheld cellular phones. \n\nF.
