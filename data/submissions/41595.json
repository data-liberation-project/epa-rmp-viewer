Chemical Handling, Hazard Communication, and Waste Management training are also provided throughout the year for new and existing employees. \nThe regulated substance requiring HS to sumit a RMP is propane. There are four 18,000-gallon propane tanks situated in the same area. The first tank contains high purity propane which not only supplies fuel to be used for heating, but also as a feedstock for a carburizing process and therefore falls under the RMP regulation.  The next three tanks are interconnected and provide standard grade propane which is used only as a fuel for equipment such as heaters and powered industrial trucks.\nBoth release scenarios were calculated using worst case situations. No active or passive mitigation measures were included. This enables HS to project a true worst case scenario in order to better understand the ramifications on the facility and the public. The worst case release scenario mandated by the EPA is a vapor cloud explosion and was calculated using EPS's RMP* Comp \u00bf software. The endpoint used, per EPA's guidance, was 1 pound per square inch. This resulted in a on-site impact distance to endpoint of 0.50 miles. The conservatively estimated residental population is 25. Public receptors include the residences and the lower portion of an airport terminal. A recreational park located on HS's site was included as a receptor even though the park is infrequently utilized by the public. There are no environmental receptors. The alternative release scenario is tank overfilling resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and was calculated using EPA's OCA Guidance. The distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles. There are no public or environmental receptors.\nThe prevention program consists of a properly equipped tank system per National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 58 LPS Gas Codes. Each tank is individually equipped with pressure relief valve"

      "SummaryText": "Hamilton Sundstrand (HS) is located in Windsor Locks, CT and is owned by United Technologies Corp. (UTC).  The 254 acre facility is located half way between Hartford CT and Springfiled MA. The site is secured by 6-foot high fencing and a 24-hour security staff which restricts public access.\nHamilton Sundstrand is an aerospace company which includes the design and manufacture of air, spacecraft and marine control systems and components. Products include environmental control systems, fuel control systems, propetter assemblies, electronic components, electrochemical cells and testing equipment. Wastewater from these processes are treated by an on-site, world class, wastewater treatment facility. HS has received excellence awards from UTC and Connecticut Business & Industry Associations for Environmental, Health & Safety (EH&S) management and continuous improvement. HS has also received registrations under ISO 9000 Quality Management Systems and ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection presented HS with a Green Circle Award for achieving ISO 14001 registration.\nAn EH&S Oversight Organization representing all HS operating and functional units provides strategic direction for the EH&S initiatives. EH&S professionals have been assigned to provide technical support to each operating center within HS to ensure day to day compliance with EH&S regulations. In addition, the managers of each operating unit within HS are held accountable for compliance with EH&S regulations. A Safety Culture Grass Roots Team was estabished to ensure that safety was a first priority in day to day activities. Any new chemical or process proposed for the site must first be approved by the EH&S Department. All containers of virgin chemicals are labeled with either the manufacture's label or, if the chemicals is transferred to a secondary container, with a hazard communication label indicating the hazards and proper personal protective equipme"

An alarm system and a deluge system are provided which signal the on-site Emergency Services Department if an emergency has occurred. All loading and unloading operations are performed under the supervision of qualified HS associates. The tank system is located in an area not frequently traveled which greatly minimizes the chance of an ignition source such as a passing vehicle, and all equipment is properly grounded.\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years, however, there are procedures to be followed if an emergency does occur. HS has an Integrated Contingency Plan which describes actions to be taken in the event of a spill, fire or medical emergency. The facility has an on-site Emergency Services (ES) Department with a full time fire/security staff supplemented by a volunteer fire brigade. 300,000 gallons of fire stand pipes feed the fire pumps with make up coming from the Metropolitan District Comission potable water system. The ES Department manges the upkeep and maintenance of the fire systems. In the event of an emergency the ES Manager acts as the Incident Commander. Arrangements with outside agencies include the town fire department, police department, spill contractors and local hospitals. In the event an outside agency is called for asistance, the town fire deparment will act as the incident commander and notify the public for action to be taken. All ES responders are trained in hazardous operations emergency response, confined space entry and rescue, incident command, and are certified as emergency medical technicians by the State of Connecticut Department of Public Health and Addiction Services Office and Emergency Medical Services. Evacuation drills are performed each year."
