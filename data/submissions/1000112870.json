The US Nitrogen facility manufactures liquid ammonium nitrate solution using natural gas as the primary feedstock for the anhydrous ammonia process. The facility has four high-pressure storage vessels which store 1,600,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia storage vessels supply feeds to both the nitric acid plant and liquid ammonium nitrate plant processes.  Also, USN distributes anhydrous ammonia to customers when extra stock is available.\n\nUS Nitrogen has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage anhydrous ammonia at the facility. Austin Powder Inc. and US Nitrogen's executive management teams have committed to full implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) programs to prevent the release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe facility is subject to EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM requirements for anhydrous ammonia. \n\nA PSM Compliance Manual has been developed for the facility. Key items included in the manual are:\n\n*\tWritten site-specific procedures for Employee Participation, Mechanical Integrity, \n        Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Internal \n       Compliance Audits.\n\n*\tTraining on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Lockout Tagout, \n         Emergency Response and Incident Investigation.\n\n*\tConducting Process Hazards Analyses for the ammonia processes\n\n*\tEmergency Response Plan (ERP)\n\n*\tOperator training and certification\n          \nThe Operations Manager and Operations personnel annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/RMP regulations. \n          \nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, USN has implemented a number of systems to ensure the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia, including:\n\n*\tAmmonia storage vessels ha"

The Operations and Maintenance staff have been trained to the Hazmat Technician standard, which allows our own employees to be able to provide an immediate response in the event of a release or spill of a hazardous material onsite.  If outside emergency services are needed, the Greeneville Fire Department's Hazmat Team is available and knowledgeable of USN's processes and hazardous chemicals onsite.  US Nitrogen maintains communication with the Greene County Director of Emergency Management to ensure that communication plans exist to alert residences that may be impacted by a release. Response Drills and exercises are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local Director of Emergency Management.\n\nIn addition to PSM, the organization has an active safety program. US Nitrogen has dedicated environmental, health and safety (EHS) staff that manage the EHS programs at the facility.  US Nitrogen has a Safety Committee that continuously emphasizes safety. The committee holds regular meetings to review new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.  Safety trainings are completed by all employees, at least monthly, via a Learning Management System, hands-on, and/or classroom.  Also, EHS audits are conducted regularly in the field to ensure employees follow the EHS Programs."
