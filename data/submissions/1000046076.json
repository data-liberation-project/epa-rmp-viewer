As part of this commitment we have established a system to promote the safe operation at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\r\n\r\nThe RMP at this facility consists of three (3) elements:\r\n\r\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand: The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and Accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the use substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\r\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\r\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\r\n\r\nThis facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards or controls against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage to its employees, the public and the environment. We limit the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\r\nThe safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

HAZARD REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe facility conducts a comprehensive hazard review to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. This review identifies the hazards of the regulated substance and process; possible equipment failures or human errors that could lead to a release; safeguards used or needed to prevent failures or errors; and steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases. A checklist analysis technique is the primary tool used to perform these evaluations. The hazard reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. The team may make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. This list of findings and recommendations are then reviewed for necessity and feasibility by local and corporate management and a decision for each recommendation is documented.

This facility implements reasonable prevention programs to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at this facility.\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, we control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment. This facility coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThis facility is primarily involved in the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream. As part of this process, we handle several regulated, flammable substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. There are no such quantities of regulated toxic substances handled at the Plant. The following RMP-regulated flammables are found at the Plant:\r\n\r\nEthane\r\nMethane\r\nPropane\r\nIso-Butane\r\nButane\r\nIso-Pentane\r\nPentane\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility uses a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

OPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThis facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n4. TRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, this facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees first receive basic training in gas plant operations and then are paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. To ensure training is adequate and serves the safety of employees, operators are consulted with on the type and frequency of their training.\r\n\r\n5.

INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nIncidents are promptly investigated that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.
