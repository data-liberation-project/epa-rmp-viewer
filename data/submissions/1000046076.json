As part of this commitment we have established a system to promote the safe operation at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\n\n\nThe RMP at this facility consists of three (3) elements:\n\n\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand: The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and Accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the use substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\n\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards or controls against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage to its employees, the public and the environment. We limit the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nThe safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. There are other prevention programs that are company specific and those required by the Department of Transportation under parts 192 or 195 and OSHA under the PSM re"

This facility implements reasonable prevention programs to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at this facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment. This facility coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThis facility is primarily involved in the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream. As part of this process, we handle several regulated, flammable substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. There are no such quantities of regulated toxic substances handled at the Plant. The following RMP-regulated flammables are found at the Plant:\n\n\n\nEthane\n\nMethane\n\nPropane\n\nIso-Butane\n\nButane\n\nIso-Pentane\n\nPentane\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility uses a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Our Program 2 prevention program, which applies to this plant, consists of the following seven (7) elements:\n\n\n\n1. SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nWe maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of our processes. These documents address:\n\n\n\na) Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, including regulated substances in covered processes.

HAZARD REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a comprehensive hazard review to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. This review identifies the hazards of the regulated substance and process; possible equipment failures or human errors that could lead to a release; safeguards used or needed to prevent failures or errors; and steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases. A checklist analysis technique is the primary tool used to perform these evaluations. The hazard reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. The team may make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. This list of findings and recommendations are then reviewed for necessity and feasibility by local and corporate management and a decision for each recommendation is documented.

Also, the hazard review is updated every fifth year or whenever a major change in a process takes place, whichever occurs first.\n\n\n\n3. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThis facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n4. TRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, this facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees first receive basic training in gas plant operations and then are paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. To ensure training is adequate and serves the safety of employees, operators are consulted with on the type and frequency of their training.\n\n\n\n5. MAINTENANCE\n\n\n\nThis facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain its equipment in a safe operating condition.

INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nIncidents are promptly investigated that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future hazard reviews.\n\n\n\n7. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, this facility periodically is audited to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both Operations and Corporate staff personnel may participate as audit team members.

Several safety features are utilized in the facility including:\n\n\n\na) Release detection-hydrocarbon detectors with alarms;\n\nb) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\nc) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\nd) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure and temperature)\n\ne) Release mitigation: Fire extinguishers for incipient fires \n\nNote:  Our employees are trained to fight small fires or initiate an ESD only.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis facility has not experienced an incident that meets the criteria for inclusion in the five-year accident history section of its RMP.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility maintains a written emergency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies. It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service. The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions.
