The facility possesses no more that 14 one ton cylinders for both the covered processes at any time. The chlorine is used as a biocide. Chlorine has been used in accordance with the facility's safety procedures without incident.\n\nThe chlorine processes at the Pinellas County Waste-to-Energy Facility are subject to OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM). Compliance with PSM requirements as supplemented by the RMP specific requirements are the basis for the facility's accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe response program includes notification of Pinellas County's HAZMAT team located at the Pinellas Park Fire Department in the event there is an incident or release of chlorine. Personnel at the facility are trained on the notification procedures.\n\n(b) The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nRESPONSE: Pinellas County Waste-to-Energy is a resource recovery facility operated by Veolia Environmental Service Pinellas, Inc. that converts municipal solid waste into electrical energy through a combustion process. The sole regulated substance subject to RMP requirements is chlorine as define in (a) ablove.\n\nC) The worst case release scenario and the alternate case scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\nRESPONSE: Chlorine cylinders are located at two sites.

      "SummaryText": ") cylinders are located at the cooling tower and ten (10) are located at the Pond Pump Station Chlorination Building. The worst case scenarion for the 4 cylinder location locatied at the cooling tower is the release of the contents of one cylinder of chlorine. Using this scenario, the end point distance from the cylinder location is 0.9 miles. According to Landview and the 2000 census data, there could be as many as 1,359 people within the affected area. The alternate case scenario for the 4 cylinder location is the release of the contents of a single cylinder with a toxic end point of <0.1 miles. The 2000 census data indicates that there are no affected residents within the vulnerable zone of this release.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the 10 cylinder location is the rupture of a single cylinder. With a 10 minute release for the entire contents of the cylinder, the vulnerable zone would be 0.9 miles with an affected population of not more than 1,359 based on the 2000 census data. The alternate case scenarion for the 10 cylinder location would also be the release of the entire cylinder contents over a 60 minute time frame. The vulnerable zone would be <0.1 miles with no affected population based on the 2000 census block data.\n\nMitigation and administrative controls in place for the facility provide for the safe use of one ton chlorine cylinders in accordance with the standard operating procedures as established by the Pinellas County Waste-to-Energy Facility.\n\n(d) The general accidental release prevention program and the chemical specifc prevention steps.\n\nRESPONSE: The general accidental release prevention and the chemical specific prevention steps include:\n1. Conformance with the safety procedures established for chlorine use at a site including compliance with OSHA 1910.119, Process Safety Management.\n2. Training all affected personnel on the safe use of chlorine.\n3. Inspection of all chlorine cylinders as they are received and installed into the system; d"

The PPFD would be the responding agency to any chlorine release.\n\n(g) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nRESPONSE: All changes to improve safety at the facility would include, but not be limited to, updates of the safety plan, updates to the standard operating procedures, following the changes and updates made by the Chlorine Institute and our chlorine gas supplier."
