This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \r\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \r\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of aerosol cans.  We have 2 \r\nregulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\r\nmethyl] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used as an aerosol propellant.  Propane \r\nis used as an  aerosol propellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \r\nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \r\nlimit the distances for each reported scenario to perform the required offsite consequence \r\nanalysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The \r\nconsequences of these scenarios are contained in section 4 and 5 of the RMP.\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\r\n                Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \r\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

These procedures address various \r\nmodes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency \r\nshutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The \r\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nFull-Fill Industries, LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that \r\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated \r\nwith these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more \r\nfrequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nFull-Fill Industries, LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process \r\nequipment to ensure proper operations.
