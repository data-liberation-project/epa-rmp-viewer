      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nTechnic Engineered Powders (Technic), a private corporation, is one of the largest global producers of metal\r\nparticulates for the photovoltaic and electronics industries. At its 300 Park East Drive facility in Woonsocket, Rhode\r\nIsland, metal powders and flake are manufactured for the electronics, electrical, jewelry, aerospace, medical, and\r\ndental industries. The 93,000 sq. ft. Technic facility is situated on a twelve-acre plot in an industrial park, with a\r\npredominantly rural surrounding. The closest residence, closest commercial/industrial establishment, and closest\r\nnavigable water body are all located approximately 0.1 miles from the site.\r\nTechnic operates one RMP covered process, which involves the storage, distribution, and processing of a 28%\r\nsolution of aqueous ammonia. One ammonia tank is located at the rear of the facility, outside the building behind\r\nwaste treatment. Ammonia may also be located in piping and mixing tanks within the powder production areas of the\r\nbuilding. One pump, located at the main ammonia tank, serves all the powder production lines.\r\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor. It is one of the most widely produced chemicals in the United\r\nStates and also occurs naturally in the human body (as a building block for making proteins and other complex\r\nmolecules) and in nature (in soil from bacterial processes and from plant and animal decay). Its distinct odor is\r\nfamiliar to many people, even at low levels, because ammonia is used in smelling salts and household cleaners (e.g.,\r\nwindow-cleaning products). When anhydrous ammonia is dissolved in water, it is called liquid ammonia, ammonium\r\nhydroxide, or aqueous ammonia. Aqueous ammonia is not flammable, but can be toxic, and use of aqueous\r\nammonia is a safer alternative than anhydrous ammonia. Technic uses only aqueous ammonia at the site.\r\nIn 2008, Technic filed a Program Level 1 RMP; however, an August 5, 2011 accidental release of aqueous ammonia\r\ncau"

Up to twenty gallons of aqueous ammonia were released to\r\nTechnic's wastewater treatment system, but did not migrate offsite or impact any environmental or population\r\nreceptors. As a result of the release, Technic revised operating procedures, upgraded equipment labeling, and\r\nsecured additional communication devices to prevent a similar release from occurring.\r\nTechnic personnel do not respond to spills beyond the incidental level. Spills that are not incidental in nature require\r\nthe services of a spill response contractor or other outside responder. To ensure that the facility is adequately\r\nprepared in the event of a release, Technic has an established relationship with local emergency planning personnel.\r\nThe Woonsocket Fire Department serves as the LEPC, and is familiar with the hazards of aqueous ammonia.\r\nTechnic also has the following plans and programs in place at the facility:\r\n\u00bf\u00abThe Emergency Response/Emergency Action Plan addresses coordination with agencies, emergency\r\nrecognition and prevention, lines of authority, communication, security, evacuation, emergency response and\r\ncleanup procedures.\r\n\u00bf\u00abThe Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan addresses response elements related to identification and cleanup of\r\nhazardous waste, including those that may result from a spill event.\r\n\u00bf\u00abThe HAZCOM training program provides employees the necessary background to identify workplace hazards,\r\ninterpret MSDS and labels, obtain personal protection equipment, and have a general awareness of emergency\r\nprocedures for the site.\r\n\u00bf\u00abAn established management system, including an RMP Program Coordinator, oversees the implementation of\r\nthe RMP elements.\r\n\u00bf\u00abOperating, inspection, testing, and maintenance procedures ensure that aqueous ammonia is safely stored and\r\nused.\r\n\u00bf\u00abThe RMP audit program requires that at least one pe"

Technic's worst-case release scenario is based on the most conservative meteorological conditions and an\r\ninstantaneous, catastrophic release of the aqueous ammonia tank into a liquid pool that is contained by the passive\r\nmitigation system. The alternative release scenario is based on expected meteorological conditions and a more\r\nrealistic release scenario that is similar to the August 2011 release. To determine the alternative scenario, Technic\r\nconducted a hazard analysis, reviewed the five year accident history, and considered the ways that aqueous\r\nammonia is used in the process. Technic used RMP*Comp to approximate a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.4 mile at\r\na rate of 583 ft/min for the worst-case release, and <0.1 miles (assumed to equal 0.1 miles) at a rate of 33.4 lbs/min\r\nfor the alternative release. The distance to toxic endpoint is the distance that an accidental release of aqueous\r\nammonia from this facility could travel under the modeled conditions. US Geological Survey (USGS) maps, Rhode\r\nIsland Geographic Information Systems (RIGIS) data, and Landview 6 estimated no environmental receptors for the\r\nworst-case or alternative scenario. Landview 6 estimated a 623 population receptors within the distance to toxic\r\nendpoint for the worst-case scenario and no population receptors for the alternative scenario\r\nAdditional details on Technic's RMP Program are available in the Program Level 2 RMP Plan, which is available\r\nonsite and by specific request. The plan is updated every five years or more often if necessary.
