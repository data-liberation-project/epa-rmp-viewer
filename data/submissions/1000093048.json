This includes carbon steel, rubber and skin tissue. The LNG will vaporize and the resulting flammable gas will rise and dissipate. The key items in an LNG release are to protect personnel and materials from contacting the LNG, shut off the source of the release, contain the liquid until dissipated, and eliminate any ignition sources in the area of the vapor.\n\n\n\nA small leak of LNG spraying on a carbon steel pipe or vessel can cause it to crack. Placing cardboard, plywood, or some other material between the spray and the material can protect it until the leak is stopped A small leak of LNG can be successfully slopped by covering the area with wet rags which will freeze forming a solid ice plug.\n\n\n\nThe storage area has a detention basin designed to hold total volume plus 10% of the main LNG storage tank. The area is slopped to ensure any release of LNG drains into the detention basin. The sump contains a low temperature detection element which activates the, hazard alarm and deactivates the sump pump to ensure containment.\n\n\n\nDO NOT spray water onto the liquid LNG as this will significantly increase the vapor generation rate. If the vapor generation rate needs to be slowed or if the vapors have ignited, use dry chemical fire extinguishing media on the LNG surface.\n\n1.2    LNG - Truck Area Spill\n\nThe hazards are the same except that the location is outside the storage dike area. The key actions remain the same. The most likely cause for a spill is a busted or accidental disconnection of a loading hose at either the truck loading or fueling station. Several safeguards exist including gas detectors, low temperature sump detectors, an automatic fueling shutoff upon disconnecting the fuel nozzle, and a truck loading ESD activated either locally or remotely.\n\n\n\nA spill would be directed"

The sump is large enough to hold an entire trailer contents.\n\n1.3    Sulfuric Acid Spill\n\nA 300 gallon sulfuric acid tank is located inside a contained vessel near the cooling tower. The vessel can contain the contents of the tank. Sulfuric acid is a corrosive material and can cause skin tissue damage. Avoid breathing vapors from the acid. The acid is not capable of supporting combustion. The reportable quantity limit for sulfuric acid released outside the vessel is 1000 pounds. The acid contained inside the vessel must be either returned to storage or neutralized and disposed of properly.\n\n\n\nMaterial outside the dike must be contained in the drainage system to prevent discharge off the property. This can be done with sand bags or an earthen dike. The material must then be neutralized and disposed of properly.\n\n1.4    Amine Spill\n\nThe amine units are also inside dike areas which can contain leaks from equipment. The amine is also considered corrosive requiring personnel protective equipment. The reportable quantity limit for the amine is 1000 pounds. Any spill must be contained, collected and disposed of properly.\n\n1.5    Sodium Hypochlorite Spill\n\nThis material, also known as liquid chlorine, is used in the cooling water system to prevent bacterial organisms from thriving causing problems such as algae in the water. This material is kept in 500 gallon drums inside the dike near the cooling tower. One drum is kept at the potable water well. A spill outside of a dike would cause high residual chlorine levels in the discharge water. To contain and collect this material, use sand bags or an earthen dike. The reportable quantity limit is 100 pounds.\n\n1.6    Oil Spill\n\nOil is used in rotating equipment for lubrication. Any leak must be immediately cleaned up. The use of rags and absorbent material is acceptable as long as the materials are properly disposed of. Any oil in the water drainage m"

The gas could travel along the ground to an ignition source and flash back to the point of release.\n\n\n\nGas detectors are located throughout the plant which alarm at a concentration of 20% LEL and again at 40% LEL. At the latter alarm, a shutdown timer of 2 minutes starts. If the situation is not cleared and the alarm resets in that period or the operator intervenes, an automatic shutdown of the affected area will occur.\n\n1.8    Natural Gas Release\n\nThe natural gas feed to the plant via pipeline is at about 800 psig. The natural gas is primarily methane and is colorless and odorless. A gas detector alarm should be immediately investigated. Due to the high pressure, caution should be used in trying to find a leak to avoid bodily injury. \n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, the feed can be shutdown remotely. If the natural gas ignites, shut off the feed and allow the fire to burn itself out, if it doesn't threaten the health and safety of individuals and/or property damage.\n\n2    Properties Of Liquefied Natural Gas\n\n2.1    Typical chemical composition\n\nComponent    CAS #    Concentration % per volume    DL 50    CL 50\n\nMethane    74-82-8    99.5    N/A    N/A\n\nNitrogen    74-84-0    00.5    N/A    N/A\n\n\n\nExpansion Ratio                                620 to 1 from liquid to vapor\n\n2.2    Physical-chemical characteristics (methane)\n\n\n\nMolecular formula     CH4\n\nPhysical form     Liquefied gas (cryogenic liquid)\n\nAppearance     Limpid liquid\n\nCold vapor                             White cloud\n\nColor and odor     Colorless and odorless \n\nVapor density (air)    0.6\n\nBoiling point     -258.7 ?XF (-161.5 ?X C)\n\nFreezing point     -296.5 ?XF (-182.47?X C)\n\nDensity     0.415 at -263.2 ?XF (-164?X C)\n\nMolecular weight     16.043 g/mol\n\nVapor pressure     4.52 Mpa\n\nEvaporation rate     Not determined\n\nWater/oil partition coeffi"

The incident involved a hot oil pump, which failed, and resulted in a release of DowTherm G Heat Transfer Fluid from a damaged valve.  The fluid sprayed from the damaged valve, coating the surrounding equipment and ground.  The total quantity released was initially estimated at 500 gallons, but was reduced to approximately 350 gallons based on the amount of fluid needed"

The California Office of Emergency Services (OES) was notified second as a requirement for any potentially hazardous material spilled above the Reportable Quantity.  California OES assumed the responsibility of generating a report and making additional notifications to other outside agencies if required.
