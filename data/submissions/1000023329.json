      "SummaryText": "Facilities which manufacture, handle, use and/or store any of the specifically listed toxic and flammable substances in amounts above specified threshold quantities are required to develop and implement a Process Safety Management (PSM) program and/or a Risk Management Program (RMP).  OSHA's PSM Standard \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" (29 CFR 1910.119) is required by the federal Clean Air Act Amendments, as is the USEPA's RMP rule, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (40 CFR Part 68).  The major objectives of these federal mandates include the prevention of catastrophic releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose facility employees and/or the surrounding community and environment, and the mitigation of the severity of any releases that might occur.  An effective PSM/RMP compliance effort requires a systematic approach to evaluating a facility's entire chemical management process.\n\n    The Island Oasis Manufacturing, LLC, facility (IOM)utilizes Anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in its production of the highest quality frozen drinks mixes in the industry in an amount above the applicable threshold quantity under both the PSM and RMP regulations.  This facility has responded to these federal regulations by developing this PSM/RMP Program Document, which summarizes the facility's compliance efforts.  Using a systematic approach, the process technology and design, process changes, operational, maintenance and non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans, training programs, and other elements the affect the regulated process have all been considered by the facility in its evaluation.  By merging the program requirements as mandated by these two sets of regulations, the IOM Facility has attempted to achieve concurrent compliance with both the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to enhance the facility's standing with the surrounding community.\n"
