This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable spills or releases of substances.   If, in spite of all precautions, should a release or spill occur, BASF-Zachary's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. In addition to trained personnel, berms and containment walls are utilized throughout the facility. \n\n  <    Chemical burns caused by corrosives and solvents can occur when personnel come into direct contact with the material.  Prevention of skin and eye contact with any material will prevent these types of injuries.  Training and use of the proper personal protective equipment is emphasized to prevent skin and eye contact.  A safety shower and eye-wash stations are provided in all work areas for the safety of workers in the event skin or eye contact should occur. A current eyewash inspection program is in place to ensure the integrity of each eyewash station.\n\n  <    Burns resulting from fires or explosion would be similar to any high temperature burns.  Smoke inhalation is also a possibility in a fire. Fire monitors and sprinkler systems are located throughout the plant. A significant number of employees are members of the plant's Fire Brigade and are trained to fight incipient fires\n\n  <    Storage and handling of flammable liquids pose the greatest potential for causing an emergency.

Smoking is prohibited in the hazardous material storage areas and access is restricted to authorized personnel.   Other combustible materials are stored at a safe distance from flammable liquids.   Drums are kept securely closed unless it becomes necessary to sample or transfer the chemical.   Potential sources of ignition are avoided when chemicals are being handled.   Flammable liquids are only handled where ventilation is adequate to avoid amassing a concentration of explosive vapors. Hot Work procedures are in place and permits must be issued before Hot Work must be conducted.\n\nThe BASF - Zachary site is also manned by a 24/7 Guard Service to prevent any incidents involving unauthorized persons who may accidently or intentionally cause damage to our site, our neighbors, or the environment. BASF - Zachary also abides by all DHS Security regulations and has a DOT Security Plan in place.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nBASF-Zachary manufactures, processes, and stores specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and evaluated the facility to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, BASF-Zachary identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  See the Registration Information in Section I of this RMP Plan for details on chemicals and processes.  \n\nIn addition, BASF-Zachary is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869).  Therefore, the four BASF-Zachary processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure "

BASF-Zachary has 2 worst case scenarios for flammables because the scenarios go off-site and affect different off-site receptors.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi over pressure for the worst-case release of 2-methylpropene using RMP Comp is 0.3 miles and for the flammable mixture (with acetaldehyde) using RMP Comp is also 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances:      Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the three regulated toxic substances at BASF-Zachary was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  The RMP Comp results indicate that a worst-case release of methyl chloride results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 3.7 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  BASF-Zachary considered several alternative release scenarios.  Using RMP Comp, it was determined that a hypothetical release of 2-Methyl Propene would result in the greatest off-site impact, having a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  In addition, BASF-Zachary has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nThe BASF-Zachary site has also implemented a Behavior Based Safety Program. This program enables employees to observe work being performed and determine if any unsafe behaviors occur. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:    BASF-Zachary keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs)/safety data sheets (SDSs).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nBASF-Zachary primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident/hazard scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, BASF periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:     BASF-Zachary maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  \n\n\n\nTraining:     To complement the written procedures for process operations, BASF-Zachary ha"

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.   In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\n\n\nContractors:    BASF-Zachary uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work.  In addition, BASF-Zachary evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):    BASF-Zachary conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance employees receive training as applicable to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.   Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).   Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. BASF-Zachary incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits and Other Safe Work Practices:    BASF-Zachary has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  A hot work permit system is used to control potential ignition sources.    Other procedures include: confined space entry; lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources; work permits to assure safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened; and personal protective equipment to provide employee protection.    Training of personnel in safety procedures helps ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:     BASF-Zachary has a comprehe"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) identify hazards, (2) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (3) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:     BASF-Zachary promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:     To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, BASF-Zachary periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. \n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at BASF-Zachary have hazards specific to the individual chemicals that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  These are addressed through operating procedures for the DXA/DXL (Dioxane/Dioxolane), Glymes, and the Multi-Purpose Units.   In addition to other measures, flammable materials (2-Methylpropene and others) are stored and used under nitrogen blanket to prevent mixing with air which could form flammable mixtures.    Toxic substances are often stored under pressure (methyl chloride) and/or under nitrogen blanket at lower pressures to prevent atmospheric venting or introduction of air or moisture. \n\nBASF-Zachary h"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, incident mitigation and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The plant routinely performs maintenance on emergency equipment including tests and inspections and provides employee training on equipment use.  Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or for changes in personnel.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for BASF-Zachary is coordinated with East Baton Rouge Parish emergency response officials and the Zachary Fire Department.   Periodic meetings with response agency personnel are conducted to discuss needs and concerns in the event of an incident at the plant.  BASF-Zachary has around-the-clock communications capability with state and federal agencies and with local emergency response agencies through a hotline system to access additional emergency equipment and services (i.e., firefighting equipment, manpower, ambulances, hospitals, law enforcement, and HAZMAT "

BASF-Zachary conducts periodic emergency drills that involve local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBASF-Zachary has several elements of the management system of the accident prevention program in place to improve safety throughout the facility.  These elements are part of an overall ongoing safety improvement process.\n\nBASF-Zachary recently implemented the BASF \"Journey to Excellence\" program designed to be worked through concerted efforts of all BASF employees. The program is a goal oriented system for continuous improvement of safety performance which not only results in safer workplaces and safer communities where we operate, but it also provides all of our employees an opportunity to participate in noteworthy safety functions which will improve the overall safety culture of our site. Site focus for this program includes: a program launch with 100% employee participation; development of a safety roadmap; reactivating safety committees; upgrading safety systems throughout the site; enhancement of training such as operations, procedures, permit reviews, PSM/RMP analysis/compliance audits, PHA and MOC leadership, and Root Cause Analysis and practices; and conducting EHS assessments.\n\nIn addition, the BASF-Zachary site is strongly involved in a Behavior Based Observation Program that heightens the site's ability to recognize hazards and to prevent incidents from happening. Employees do an excellent job of \"looking out\" for one another.\n\n"
