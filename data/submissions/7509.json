We operate under our parent company, Hercules Incorporated, policy for Safety, Health & Environment.  This policy states: \n\n\"...we are dedicated to and working towards continuous improvement in our operations to prevent pollution; to reduce risk; and to enhance safety, health and environmental performance.\"\n\n \"We will evaluate the safety, health, and environmental impacts of new and existing products and operations and will work to reduce adverse impacts.\"\n\n \"We will work to continually reduce workplace injuries; incidents with the potential for causing property damage, material loss, or interruption of our business; waste; and releases to the environment.\"\n\n\nFacility Description And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nBetzDearborn Inc. manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals, primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers and cooling towers.  Most of our products are formulated by blending several raw materials within a mixing vessel and then packaging into various size containers.  Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5 gallon pails to 6000 gallon truckload quantities.  Similarly, our raw materials which we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\n\nThe BetzDearborn - New Philadelphia Plant covers 14.7 acres of property, of which 3.1 acres is used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot or open lawn, or idle areas.  At the facility, cyclohexylamine is a chemical raw material stored onsite as a liquid in a bulk storage tank.  It acts as a corrosio"

This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) And The Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nWithin the cyclohexylamine bulk tank storage process, our \"Worst Case\" event involves a scenario where the entire contents of a storage tank are lost as an instantaneous release to a containment area outdoors.  Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, this scenario would have an offsite consequence.  This material is stored in a protected containment area and for the purposes of meeting the EPA requirements we did consider passive controls.  We also conservatively viewed that an entire tank would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release, even though our facility personnel are capable of responding to mitigate a release of this chemical in various ways.  \n\nAs an \"Alternative Scenario\" an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" involving cyclohexylamine, we considered a release event of an entire tank over a period of time, again using the EPA methodology.  Passive mitigation systems were included in this scenario as well.  The analysis indicates that this scenario would have an offsite consequence but it would be limited to a distance approximately one-half of the \"Worst Case\" scenario.  We chose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline, although we feel an event involving a small leak of substantially less than an entire tank quantity would be more likely and would have no offsite consequences.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and pr"

The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of operating procedures, processes for insuring proper training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals, preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases, processes for managing changes in the process and conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur.  The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAt the BetzDearborn - New Philadelphia Plant, we had one accidental release that resulted in an employee injury within the past 5 years due to the mishandling of cyclohexylamine.  We investigated this incident according to the Corporate Incident Investigation program and discovered that the accident occurred as a result of failure to follow established procedures.  The release duration was approximately 5 seconds and amounted to less than 1 pound.   As a result of this incident, we conducted retraining on proper operating procedures and posted signage to remind operators.  Prior to this incident, which occurred in 1998, we have never had an accidental release of this material in 25 years of operation.  We believe that we have instituted appropriate controls on the continued handling of cyclohexylamine to prevent reoccurrence of a similar incident.\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements:\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities\n- Quarterly inspections to determine any new sources of ignit"

Also, we intend to evaluate the feasibility of additional fire protection equipment to service RMP regulated processes."
