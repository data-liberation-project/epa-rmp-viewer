In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemical including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Cargill.   Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process rather than a chemical process.  Ammonia, the refrigerant is used as a heat transfer media to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists of four processes: evaporation, condensation, compression, and expansion.  Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.  Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy.  The ammonia refrigeration "

To evaporate liquid ammonia to a vapor, latent heat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid.\n\nThis location has prepared worst case and alternative case release scenarios using the ALOHA air dispersion modeling software which calculates the distance to the toxic endpoints. \n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility?s ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nCargill's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Harrisonburg Joint  Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)"

All of the recommendations from the PHA will be resolved by January 2005."
