Compliance with EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68), Federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) is also be maintained. This plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system at Columbus Foods - 3190 Corporate Place, Hayward, California.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the facility requirements and defines design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  Columbus Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with the CalARP rules as a result of meeting other regulatory program requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the CalARP requirements, that information is contained in this document.\r\n\r\n1.1.\tCommitment to Safety\r\n\r\nColumbus Foods is committed to providing all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  We are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.\tIt is the policy of Columbus Foods to: \r\n\r\n1.1.1.1\tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.2\tComply with all federal, state, and local occupational hea"

Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, engineering/administrative controls to handle these substances will be implemented.\r\n\r\n1.1.4.\tColumbus Foods has prepared a safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility in addition to establishing a Process Safety Management Program.  It is the responsibility of the facility's management to carry out these programs.\r\n\r\n1.1.5.\tThe first duty of Columbus Foods employees is to exercise care in the performance of their work tasks to prevent an accident to themselves, co-workers, the general public or equipment.

The facility is a salame processing, slicing, and packaging facility that receives raw materials from suppliers. The raw product is processed on site to make final and work in process products.  Final products are pushed into the company supply chain for distribution to customers and consumers.  Work in process products are transferred to other company or co-pack facilities for slicing and/or final packaging.\r\n\r\n1.3.2.\tAnhydrous ammonia, which is regulated under CalARP, is utilized at Columbus Foods in the facility's ammonia refrigeration systems. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized for refrigeration in a single ammonia process.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators, chillers, condensers, compressors and miscellaneous refrigeration equipment located throughout the refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system operates at three temperature levels designed to cool air and glycol for various rooms.  Low, medium, and high temperature recirculated liquid ammonia is pumped throughout the process via refrigerant pumps.  The ammonia liquid flows through the coils of the air units where it absorbs heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  Glycol is pumped through AHU's, and RMAU's where it absorbs heat from the process rooms and transfers the heat to the ammonia system at the flooded chillers.  The ammonia vapor is sent from the evaporators and chillers to the corresponding recirculator vessels or surge drum and is then routed to the compressors. During the compression phase, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased.  The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the compressor to the evaporative condenser where heat is rejected, turning the ammonia vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The hi"

Also in place is a Process Safety Management program as required by Cal OSHA Title 8, Section 5189 and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. A Management System has been developed to oversee the regulatory programs at the Columbus Foods facility.   \r\n\r\n1.4.\tWorst/Alternate Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\n1.4.1.\tAlthough engineering controls incorporated into the refrigeration process would normally prevent such releases, the possibility of a \"catastrophic release\" does exist.  Based on that premise, the facility has modeled two off site consequence analyses; one worst case scenario and one alternate case scenario. \r\n\r\n1.4.2.\tFor all scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 2.0) modeling software was used to determine Off-Site Consequence Analyses.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release and potential receptors are discussed in the facilities overall Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\n1.5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\n1.5.1.\tColumbus Foods is equipped with emergency warning systems.  Alarms (both visual and auditory) are strategically placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees will follow in the event of release, which can be found in the facility Emergency Response Plan on file and located with other critical regulatory program documentation. These procedures include appropriate notification and evacuation of facility personnel.\r\n\r\n1.5.2.\tIn the event that an ammonia release or spill does occur, off-site responders, specifically the Haywa"
