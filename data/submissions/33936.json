The plant was operated by Alpac Foods, Inc. until July, 1991 when United Foods, Inc., now The Pictsweet Company, Bells, TN, took over the operations.  In 1989, Bonneville Pacific Corporation constructed a cogeneration plant on property adjacent to the plant site and at that time became the primary source for steam and ammonia refrigeration; however, the cogeneration plant no longer supplies refrigeration for the plant.  The plant processes, freezes and distributes frozen vegetables.  Steam is used to blanch the product and as a heat source for other plant functions.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool incoming product, freeze the product after preparation and to maintain cold storage warehouse temperatures while the finished goods await distribution by truck or rail.  Chlorine is used to sanitize the water coming into contact with the product and as a protection against bacterial contamination after processing.\n\nThe plant has its own mechanical refrigeration system that is now used exclusively to provide the refrigeration needs of the plant.  The cooling and freezing operations use cold liquid ammonia to absorb heat from the product or insulated spaces.  The liquid evaporates to a gas and is returned to the plant Engine Room for heat removal and conversion back to a liquid form and the cycle begins again.  System pressures vary from a 11\" Hg vacuum on the suction side of the cycle to approximately 160 P.S.I. on the high-pressure side of the cycle.  Ammonia for use in the refrigeration process is stored in the Engine Room vessels and in evaporator coils located throughout the plant .\n\nThe plant has developed an emergency response program to handle any onsite and offsite consequences.  Currently, there are 20 individuals that are certified as a First Respond"

The plant direct telephone number is (805) 928-4414 and the 24-hour emergency group beeper telephone number is (805) 349-5802.  This beeper will activate the site emergency response team.  There is also a 24-hour onsite security service.  Wherever possible, all notification procedures, including initial telephone reports and the follow-up written reports, are performed by Bells, TN Corporate Personnel.  The plant outside local emergency notification is accomplished through the 911 system.  Contact is also made to the EPA if the ammonia spill is greater than 100 pounds.\n\n\nPlant Accident History\n\nThere has been one incident during the past five (5) years that qualifies for reporting under 40CFR Part 68.  At approximately 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, October 16, 1999 approximately 25 gallons (125 pounds) of liquid ammonia was released from a newly installed ammonia valve.  The leak was quickly isolated and the valve sealed.  There was no personnel injury or property damage as a result of this incident; however, a security guard was treated for hyperventilation and released.  As a result of the incident investigation for this accident, the company modified operating procedures involving contractor coordination with plant personnel.\n\n\nPlant Evaluation and Seismic Study\n\nA Process Hazards Analysis of the system was initially performed in 1991.  The Analysis was updated in 1995 in conjunction with development of an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for the plant.  The Analysis was reviewed and updated as appropriate in August, 1999.   Compliance Audits performed in March, 2000 and May, 2004 have confirmed that the PHA remains valid.\n\nIn 1992, a Seismic Assessment was performed on the storage and piping systems by Agbabian and Associates, Engineers and Consultants.

All elements of the program are currently functioning at this facility.  Training of appropriate personnel is an ongoing activity with both new hires and continuing employees.  All chemical valves, piping and equipment are inspected regularly and inspection records are reviewed by supervisory personnel.  All emergency equipment is inspected quarterly and evacuation and emergency drills are held annually.  Contact with the Santa Maria Fire Department is an ongoing activity.  Training of all persons who may operate or repair the chemical systems receive training in the following areas:\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\nManagement of Change\nMechanical Integrity\nIncident Investigation\nOther basic safety practices in use on a daily basis including LockOut-TagOut, Hot Work Permits and Confined Space Permits"
