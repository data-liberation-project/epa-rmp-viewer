A security company, ADT, monitors the propane system to provide 24 hour day surveillance.\n\nThe propane threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The plant administratively limits the amount of propane stored in the one storage tank to 80%.   The maximum amount of propane contained onsite is 100,800 pounds of propane.

The worst-case release for the ammonia system would result from a puncture in the liquid portion of the high pressure receiver.  The high pressure receiver is located outside at the center of the western portion of the plant.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 8,704 pounds.

      "SummaryText": "AMMONIA PROCESS\n\nThe Florence facility has one ammonia refrigeration process used for process and space cooling.  The ammonia system is a single stage system utilizing four thermosyphon cooled rotary screw ammonia compressors.  Cooling loads are fed ammonia from either the high pressure receiver or controlled pressure receiver.  Two suction accumulators are used to control temperature for the various evaporators in the facility.  Evaporative loads include seven coils in the cookie cooling tunnel, one scraped surface heat exchanger, one ice builder, one shell and tube water chiller and one air handling unit in the dry ingredients room.  The four compressors discharge to three evaporative condensers via a common discharge header.  Condensed ammonia flows by gravity from the evaporative condensers to the thermosyphon receiver.  Standpipes in the thermosyphon receiver provide liquid ammonia to the high pressure receiver and controlled pressure receiver.  \n\nThe majority of the pressurized vessels for the ammonia system are located within the plant structure in the ammonia room.  Access to the ammonia room is limited to employees who have been certified in the plant's ammonia operator training program or are authorized contractors.  Visitors are not allowed in the ammonia room unless accompanied by a certified Keebler employee.\n\nThe ammonia system is continually monitored to ensure the system is operating within specified control limits.\n\nThe ammonia system's inventory is approximately 17,000 pounds.  Thus, the plant exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68.    \n\n2.2\tPROPANE PROCESS\n\nThe facility has one propane process.  The main components of the propane stand-by fuel process are: a 30,000 gallon water capacity storage tank, one pump, a water-bath vaporizer, two regulators, and piping.  The piping located outside of the plant is buried to prevent contact with heavy machinery and condensation in the propane lines. \n\nThe propane storage tank"

The prevention program was written to be in compliance with 40 CFR 68, to ensure the safety of the employees, and to ensure the safety of the surrounding community. Keebler developed a training program for the propane system personnel.  The program discusses: (1) the potential hazards associated with propane, (2) the proper operating and maintenance procedures for the propane system, and (3) certification of employees for operation of the propane system.  The plant also uses vendors who are NFPA-58 compliant.\n\n 5\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n5.1 AMMONIA PROCESS\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history for ammonia includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 1999.  The plant has had one ammonia release during the five-year accident history period.  The accident occurred on August 28, 1997.  Approximately 800 pounds of ammonia was released.

The pull-away consists of a failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch diameter hose.  The excess flow valve stops the flow from the tank resulting in the release of the hose contents.  The hose contents, 69 pounds of propane, results in a vapor cloud explosion. Since the facility is located in a populated area the vapor cloud explosion would affect public receptors.\n 4\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n4.1\tAMMONIA PROCESS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and all Federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The plant conducts inspections of the ammonia process to ensure the integrity of the system.  The inspections provide the ammonia process engineers with valuable information that helps to prevent the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario from occurring. \n\nThe Florence plant has developed an OHSA PSM program for ammonia.

The alternative release scenario consists of the sight glass being sheared off of the high pressure receiver.  The release occurs near ground level as a horizontal jet.  There are no applicable administrative controls or passive mitigation.  The system is shut down approximately 60 minutes from the start of the release.

Various types of release scenarios are possible including vapor cloud fires (flash fires), a pool fire with radiant heat effects, boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) leading to a fireball producing intense heat, a vapor cloud explosion, and a jet fire from a hole in a tank.

A ten percent yield factor is assumed from the TNT-equivalency formula.  Thus, ten percent of the released quantity will participate in a resulting explosion.  Company policy limits filling the 30,000 gallon propane tank to 80% of the capacity at 60oF.  The total released quantity of propane is 100,800 pounds.  Since the facility"
