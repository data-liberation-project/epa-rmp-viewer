      "SummaryText": "1. Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\nThe management and employees of AgVantage FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Aplington Fire Department, Butler County Local Emergency Planning Committee  or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 17995 Highway 57, Aplington, IA. Is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  There are two separate systems at this location.  One system consists of 1 - 12,000 gallon storage tank, a railroad car in the spring season, loading risers, associated plumbing.  The second system consists of 1 - 26,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 471,000 pounds.  This includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank (rail road car) as limited by design standards. \n \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.

The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n5. Five year accident history.   \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Aplington Fire Department and the Bremer Co. LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.  \n\nSafety im"
