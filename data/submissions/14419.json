At a minimum, OWTP employees will: (1) participate in the development and implementation of the site specific Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP programs; (2) participate in conducting the chlorine and ammonia process hazard analysis; (3) be trained annually on the PSM and RMP programs and made aware of any interim changes to the program or process systems; (4) work with management to develop additional programs or procedures relative to chlorine and ammonia process safety; and, (5) participate in periodic audits of the chemical processes and the PSM Program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPreventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised, as necessary, to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe OWTP has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsibility for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Planning Committees.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe OWTP utilizes chlorine and ammonia for disinfection of treated water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChem"

OWTP is therefore not subject to the RMP requirements for ammonia other than those in the General Duty Clause.  These requirements are 1) to inform and coordinate with local emergency responders about the presence of the substance on site and to provide a safe environment through adequate process safety.  The OWTP meets those requirements for ammonia.  An alternative case scenario model was run in case future on site maximum inventory exceeds the regulatory threshold ceiling.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) evaluated a worst-case release and an alternative release scenario.  A dense gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  The model input parameters and assumptions fulfilled 40 CFR Part 68 requirements and are summarized in the following table\n\nSLAB Input Parameters Worst-Case Scenario       Alternative Scenario\n                                                                                Chlorine / Ammonia\nEnd Point Concentration (mg/l)  0.0087                     0.0087 / 0.14\nWindspeed (m/s)                          1.5                                 3.0\nAtmospheric Stability Class           F                                     D\nTemperature (0 F)                          77                                  77\nHumidity (%)                                  50                                  50\nHeight of Release (m)                  0.00                                0.01\nSurface Roughness (m)              0.02                                0.09\nImpact Radius (miles)                   6.2                       "

The population data was estimated using the Land-view block uniform density group method.\n\nThe OWTP is located in a predominantly urbanized area and no environmental receptors such as national and state parks, forests, monuments, wildlife preserves or wilderness areas were identified within the radius of impact for either scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe OWTP has acquired knowledge regarding process safety and hazard assessment.  Under Program 3, OWTP has used this information to implement policies and procedures related to operations, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigations, compliance audits, management of change, pre-start review, contractors, employee participation, and hot work permits in order to create a safe workplace.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe completion of the Hazard Assessment resulted in the recognition of preventive steps to eliminate or minimize the possibility for accidental releases and employee exposure to chemical risk.\n\nProcess Safety Management Program\n\nOWTP has compiled a Process Safety Management program to minimize releases.  This Program includes safety information related to the covered chemicals, hazard review, operating and maintenance schedules, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the chemical processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage."
