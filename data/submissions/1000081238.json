The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is resubmitting the EPA RMP as a 5-year update.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 and 3 PSM/RMPr Facility have been addressed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at this Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Railcar Storage (Aqua Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 3: Anhydrous Ammonia transfer to Tanker Truck\n\no    Covered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Transfer to Storage Tanks\n\no    Covered Process 5: Aqua Ammonia Blending\n\no    Covered Process 6: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 7: Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Blending\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 3,302,072 lbs (assuming that twenty (20) 34,000-gallon railcars are filled to their administrative capacity), and the total ammonia (concentration 20% or greater) in the aqua ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 769,774 lbs (assuming that the nine (9) 22,000-gallon railcars and five (5) ASTs are filled to t"

The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 3, 5, and 7), the worst case release was modeled as if a 34,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia, two releases were modeled.  One worst case release scenario (i.e. representing Covered Processes 2 and 4) assumes that a 22,000-gallon aqua ammonia railcar failed and instantaneously spills the content into an area with no secondary containment resulting in a release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.  The other worst case release scenario (i.e. representing Covered Process 6) assumes that the 46,000-gallon aqua ammonia AST fails within the secondary containment resulting in a contained release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1), and (2) rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Processes 3, 5, and 7.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Processes 2 and 4, and a release of aqua ammonia due to a rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a major loading operation associated with Covered Process 6.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at"

      "SummaryText": " this Facility. The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
