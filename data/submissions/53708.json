      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nWestern Zirconium, a division of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, is an integrated manufacturing facility, which extracts zirconium and produces zirconium metal and metal products. The facility, which employs about 400 people is located in a remote area of Weber County, Utah, near the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake. The zirconium produced by Western Zirconium is used worldwide primarily by the commercial nuclear fuels industry. The process of producing zirconium metal involves the use of several chemicals including chlorine and ammonia. Because of the nature of the manufacturing process, the facility typically maintains a sizable inventory of these chemicals on-site. We also maintain a large quantity of propane, which is used for supplemental heating and to fuel a calciner and the plant boilers. The employees of Western Zirconium are proud of our 30-year history of safe handling of these chemicals. While the products we produce are used by nuclear power utilities, the products we make do not contain radioactive materials.\n\nThe following paragraphs present some additional information about Western Zirconium, its commitment to\nsafety and protection of the environment, and how we employ this commitment to minimize risk to the community.\n\nOur Commitment to Safety and the Environment\n\nThe employees and management at Western Zirconium believe that nothing is more important than the health and safety of its employees, its contractors, the general public, and the protection of the environment. Western Zirconium prides itself on its commitment to meet or exceed all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Since 1992 Western Zirconium has held \"Star\" status under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nOSHA VPP recognizes worksites that have achieved and are maintaining excellence in worker safety and\nhealth protection through cooperation among labor, management, and government. The VPP is comp"

      "SummaryText": "osed of\nthree programs. The Star Program is the highest level of the VPP and designates sites that have distinguished themselves with the highest level of safety and health excellence. By granting Western Zirconium Star status OSHA has recognized our management commitment and meaningful employee involvement in safety and health programs. These programs include worksite analysis for hazards, hazard prevention and control, and employee safety and health training.\n\nOur commitment to safety and environmental protection includes the following specific commitments:\n? A commitment to prevent accidents and to minimize, as far as reasonably achievable, the consequences of any accident which may occur;\n? A commitment to meet all statutory requirements for safety and environmental protection;\n? A commitment to strive for continual improvement in performance;\n? A commitment to strive to increase safety and environmental awareness among employees and the public;\n? A commitment to consider safety and environmental effects in designing and operating plant processes;\n? A commitment to minimize waste and encourage the reuse and recycling of materials;\n? A commitment to the efficient use of energy, water and raw materials;\n? A commitment to monitor discharges, disposals and the environment around the company site to ensure\ncompliance with appropriate standards;\n? A commitment to encourage dialogue with employees, members of the public, local authorities, regulators and other interested parties;\n\nHow We Minimize Risks to the Community\n\nThe manufacture of zirconium and the fabrication of zirconium products entails the use of chlorine, ammonium hydroxide (aqueous ammonia) and anhydrous ammonia. The facility stores these chemicals in tanks and rail cars and transfers them into process equipment through pipelines. Because these chemicals are inherently toxic or flammable, the management and employees of Western Zirconium have spent a considerable amount of time and effort assessing potent"

      "SummaryText": "ial dangers associated with storing and using these chemicals in our processes. In doing so, we employed EPA and OSHA recognized approaches for evaluating potential hazards. Potential dangers associated with these chemicals include potential toxic release, fire, and environmental impact.\n\nThe risk associated with a chemical hazard is evaluated based on several variables, including the likelihood of a release occurring, the inherent hazards of the chemical involved, the quantity released, the potential impact of the release on the public and the environment, and mitigating influences such as safety planning and safety systems. Pursuant to the requirements of EPA?s Risk Management Program, we have analyzed worst case scenarios using assumptions developed by EPA and site specific alternative scenarios. For specific reasons discussed below, we believe the alternative site specific scenario is more representative of a realistic worst case. For both scenarios, we have followed procedures outlined in EPA?s Risk Management Plan Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance document. Data developed using EPA?s guidance document is very conservative, that is, it overestimates the distance a toxic release would likely travel.\n\nLow public risk exists for the following reasons:\n\n? Western Zirconium uses generally recognized best management practices and methods to prevent\naccidental releases of hazardous chemicals. These methods include such things as employee training,\npreventative and predictive maintenance procedures to prevent equipment failures, automatic shutoffs, and\nmonitoring systems. Well established operating procedures are used to ensure that process equipment is\noperated within safe limits.\n\n? Western Zirconium's safety program includes an Emergency Response Plan and on-site response teams.\nOur ability to respond to an emergency has always been a top priority for Western Zirconium. The plant has its own well trained and equipped Fire and Hazardous Materials Response Teams "

      "SummaryText": "staffed by employees. These response teams receive special training comparable to local fire departments. Our response teams periodically conduct training exercises with local fire departments. Western Zirconium emergency response is coordinated by the Weber County, Utah, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Because of our expertise in handling chemical emergencies, the public emergency response agencies have asked Western Zirconium?s Fire and Hazardous Material Response Teams for assistance, on occasion, to protect the community from chemical emergencies caused by others. The local communities know they can call on us at any time to assist them as needed.\n\n? In the event a release would occur, it is generally the area most near the site of the release -- within a half mile or less ? that would be most affected. The Western Zirconium facility is located in a remote unoccupied area with no adjacent residential population. Western Zirconium owns the vacant land surrounding our facility, which reduces the risk of a chemical release leaving our site.\n\nFor More Information\nIf you would like to learn more about Western Zirconium or Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, please visit our Internet web page at www.westinghousenuclear.com or contact Mr. Kent J.
