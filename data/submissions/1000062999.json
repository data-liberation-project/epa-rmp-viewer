Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed as part of a comprehensive contractor qualification process. \r\n\r\nThe Carrollton site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's scope of work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans have been developed.  These are coordinated with local emergency response resources and verified with the Carroll County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nThe Carrollton site maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including management of the process involved in the release, adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \r\n\r\nTo ensure preparedness, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. \r\nEmergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.

Several initiatives that have the goal of improving process safety have been implemented or expanded at the site since the 2012 RMP submittal including increased use of risk assessment, more extensive process hazard analysis, emphasis on operator training, use of balance of consequence program, and additional strengthening of the mechanical integrity program.  \r\n\r\nIntegration into the Dow Chemical Company will help to further reinforce the emphasis on strong process safety programs and management systems.  The following initiatives will be implemented to strengthen and improve process safety performance: \r\n\r\nImplementation of Dow's Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) tool.  This tool identifies events and scenarios that can lead to undesired consequences.  An inventory of available independent layers of protection is then taken.  If the available layers of protection are deemed sufficient to avoid the consequence from occurring, then no action is necessary.  However if a gap exists then actions are taken to add appropriate layers of protection.\r\n\r\nIncreased emphasis on reactive chemistry reviews to ensure that the hazards related to reactive chemistry are fully understood and properly mitigated. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of a list of most-effective-technology solutions for a variety of issues.  These solutions will represent the best available solutions (analogous to RAGAGEP) that are the results of leveraged learnings from other siloxane producing facilities (where applicable) as well as Dow and other external manufacturing facilities.  Implementation of the solutions will occur on a prioritized basis."

At the time of the 2017 RMP submittal, all Dow Corning facilities were in the midst of a migration towards operation under and adherence to policies and standards of the Dow Chemical Company. The Dow Corning facilities at the Carrollton, Kentucky site are referred to as the Carrollton site.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Carrollton site is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, maintenance and emergency response.  The program relies on the disciplined use of policies, procedures, employee training, preventive maintenance/inspection, safety reviews, management of change, investigations, and audits to reduce the frequency and consequence of accidental chemical releases. \r\n\r\nThe Dow Corning Corporation is a member of the American Chemistry Council as is the Dow Chemical Company.

A majority (by mass) of these monomers are intermediates that are consumed on-site (via reaction with water) to produce siloxane materials that are the building-blocks for finished silicone products.  Other monomers are shipped via rail tank car or tank truck to other Dow Corning facilities or directly to external customers for use in a variety of products.  RMP-listed substances are required as raw materials to produce these chlorosilane monomers.  I-pentane and n-pentane are generated by side-reactions that occur during the production of chlorosilane monomers.    \r\n\r\nMultiple RMP-listed substances in the 2012 submittal have been eliminated from the 2017 submittal due to process reconfiguration that effectively reduced the respective quantities well below threshold values.  \r\n\r\nThe 2017 RMP submittal includes five (5) process units compared to 20 process units for the 2012 submittal.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is annual certified and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Carrollton site maintains a mechanical integrity program that includes a documented preventative maintenance (PM) and inspection program for a variety of process components including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown and control systems, pumps and compressors.  Mechanical integrity inspections may also occur as a result of any questionable findings found during routine work.
