Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Prarieland FS, Inc are committed to the \n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release \n\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Kinderhook Fire Department, \n\nPike County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any \n\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, is the storage \n\nof fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, \n\nand distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and \n\nhandling system consists of storage tanks, loading risers, \n\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized \n\nfacility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \n\nstate codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety \n\nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by \n\nThe American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the \n\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \n\n1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these \n\nregulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention \n\nprogram. \n\n\n\n4. Five year accident history.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- \n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in \n\nplace, property dam"
