We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n? A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n? An overview of our emergency response program\n? An overview of recent improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide to produce a wide variety of soaps, detergents and agricultural products for use in consumer and industrial products.  The EPA has identified these chemicals as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario (as defined by the EPA) and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitiga"

A railcar holds 180,000 pounds of liquid ethylene oxide. The evaporating ethylene oxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  The site has implemented a process safety management system, including railcar inspection, security, physical barriers and unloading procedures intended to prevent this type of incident from occurring.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Ethylene Oxide\n\nOne RMP alternative release scenario involves the rupture of an ethylene oxide piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 15,930 pounds of ethylene oxide over a period of 45 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use automatic and manually operated valves to stop such a release.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, ethylene oxide released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.6 miles of the facility.  The public receptors that could be impacted by such a release are nearby residences. The site has implemented a process safety management program that includes inspection and scheduled replacement of piping connectors to prevent this type of scenario from occurring.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene Oxide\n\nOur last alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a propylene oxide piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 15,400 pounds of propylene oxide over a period of 45 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use automatic and manually operated valves to stop such a release.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, propylene oxide released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.18 miles of the facility.  The public receptors that could be impacted by such a release are "

Holly Plant we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n? Process safety information\n? Process hazard analysis\n? Operating procedures\n? Training and certification of operators\n? Mechanical integrity\n? Management of change\n? Pre-startup review\n? Compliance audits\n? Incident investigation\n? Employee participation\n? Hot work permit\n? Contractor safety\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? Dual, independent safety controls on the ethylene oxide systems\n? Operators are specifically trained and certified on the chemical systems they operate. Training is conducted each year in safety and chemical processing, and operators must recertify on the systems they operate every three years.\n? Contractors are selected for their safety record and maintenance capabilities\n? All processes undergo extensive safety analysis by teams of engineers, chemists, plant operator, and maintenance personnel before beginning operation. Systems are reanalyzed at least every five years.\n? All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operators, maintenance, engineering, and chemists in a safety review\n? Hazardous materials handling procedures\n? Ethylene oxide and propylene oxide equipment and storage tank inspection, certification and maintenance program\n\nThese individual elements of our prevent"

Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no RMP-level releases of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide in the past five years at our facility. However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our site.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nWe also gather information on other significant incidents at other facilities, and implement changes if necessary in our facility to prevent incidents.\n\nEmergency Response Planning:\n\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of RMP chemicals.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Gaston and Mecklenburg County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Emergency response drills have also been conducted with the local emergency response organizations. \n\nTwenty Seven Clariant Mt. Holly employees are trained in emergency response, fire fighting, and hazardous materials response and must pass a physical exam and proficiency tests. Training for a typical emergency responder is over 70 hours per year.
