The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the San Leandro Milk Plant\r\n\r\nThe San Leandro Milk Plant produces fluid milk and other products that require refrigeration.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the San Leandro Milk Plant.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation.\r\n\r\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process: the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle.  Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor.

Personnel will attempt to shut off equipment if possible, and proceed to the meeting place upwind of the facility by observing the windsock on top of the Raw Milk Tank (RT-5). The primary meeting place is at the Truck Repair Shop, in the southwest corner of the property. The secondary meeting place is the front parking lot between the office and Raw Milk Receiving Bays.
