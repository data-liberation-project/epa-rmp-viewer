As part of this commitment, Ingredion has established a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental management process to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Ingredion sites operate under a corporate-led Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System. The program details expected practices in areas of Community Awareness and Emergency Response, Pollution Prevention, Process Safety, Employee Health and Safety, Distribution, and Product Stewardship. These management practices govern our daily operations to provide a safe work site for our employees, improve the environment, and contribute to the welfare of our community. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ingredion Cedar Rapids plant utilizes a corn wet milling process to manufacture food grade starches and industrial starches. Ingredion also manufactures fuel grade ethanol.  In the starch manufacturing process, Ingredion uses two regulated toxic substances which are stored on site above the EPA threshold quantity.  These substances are ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.  In the fuel grade ethanol manufacturing process, Ingredion uses denaturant (natural gasoline).  Denaturant may contain regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\nEthylene oxide is used in the Hydroxyethyl Starch Process. These modified starches are used for industrial starch ingredients. Propylene oxide is used in the hydroxypropylated starch process. These modified starches are used for food ingredients.  These EO and PO modified starches are collectively referred to as Modified Starch Process.  The main components of the modified starch process are rail unloading, storage and process tanks, pumps, compressor (EO only), a"

In the information provided by a previous supplier, the denaturant had a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of less than 4, thus was exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). Due to current supplier information and due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, Ingredion may receive material that has a flammability rating of 4. Denaturant has been managed as a PSM chemical since the process was installed.  Regulated substances found in natural gasoline may include, but are not limited to:  n pentane, isopentane, and n-butane. The main components of the denaturant system are truck unloading, storage tanks, truck and rail loading, pumps, and associated piping.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps  \n\nThe processes at Ingredion have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The processes at Ingredion that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Ingredion's PSM program utilized for the prevention of accidental chemical releases at the Cedar Rapids plant include the following elements:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Management, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Emergency Planning and Response, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  Collectively, these prevention programs help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Ingredion has installed safety features on many process un"

All incidents associated with regulated substances, including those with the potential to cause any injury or damage, are investigated.  The RMP Program regulations require the reporting of accident histories involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site. There have been no accidents involving ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or denaturant (natural gasoline) in the last 5 years that triggered accident history reporting (no accidents resulted in death, injury, property damage, evacuation, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage off-site).   \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program  \n\nIngredion maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of any hazardous substance.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties including sheltering-i"

Ingredion workers will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, workers evacuate the area and contact the Cedar Rapids Fire Department (HAZMAT).\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Ingredion is coordinated with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department and the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Ingredion has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) and LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, Ingredion conducts periodic emergency drills for all facility personnel and has worked with both the LEPC and emergency response organizations on county-wide chemical emergency response training. Ingredion involves local responders in refresher training on the hazards of regulated substances in the Ingredion facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIngredion constantly strives to improve its safety performance and minimize potential impact on the environment. Active safety and environmental teams and committees, routine audits and inspections, an effective incident investigation procedure, routine PHA's, and community involvement all provide input on improvement opportunities.  Ingredion will continue to utilize these programs and the elements of its PSM program to identify opportunities to improve safety in our facility.\n\nIngredion periodically conducts emergency responses drills. The most recent drill was in July, 2016 with participation from the Cedar Rapids fire department. Ingredion intends to continue utilizing drills because they are"
