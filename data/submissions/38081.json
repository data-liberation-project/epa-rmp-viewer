The chlorine is used for oxidation of iron and manganese in well water prior to filtration, and to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves,  metered through manually-adjusted rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Sacramento County Water Agency that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Sacramento County Water Agency has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a contractual arrangement with DWQ who maintains a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and who in addition maintains a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sacramento County Water Agency are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  Sacramento County Water Agency has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering the chlorination process at the Calvine Meadows WTP.

These include relocation of the chlorine leak sensor and relief vents, and installation of  seismic restraints for the ton container scales.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSacramento County Water Agency's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination, and with the Elk Grove Fire Department, the local agency responsible for Incident Command activities.  Sacramento County DWQ maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at sites which it operates and maintains under contractual arrangement with Sacramento Water Agency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Sacramento County Water Agency committed to accomplish are complete or in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."

The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.
