This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Cambridge Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise, and Isanti County Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, thirty-two 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in\n\nCambridge, Minnesota.  The maximum amount stored 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 52,700 gallons (271,194 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP*Comp was used to determine the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios. Maps are provided to show area of influence for both cases.\n\n\n\n  4.
