Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Lea Refining Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Petroleum refining.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane and Propane.  Butane and Propane are distilled from the crude oil feed, stabilized, then transported offsite via pipeline as a combined stream.                                  .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Butane at our facility is 7701 lb. while Propane is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 2300 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the potentially impacted distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  This was selected as the basis for the calculations since it generally predicts distances on the high side as compared to more sophisticated models. Scenarios evaluated included both chemical-specific releases and releases of mixtures.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nLight Ends  qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst case scenario for this process 5001 lb. of Flam.

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.14 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  This distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.  \n \nSince this is a program level 1 process, no alternative release scenario is required.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The refinery has an active program in place to maintain compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLea  Refining Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If or HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 5/16/97.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lea Refining Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLea Refining Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Lea Refining Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed on 3/6/95.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Lea Refining Company.  The most recent review was performed on 3/3/97.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLea Refining Company conducts audits on a r"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLea Refining Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
