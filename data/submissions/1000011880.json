      "SummaryText": "Quality and Regulatory Affairs (QRA) representatives.  \n\nThe Linweld facility at Oakland NE is an Acetylene manufacturer.  At this facility we produce, pump and transport Acetylene to our other retail sites.  This process is accomplished through the use of an acetylene generator in which Calcium Carbide is mixed with water to produce acetylene gas which is then purified, dried and pumped to various size cylinders.  These cylinders are shipped to our other retail locations for resale.  The slurry that is produced by this process is pumped to a slurry pond where the water is allowed to naturally evaporate.   When the resulting calcium is dried it is removed and disposed of.   \n\nPresently the total quantity of pure acetylene that is handled and stored on this site is approximately 37,920 pounds.  Acetylene is pumped from the generator to the compressors at 8 p.s.i..  From the compressors the acetylene is pumped to the cylinders at between 200 and 300 p.s.i..   All of the cylinders contain a specific amount of acetone depending on the size of the cylinder being filled.  The acetone and acetylene chemically bond so that the acetylene is suspended in a stable condition for transport and use.  This creates a Flammable Chemical Mixture in that by EPA definition, the regulated substance present in a mixture and the concentration of the substance is above one percent by weight of the mixture.  The total amount of pure acetone present at the facility can reach 38,666 pounds in storage and in the cylinders. Because of the number of different size cylinders this facility can fill, the measurements taken were based on maximum potential size of the cylinders being that can be filled at the same time."
