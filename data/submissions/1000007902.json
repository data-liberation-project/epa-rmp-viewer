Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe East Water Purification Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the East Water Purification Plant's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur unforeseeably, the East Plant's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  In the event of a release, Drinking Water Operations has an assigned spill response coordinator in addition to the City of Houston Safety Department. The facility is also completely coordinated with the City of Houston's Hazardous Materials Response Unit and the City of Galena Park Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe East Water Purification Plant's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area.  There are two regulated substances present at the facility, chlorine and ammonia.  The regulated substances are both used in the disinfection process.  A Risk Management Plan for ammonia is no longer required due to the decrease in the percent concentration being below 20%. Chlorine will be the only substance reported in this RMP update.  However, the accident history for ammonia will be reported.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 568,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the East Water Purification Plant's stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe East Water Purification Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is inspection of the plant to identify deficiencies throughout the system. Work orders are then generated for corrective measures.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and are revalidated routinely.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner, with hazard items being deemed high priority and corrected first.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within its covered processes, the East Water Purification Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe East Water Purification Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are responsible for processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe East Water Purification Plant carries out highly documented maintena"
