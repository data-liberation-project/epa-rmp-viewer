The quantity of ClO2 stored in each tank, based on a maximum concentration of 13.5 grams per liter (g/l) (1.35% by weight), is 19,140 pounds (lbs).

The tank area layout and elevation was designed to avoid the formation and retention of a liquid pool of ClO2. The ClO2 solution released will flow to the closest process sewer manhole where it will be routed through a generally closed system to the wastewater treatment system where, in turn, it will become neutralized.

The Woodland mill assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM/RMP Rule and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the PSM/RMP Rule and also whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operations of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5.2   Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, The Woodland Mill has implemented safety features specific to the CLO2 process. Chlorine Dioxide is produced at the facility and stored as a diluted aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where the CLO2 is absorbed in solution. From the absorber, the solution is pumped to storage tanks. From these tanks the CLO2 solution is pumped as needed to the bleach plant where the solution is used to bleach the brown stock pulp.\r\n\r\n1.6    Five - Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years from the chlorine dioxide process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries,"

Hot Work Permit: \r\nThe Woodland Mill has established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the mill. The facility reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit form to comply with these requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form. The supervisor reviews the completed form before work can be initiated.\r\n\r\n10. Management of Change(MOC): \r\nThe Woodland Mill's Management Of Change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be replacements in kind are allowed without completing a MOC form. All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of the process changes are prevented, safety consequences of the changes are addressed, affected process safety information and operating procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n11.
