Dulcich & Sons cold storage facility located near McFarland, California.  As it is Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons\u00bf policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed during 1995-96 in accordance with the 1991 Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Codes.  In 2005, two cold storage rooms were added to the refrigeration system .  The 2006 facility expansion included two more cold storage rooms and two new precoolers.  The 2005 and 2006 expansions were done in according to the 2001 California Mechanical Code.  \n\nAdditionally, Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration systems.  As part of the PSM program, Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons completed process hazard analyses.  Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons utilizes contractors to implement a preventative maintenance program and mechanical integrity program to ensure that the refrigeration equipment is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nPersonnel from Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration systems.  All service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration systems are contracted to a qualified and licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Jakov P. Dulci"

At least every three years, Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been implemented by Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process is being compiled.\n\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00bf Written operating procedures will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\n\n\u00bf If employees are involved in operating the ammonia system, they will receive initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n\u00bf Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n\u00bf A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n\u00bf Pre-startup safety reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n\u00bf Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n\u00bf Inciden"

Dulcich & Sons has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to a partner in the firm.  The partner has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nJakov P. Dulcich & Sons has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nJakov P. Dulcich & Sons has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nJakov P. Dulcich & Sons relies on the expertise of qualified ammonia refrigeration contractors to regularly evaluate the need for any changes to the refrigeration equipment and to improve safety.  Currently, Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons does not have any changes planned to improve safety associated with the ammonia refrigeration system."
