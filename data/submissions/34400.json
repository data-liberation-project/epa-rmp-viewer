General accidental release and prevention policy of Morningstar Foods.\n\nAt Morningstar Foods processing facility we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant during our dairy product manufacturing process.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and the environment.  \n\nIt is our policy at Morningstar Foods to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nMorningstar Foods, 100 East Chestnut Street, Murray, Kentucky, operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration"

      "SummaryText": "system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no\nconsequence.\n\nMorningstar Foods facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain processing, storage room and product tank temperatures required for the processing and storage of our product. There are approximately 250 employees at this facility, including hourly and salary personnel. They manufacture and prepare shipment of refrigerated dairy products via truck approximately 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n  \nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \n\n\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with it's dominant physical characteristic being a very pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \n\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn, but only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n\n     The following administrative and engineering controls are in place at Morningstar Foods. These controls are designed to eliminate, or reduce the possibilities of an accidental release from the refrigeration system. \n\n *  Electronic ammonia detection installed in compressor room, upper and lower coolers.  Alarm system activates a local audible alarm to alert plant personnel of the potential ammonia leak in the monitored areas. \n*  High liquid level switches are configured to accumulators. High level switches will shut down associated compressor operation during a high level conditio"

      "SummaryText": "n.\n* All compressors are configured with critical safety controls (high pressure, low pressure, high oil temp cut-outs, etc.) to shut down the respective compressor in the event of an abnormal operating condition.\n*  Safety Relief Valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressor oil separators to eliminate over pressurization conditions in those associated pieces of equipment.\n*  Periodic Maintenance Program is contracted through a reputable refrigeration company to ensure the refrigeration system and it's components are kept in optimum mechanical and operating status. Weekly inspections are conducted by the refrigeration contractor. Rounds are made each shift three times a day by plant personnel to verify proper equipment operation.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history.\n\nMorningstar Foods facility has had no significant accidental releases to report over the last five years.\n\n5.   Emergency Action Program\n\nThe purpose of the Morningstar Foods Emergency Action Plan is to:\n\n     1.   Minimize exposure to our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a hazardous material release or spill.\n\n     2.  Assure the safe emergency evacuation of the plant in the instance that it is required.\n\n     3.  Provide for prompt medical attention to any employees who become seriously injured or ill at work.\n\n     4.  Facility management has developed an Emergency Response Plan to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials. \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan currently meets requirements as set forth in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plans."
