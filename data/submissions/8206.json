Chlorine is used in the treatment process as a disinfectant.  There are four (4) one ton cylinders stored on site.  Two (2) cylinders are stored as back-up supplies, while the other two (2) cylinders are in use.  A common manifold connects the cylinders in use.  Chlorine gas is fed by pressure to a pressure reducer.  From that point gas is fed through a chlorinating system by vacuum where it is mixed in water.  The chlorinated water goes into the treatment process at two (2) different locations.  One application point is on top of the filters; the other is in the potable water storage clearwell.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies:        The City of Springfield takes the safe handling of chlorine and the safety of its employees and neighbors very seriously.  A policy has been developed and administered for the practice of handling and feeding chlorine at the Springfield Water Plant.  Certain steps are taken to assure that there is no accidental release of chlorine gas in the facility.  Operators are well trained on how to handle chlorine as well as what steps to take in the event of a chlorine leak.  Chlorine leak detectors are installed in both the chlorine storage and the chlorine feeder rooms.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:    The worst case scenario would be a 10 minute leak of 400 pounds of chlorine gas per minute, resulting in a total of 4000 pounds of chlorine.  This would have an end point of 3 miles from point of leak, affecting an estimated 255 individuals.  All affected people are residential.  There are no industries, schools, or businesses in this range.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:    The alternative release scenario would be a 10 minute leak of one pound per minute resulting in a total of 10 pounds of chlorine.  This would have an end point of 0.10 mil from point of leak, affecting 2 individuals.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention P"

      "SummaryText": "rogram:    The following is a list of precautions that are to be taken in handling chlorine, feeding chlorine, and the maintenance of chlorine equipment:\nEach cylinder shall be inspected, fusible plugs checked, and valves checked for leaks upon arrival.  If the integrity of the cylinder does not seem sound or if there are any signs of leakage, the cylinder shall not be received and must be removed from the premises.\nAll equipment used in the chlorinating process will be checked each time the chlorine cylinders are changed.  Any equipment will be replaced if the integrity of that equipment is in question.  Chlorine leak detectors and exhaust fans will be checked monthly and serviced annually.  Pressure reducers and chlorinators will be cleaned and serviced annually by a trained technician.\n\nAll employees shall be made aware of the hazards of chlorine on their first day of work.  They shall be shown the material safety data sheets and the Process Safety Management Plan.  Each employee will be trained in the safe handling of chlorine, leak repair, and the use of a SCBA.  They will receive refresher courses once every three years.\n\nThere are two (2) scenarios to consider in the event of a catastrophic release of chlorine.   \n1. If there is one operator on duty the following applies:  He/she shall turn off High Service Pumps and immediately leave the premises.  They are to call emergency response team from nearest phone at safe distance.  They are to return, staying at a safe distance and secure area and wait for emergency response team to arrive.\n2. If there are more than one operator on duty the following applies:  They are to shut plant down and immediately leave premises.  One individual is to remain at safe distance and secure area.  The other individuals are to go to nearest phone and call emergency response team.  They are to return to where they had dropped off first individual and wait for response team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Team:    \n\nTrent Morris                    Springfield"
