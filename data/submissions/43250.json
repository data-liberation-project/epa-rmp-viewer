We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including-\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n- The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n2.0     STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces titanium dioxide (Ti02) using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. We produce titanium dioxide, a hiding agent used in paint, paper and plastics, is produced via the chloride process. In the Chloride process, titanium bearing ore, chlorine and petroleum coke are combined to produce titanium tetrachloride. The titanium tetrachloride is subsequently oxidized to titanium dioxide using phosphorus trichloride. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\nHazardous Material\n\nUse at Facility\nChlorine (Cl2)\nProduction of titanium tetrachloride\nTitanium tetrachlorid"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n- Process safety information (i.e. process technology)\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Operating procedures and safe work practices (including hot work)\n- Training and performance\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Quality assurance\n- Management of change (technology and subtle)\n- Pre-startup review\n- Compliance audits\n- Incident investigation and reporting\n- Employee participation\n- Hot work\n- Contractors (safety and performance)\n- Management of change-personnel\n- Emergency planning and response\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.0     FIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. There were no significant accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years.\n\n5.0     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which meets all the requirements stated in the RMP rule. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations"
