Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by rail car, mixed with phosphoric acid then distributed to area farms as a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer (10-34-0). \n\nMaximum Quantity Stored in the largest stationary source at this site is 145,00 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in a  33,600 gallon rail car tank. The maximum quantity handled would be a rail car loaded with 145,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. A Maximum of two Anhydrous Ammonia cars could be on site at one time, although only one at a time can be connected and off-loaded. \n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car tank, released as a gas over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity released would be 145,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest stationary storage tank at the facility at 85 percent capacity, as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.40 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimated to release 11,908 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.41 miles.   \n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis facility has no permanent Anhydrous Ammonia storage, but will follow the appropriate portions of the following rules when an Anhydrous Ammonia rail car is on the siding: Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S."

Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. This is a new process for this location.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
