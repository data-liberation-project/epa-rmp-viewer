Normally this carbon dioxide is vented to the atmosphere, but it is collected and transferred to our facility via pipeline. The CO2 is purified and liquified using a simple process of compression and distillation. The liquid carbon dioxide is stored in our insulated storage tanks and shipped by truck to customers throughout the country.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances-\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA;\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant in the carbon dioxide liquefaction process.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy-\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs.  Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program -\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Muscatine, Iowa facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nAn Anhydrous Ammonia atmospheric monitoring system is installed to ensure the safety of our employees and the community. A carbon dioxide monitoring system is also in place. This enhances our capability to detect minor leaks before they become major events. The system is tied into the plant logic control system that will alert the operator (monitored 24 hours a day) should a leak occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History-\r\nThe Muscatine, Iowa facility history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years.

The Fire Department has a station approximately .16 miles from the facility.\r\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety -\r\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of Zero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location.  We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\r\n\r\nUpgrades to the ammonia vent system and sparge tank are in the planning stage."
