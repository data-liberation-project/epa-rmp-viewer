Four containers are connected to vacuum regulators, rotometers and water vacuum ejectors.  The system is completely under vacuum.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a spring loaded valve on each of the regulators immediately closes to stop the flow of chlorine gas.\nThe chlorine storage system is constructed of standard concrete block with red brick facing approximately 14\" thick.  The building has a total volume of 5,081 cubic feet with two permanently sealed windows, two delivery bi-fold steel doors which are insulated and gasketed and one steel entrance door which is insulated and gasketed.  The chlorine storage system is monitored by two independent leak detection systems.\nListed below is a brief description of  B.T.M.U.A.'s risk management program as it pertains to the location detailed above.\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n1. The goal of BTMUA's Risk Management Program  (RMP) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine.  BTMUA's delineation of this RMP element details responsibilities which involves Directors, Supervisors, Regulatory Compliance Officer and Health and Safety Officer.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n2. BTMUA's RMP includes chlorine information on its toxicity, physical data, permissible exposure limits, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data.

The Director of Technical Operations has overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this RMP element in conjunction with the Process Control Supervisor and Health and Safety Officer.\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n3. BTMUA has conducted Chlorination Process Hazard Analysis to identify, evaluate and control the risk associated with the hazards of the chlorination process.  Process Hazard Analysis Documentation includes analysis reports, dispersion modeling reports, action timetables and a record of meetings held in which process hazard analysis results are communicated. The Director of Technical Operations implements the PHA planning in coordination with the Technical Maintenance Supervisor and Health and Safety Officer.  These PHA's are conducted and throughly reviewed and re-validated at least every five (5) years following the completion of the initial report by an in house hazard analysis team.\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP'S)\n4.  The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure that BTMUA maintains up-to-date accurate,     written SOP's that provide clear instructions for our chlorination system.  All procedures     will contain simplified operating instructions as well as any attachments.  These procedures are reviewed annually to certify that they accurately reflect current operating practice.  Any revisions to SOP's that include changes in our process chemical, technology and equipment and facility changes will be addressed in our management of change.

This training consists of classroom and hands-on formats.  Refresher training is given periodically throughout the year based on regulatory requirements and operational need basis.  Training is monitored in a computer database, Training Tracker.  The Director of Technical Operations, Health and Safety Officer and Technical Maintenance Supervisor share overall responsibility for developing and maintaining this RMP Element.\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY/PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE (P/M)\n6. The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure the continued integrity of all the chlorination process equipment.  The BTMUA PM Program identifies the direct and indirect EHS equipment as well as establishing, following and maintaining maintenance, inspection and testing schedules for this equipment.  The Technical Maintenance Supervisor has the overall responsibility for implementing this RMP Element.\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n7.  The purpose of this RMP is to ensure that BTMUA's chlorination process system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications.  This is to determine that these changes can be accomplished safely and the chlorination system is ready to operate safely in accordance with original system design intent following the implementation of the change.  Included in this element is document review, PHA development, employee training and record keeping.  The Technical Maintenance Supervisor has the overall responsibility for this element is coordination with the Health and Safety Officer.\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\n8.

The Director of Engineering is responsible for administering this RMP element in coordination with the Director of Operations, Technical Maintenance Supervisor, Regulator Compliance Officer, Process Control Supervisor, and Health and Safety Officer. \nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n9. The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate that BTMUA's chlorination process safety and risk management programs, and their implementation for compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA/TCPA Risk Management Program Regulations.  This audit is completed annually under the direction of the Director of Technical Operations in coordination with the Technical Maintenance Supervisor, Process Control Supervisor, and Health and Safety Officer.\nACCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n10. All chlorine leak accidents or potentially catastrophic events at the Authority, will be promptly investigated.  The purpose of the accident investigation element is to identify the underlying causes of an accident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the accident from reoccurring.  The Technical Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for initiating this RMP element and ensures that any resulting corrective actions are addressed and documented. \nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PLAN\n11.
