The emergency teams are; a Pulp Mill Operations HAZMAT Team, trained to HAZMAT Operations level, and an Emergency Response Team, trained to HAZMAT Technician level, which also serves as Rural Response Team 10 for Oxford County.  The Emergency Response Team consists of the following; HAZMAT, Confined Space Rescue, High Angle Rescue, Fire Brigade, Security Team and Medical Staff. All Rumford Mill employees are trained in evacuation procedures.

      "SummaryText": "The ND Paper Inc. - Rumford Division (Rumford Mill) operates a paper manufacturing facility located at 1 County Road, Rumford, Maine that manufactures coated paper and market pulp. The area immediately surrounding the plant is primarily rural with just a few commercial facilities and residential areas. The Androscoggin River is the closest water body and is directly adjacent to the plant. The major routes serving the facility include U.S. Route 2 and Maine Route 108. \nThe only process at the Rumford Mill facility covered by RMP is the chlorine dioxide process which involves the manufacture, storage, and distribution of a 1.2% solution of chlorine dioxide. Specifically the chlorine dioxide process is subject to RMP's Prevention Program 3. Based on a review of chemicals present at the plant, there are no other substances that are covered by RMP.\nPursuant to the RMP rule, owners must include a five-year accident history that identifies all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in: (1) deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or (2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.42. Since the 5-year RMP resubmittal in 2019, one accident qualified for reporting. This accident was added to RMPsubmit on March 22, 2024 within the 6-month regulatory timeframe. The facility responsible official and emergency contact were the only other updates made to RMPsubmit at that time. The facility's 5-year resubmittal is due in June 2024.\nThe Rumford Mill is committed to the safety and health of Rumford workers and the public, preservation of the environment, and prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The mill implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Rumford; a"
