The systems are located in the tank farm area of the plant and operate based on bulk delivery by truck.  Many safeguards are in place and are used throughout the system.  These were repeatedly cited in the hazard review sessions.  These include: administrative controls, such as operating procedures, operator inspection rounds, lockout/tagout procedures, maintenance procedures, employee training, experienced personnel and reliable vendors, sensors and alarms for high or low levels and high or low pressures, and for the presence of anhydrous ammonia or chlorine.  Also identified are dsign safeguards such a relief  valves, excess flow valves, check valves, and high pressure shutdowns.  Additionaly, the prevention program contains the remaining elements required for  program level 2 processes, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training , maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.",
