ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nPhillips 66 (P66), as the managing partner of Sweeny Cogeneration Limited Partnership is committed to proactively protecting human health, safety and the environment.  The Sweeny Cogeneration Facility, which is part of the Sweeny Refinery, has a long standing commitment to the environment and to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs, and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery consists of four major facilities, which are linked by multiple pipelines and operates as a single unit. The main plant, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and Old FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. We also operate terminals and storage facilities in Freeport, Jones Creek, and San Bernard. The refinery covers approximately 3,000 acres at the four locations; the plant processes 247,000 barrels per day of crude oil and produces 125,000 barrels per day of gasoline. The Sweeny Cogeneration Facility uses the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant, offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics: Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nFlammables: None over RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and comm"

Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario. The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios. In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\n\n\n\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Sweeny Refinery.  Because processes at the plant are subject to both EPA Risk Management Program Rule and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance, this summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery management supports and encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information cre"

In addition, Sweeny Refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming problem-solving teams to promote both process safety and employee safety.\n\n\n\nPersonnel representing operations, maintenance, support, and management work together on the Employee Excellence Team to represent facility employees involving the following areas:\n\n\n\n- Employee Ownership and VPP (Behavior Based Safety Process, Safety in Motion, ergonomics, traffic safety,general        safety, safety concerns),\n\n- Pollution Prevention (recycling programs, waste prevention and minimization, wildlife tours),  \n\n- Safety Standards and Procedures (review, edit, create, and audit)\n\n- Process Safety (process safety metrics, Process Safety Event lessons-learned, communication and re-education of PSM/process safety).\n\n\n\nB. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used for the safe and reliable operation of facility processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific teams/groups within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining current and up to date process safety information. Process safety information documents are readily available for review and use (e.g. during unit process hazard analysis, etc.). The refinery Management of Change (MOC) process is utilized to maintain process safety information current and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) in the unit "

The respective teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and instrumented protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, etc.).  \n\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are also maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA formal PHA process is established to help ensure that potential process-related hazards are identified and controlled. Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations. Additional PHA tools and methodologies (e.g., Layers of Protection Analysis, What-If, etc.) are utilized based on need and appropriateness for the process under review. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise.\n\n\n\nAny PHA findings or recommendations identified are forwarded to the respective team management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate priority attention. All approved mitigation options being"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include: unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program consisting of various job/certification models for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Contractors\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery uses contractors as part of its regular work force and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to help verify contractors have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the potential hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and procedures, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they may discover during the course of their work. Various information is communicated and provided to contractors to help accomplish this to include:\n\n- Process overviews,\n\n- Information regarding safety and health hazards (e.g., SDSs),\n\n- Emergency Response Plan information,\n\n- Safe work practices applicable to contractor work activities.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as part of the contractor selection process. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Meetings are held monthly with facility contractors and plant personnel to promote effective information sharing and to ensure site and work requirements are adequately communicated.\n\n\n\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\n\n\nAs required by the OSHA PSM standard and in accordance with the EPA RMP Accident Prevention Program requirements, the Sweeny Refinery conducts PSSRs for any new facility or when existing facilities/processes are modified and requires a change in the process safety information. The intent of the PSSR is to confirm various features are in place prior to placing the equipment in service, such as: proper haz"
