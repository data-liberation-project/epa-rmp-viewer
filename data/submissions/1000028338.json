      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nChesapeake Energy has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Chesapeake policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nChesapeake operates the Smokehouse Compressor Facility located in Logan County, West Virginia. This facility receives gas from pipeline. Condensate and water are separated from the inlet stream. The gas is compressed then dried, and NGLs removed. The NGL product is stored in one (1) of two (2) 30,000 gallon storage tanks. The residue gas (methane) is routed back into a gas pipeline.  The Smokehouse Compressor Facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels. This facility is classified as a Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Smokehouse Compressor Facility. Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nChesapeake and the Smokehouse Compressor Facility actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered proce"

Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities and experience.\n\n\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nChesapeake maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards. This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as design basis/configuration information for key process parameters. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems. The plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Smokehouse Co"

This technique is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. The Smokehouse Compressor Facility assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates. The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\n\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1)    Initial startup.\n\n(2)    Normal operations. \n\n(3)    Temporary operations. \n\n(4)    Emergency shutdown.\n\n(5)    Emergency operations.\n\n(6)    Normal shutdown.\n\n(7)    Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. \n\n\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.

Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Facility issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process. The Smokehouse Compressor Facility provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of one (1) year following completion of work.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Facility periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n(1)    Are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform their job. \n\n(2)    Have received and understood the training required and carry a training document card while on location.\n\n(3)    Follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices. \n\n(4)    Advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor.\n\n(5)    Notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.\n\n\n\n \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
