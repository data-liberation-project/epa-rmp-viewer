This summary provides an overview of the facilities Risk Management Program.\n\nPOLICY\n\nClariant LSM is committed to operating our facilities safely and in compliance with all applicable regulations.  Clariant LSM considers proper management of Environmental, Safety and Health considerations as an integral component of our business.  All employees assume responsibility for process safety consistent with their function and level of authority. \n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nClariant LSM (Missouri) Inc. produces materials for use in pharmaceuticals.  These materials include both intermediate chemicals that are used to produce pharmaceutical active ingredients and the active ingredients themselves.  The facility is located on 66 acres and employs approximately 115 people including many scientists and engineers.  The facility operations are regulated by the FDA, OSHA, DEA, EPA, MDNR and Federal, State and local agencies.\n\nTitanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is used in the manufacturing process for a pharmaceutical intermediate.  The EPA Risk Management Planning Threshold Quantity for titanium tetrachloride is 2500 lbs.  The facility purchases TiCl4 in cylinders with net weight of 1500 lbs.  Two cylinders may be connected to the manufacturing process simultaneously, so the manufacturing process maximum inventory is 3000 lbs.  Titanium tetrachloride is received in cylinders which are stored in a dedicated warehouse.  The maximum intended inventory in the warehouse is 12 cylinders (18,000 lbs).  The normal warehouse inventory will be 6,000-12,000 lbs.  \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION-TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE\n\nTitanium tetrachloride is used in a single manufacturing process at Clariant LSM.  The maximum intended inventory for TiCl4 in the manufacturing process is two cylinders (3000 lbs).    Therefore, this process is covered for titanium tetrachloride and P"

Sprinkler piping in the warehouse is plugged to reduce the risk of introducing water.  It is segregated from all processing facilities, offices, and other high-traffic / high-population areas.  The flooring in the warehouse is designed to contain any spills within the structure.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nThis facility has been in operation since 1947.  The site has mature safety programs that meet or exceed OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  Clariant LSM has developed prevention programs for all regulated chemicals.  The success of these prevention programs is reflected in Clariant LSM's excellent safety performance.  Clariant LSM's prevention programs are comprised of technology-, personnel-, and facilities-related elements.\n\nTechnology-related elements include safety systems in the processes (control systems, alarms, interlocks, monitoring systems), process hazards analysis (PHA), operating procedures and safe practices, and management of change (MOC).  These elements are utilized to manage all physical, procedural, and technical changes made on this site.  A plant-wide database is used for tracking MOCs and PHAs.  \n\nFacilities-related elements that significantly contribute to the success of the prevention program include the mechanical integrity program and the pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR). The mechanical integrity program is a comprehensive program that is responsible for equipment compliance with Good Engineering Practices (GEPs), proper equipment preventative maintenance, and equipment quality assurance.  \n\nPersonnel-related elements include formal training and incident investigation.  Both of these programs utilize database systems to maintain and organize records so that site personnel are able to track plant performance in these areas.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn accordance with RMP reporti"

      "SummaryText": "ng requirements, Clariant LSM is pleased to report that there have been zero accidental releases from Clariant LSM that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  There have also been no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\n\nClariant LSM (Missouri) Inc. has established a complete integrated contingency response plan to define the procedures and activities necessary to manage chemical incidents.  All operators and maintenance mechanics complete a 24-hour certified hazardous material training course and conduct emergency response exercises approximately every 3 months.  All shift supervisors complete certified emergency response incident command training.\n\nClariant LSM works closely with the Springfield Fire Department, Local Emergency Planning Committee and Emergency Management Office to assure these planning and response organizations are familiar with the Clariant LSM site.  Joint emergency response exercises are periodically conducted with the Springfield Fire Department at the Clariant LSM facility to assure the fire department Hazardous Material Teams are familiar with the Clariant LSM site and can work effectively with the Clariant LSM HazMat teams.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nClariant LSM believes continuous improvement of all environmental and safety systems is crucial to the ongoing success of the company.  Several ongoing safety programs are in place to assure means of improving site safety performance are fully explored.  All incidents are reported and investigated to assure causative factors are identified and corrected.  Plant safety committees meet regularly to discuss safety and encourage employees to voice any suggestions they may have.  These and other programs have resulted in numerous improvements to safety at Clariant LSM and will continue to do so."
