This belief covers on and off-job injuries, occupational illnesses and accidental releases.  DuPont is also committed to keeping its facilities ready to respond to any incident that occurs in spite of our best prevention efforts.\n\n\n\nDuPont established process safety management (PSM) on a Corporate basis in 1979.  General definitions, policies and organizational structure that implement PSM are outlined in Section S21A of the DuPont Safety, Health, and environmental (SHE)  standards.  PSM goals, policies and procedures are embodied in numerous corporate manuals and documents such as Engineering Standards, Safety Manuals and Guidelines.\n\n\n\nDuPont's La Porte Plant endorses, adheres to and carries out Corporate PSM policies, procedures and guidelines.  The DuPont La Porte Plant's Accidental Release Prevention policies come within the scope of the site's existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We apply PSM to all processes and chemicals at this site, not just those covered by the RMP Regulation.\n\n\n\nThe stated purpose of the La Porte Plant's PSM Program is to manage and control the hazards in our processes, to protect individuals, plant equipment, our business integrity, and our community through the elimination of hazards.  PSM involves the application of controls to our processes through operating & maintenance procedures and practices, training, management of change, equipment inspection, and auditing.\n\n\n\nThe Principles that govern the DuPont La Porte Plant's PSM actions are:\n\n--All injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are"

All elements of the site's Risk Management Program, including safety, regulatory compliance, prevention of accidental spills and releases, and emergency response fall within the scope of the Plant Manager's responsibilities.  Safety is also considered to be each employee's individual responsibility.\n\n\n\nBelow the Plant Manager level, there are two Unit Operation Leaders (one for each of the Crop Protection businesses)who report to the Plant Manager.  Each Unit Operation Leader is responsible for Process Safety Management (PSM), spill/release prevention, regulatory compliance and many aspects of Emergency Response within his/her individual Business.  Reporting to the Plant Manager is a Site Safety, Health, Environmental(SHE) and Security Ma"

Security personnel are on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to observe and control all site ingress and egress and to perform frequent on-site and perimeter patrols.  A strict accounting is kept of everyone present at the facility - including employees, visitors, vendors, contractors and delivery personnel.  Vehicular access is tightly controlled.  Security personnel inspect all inbound and outbound vehicles. Continual perimeter monitoring is maintained by a series of recorded fixed and pan tilt-zoom (PTz) cameras, displayed to Security Personnel at the Main Gate.\n\n \n\nCovered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulated substances and covered processes at this facility are:\n\n\n\nCovered Process       Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nLannate(R)            Chlorine\n\n                      Methyl Mercaptan\n\n\n\nHerbicides            Dimethylamine\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the processes listed above is a Program 3 Process.

Our RMP information was actively communicated to the public in a series of \"Roll-out\" events conducted in February and March 1999.  Community dialogue about Risk Management is an on-going process particularly through efforts with our local Citizens' Advisory Council and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The RMP has been shared with the City of La Porte Office of Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the five years immediately preceding the resubmittal of this RMPlan, there were two accidental releases of a RMP regulated substance from a covered process at the DuPont La Porte Plant that resulted in on-site injuries and fatalities. During this period, there were no accidental spills or releases of RMP regulated substance that resulted in known off site deaths, evacuations, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL- SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nDuPont's La Porte Plant is regulated by and complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation - 29 CFR 1910.119. Our PSM compliance program is directed toward preventing all serious process related chemical incidents that might affect plant personnel (employees, contractors, visitors) off-site communities, or the environment, or result in significant loss of property or business.

An Emergency Response Team (ERT) is on duty at the facility 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\n\n\nThe sounding of the site-wide alarm also initiates a number of other processes including:\n\n  --mobilization of site emergency response resources\n\n  --preliminary assessment of the situation\n\n  --personnel accounting\n\n  --dispersion modeling to gauge the potential for off-site impact\n\n  --establishment of a Command Post near the incident location\n\n\n\nAt the Command Post, an Incident Commander (IC) takes charge of the situation and organizes and directs the ERT response.  The site's Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained in incident command, interior structural firefighting, fume and vapor suppression, emergency medical treatment (including cardiac care), high angle / confined space rescue, and hazardous material response.
