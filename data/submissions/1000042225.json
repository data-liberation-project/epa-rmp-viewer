      "SummaryText": "Puritan Products, Inc. is a customer blender and wholesale distributor of industrial chemicals.  The facility is located at 2290 Avenue A in Bethlehem, PA. Regulated substances handled at the facility include hydrochloric acid (37%), ammonium hydroxide (29%), and hydrofluoric acid (53%).  Hydrochloric acid (37%) is delivered by tank wagon to either a 5,300-gallon tank at the facility or to drums.  Ammonium hydroxide (29%) is delivered by tank wagon to either a 7,000-gallon tank at the facility or to drums.  Hydrofluoric acid (53%) is delivered by common carrier in 500-pound drums.  The hydrofluoric acid is not processed in any way.  It is simply relabeled.  Therefore discussion of hydrofluoric acid in this document is limited in comparison to the hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.\n\n\n\nPuritan maintains a detailed emergency response plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 and 25 PA Code 264, Subchapter D (264.51 through 264.56).  The Executive Vice President serves as facility coordinator and incident commander for implementation of the emergency response plan. Employees are trained to respond to accidental releases at the facility.  The plan is coordinated with the LEPC and included in the community off-site release plan.\n\n\n\nBecause the facility is one 50,700 square foot building, the hydrochloric acid, ammonium hydroxide, and hydrofluoric acid are considered to be materials that could potentially be released at the same time in the event of an explosion.  There the Risk Management Plan is presented as one covered process, chemical distribution, with three regulated chemicals.  The worst-case release is defined by the EPA as the release of the contents of the largest container. Although the ammonium hydroxide tank is larger, a release of the 5,300 gallon HCl tank was modeled as the worst case scenario because of a greater distance of potential off-site impact.  The amount in the HCl tank is administratively controlled to an operating level of 4,770 gallons.  T"

      "SummaryText": "his tank is located inside the building within a diked area with a capacity of 6,237 gallons.   The dike and the building provide passive mitigation in the event of the worst-case release.  The three alternate case release scenarios considered were the release of a drum of hydrochloric acid (37%), the release of a drum of ammonium hydroxide (29%), and the release of a drum of hydrofluoric acid (53%) at the loading dock, the closest point to the outside air.\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis was performed using the guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors\" in combination with RMP Comp Version 1.07.  For the worst-case analysis the EPA specified conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed, F stability class, and ambient temperature were used.  Urban conditions apply because of the industrial park surroundings of the facility.  The toxic endpoint for HCl is 0.030 mg/l.  Modelling as a ten-minute release, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is 0.2 miles.  This would affect other facilities in the industrial park, but no residential areas or environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nEach alternate release scenario was also modelled using the same guidance information for chemical distributors in combination with RMP Comp Version 1.07.  A wind speed of 3 m/s and D stability class atmosphere were used per EPA guidance.  A release of one drum of HCl, ammonium hydroxide, or hydrofluoric acid outside at the loading dock would have the potential to affect only the immediate industrial neighbors.  The distance to endpoint in each case is 0.1 miles or less.\n\n\n\nThe release of the entire contents of a tank wagon that is unloading HCl or ammonium hydroxide is in transportation and, therefore, exempt from this regulation.  However, it should be noted that because this accident would happen outside that a greater range of off-site receptors may be affected by such an accident.  Unloading does occur in a diked area with a sump to pump "

In addition, a sprinkler system and emergency response procedures would prevent the spread of the fire.  An alarm system would immediately notify all employees and the fire department.  However, it should be noted that a catastrophic fire could also have worse off-site consequences than the worst-case release of the HCl tank contents.\n\n\n\nPuritan Products, Inc. has taken precautions to ensure that releases of toxic chemicals do not affect any off-site receptors.  Prevention measures for the HCl tank include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Hydrostatic tank and water head testing\n\n?    Continuous tank level indicator\n\n?    High level alarm interlocked with a fail-closed valve in the tankwagon supply line\n\n?    Conservation vent releasing to acid scrubber\n\n?
