The facility accomplishes this goal by utilizing chlorine to disinfect the reclaimed water thus protecting public health and the environment from such pathogens.  If released to the atmosphere in sufficient quantities, chlorine can be harmful to humans and/or the environment.  The Camp Creek WPCP has developed a Risk Management Plan and Program to help prevent a harmful release of chlorine and to be prepared to respond in case such a release occurs.  Please note, the current chlorine disinfection process is scheduled to be replaced by an ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system by September 2001.\n\nFor the disinfection process, worst-case and alternative scenarios were developed to assess the possible consequences of accidental releases of chlorine.  The worst-case scenario involved estimation of the impact of a rapid, substantial release under worst-case, atypical weather conditions, however unlikely the conditions and parameters might be.  The developed alternative scenario estimates the impact based on more realistic release parameters under typical meteorological conditions.  Specifically, the worst-case scenario for chlorine involved the release of the entire contents of a single chlorine vessel, while the alternative case described the results of a failure of the subheader connected to the chlorine vessel.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-developed and -approved software package, RMP*Comp, was utilized to estimate the toxic endpoint d"

      "SummaryText": "istances for the release scenarios.  Another EPA-approved software package, LandView III, as well as other available information, were employed to identify public and environmental receptors within the extents identified by RMP*Comp.  Specific values from these calculations are provided in Sections 2 through 5 of the Risk Management Plan found in Appendix F and Chapter 2 of the overall Risk Management Program.  The calculations did not account for active or passive mitigation measures.  There have been no accidents involving substantial chlorine release that resulted in on-site or off-site injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place within the past 5 years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan which is coordinated with the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency/Fulton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Fire Department.  The Camp Creek WPCP is prepared to respond by assessing the hazard level of a release, and correcting or interrupting incidental leaks.  The LEPC/Fire Department will respond to substantial releases as well as any release that is identified as migrating off the Camp Creek WPCP property.  The LEPC/Fire Department will notify the public if an imminent health threat is determined to exist.\n\nTo help prevent accidental releases of chlorine, the Camp Creek WPCP has developed a Prevention Program (EPA Program 2).  The Prevention Program includes the following key elements:\n\n7 safety information and equipment (such as automatic shutoffs, chlorine detectors)\n7 hazard review of equipment and procedures\n7 safe and standard operating procedures\n7 operator training\n7 preventive maintenance program\n7 compliance auditing program\n7 incident investigation program\n\nThe Camp Creek WPCP has identified opportunities to increase the safety of the facility, the public, and the environment.  The primary safety enhancement will be accomplished by the installation of the UV disinfection system.  Ad"
