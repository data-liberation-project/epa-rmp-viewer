This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for distribution. Ethyl mercaptan is present on site for use as an odorant for the propane, but the quantity of mercaptan onsite is below the threshold quantity for the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Demopolis Terminal. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's \r\nPSM Standard.  \r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Demopolis Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Demopolis Terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is"

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n* An overview of our emergency response program\r\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Demopolis Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of propane tank trucks. The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility receives, stores and distributes LPG.  There are two tanks with a capacity of approximately 90,000 gallons each.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, propane dehydration vessels, propane odorization"

The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Demopolis Terminal is coordinated with the Marengo County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Demopolis Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Demopolis Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Demopolis Terminal.\r\n\r\n* The Demopolis Terminal plans to install a redundant shutdown valve for additional overpressure protection of the storage vessels."
