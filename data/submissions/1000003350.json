Eastman has approximately 5300 customers worldwide and posted 1998 sales of $4.48 billion. With corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Eastman employs 16,100 people in more than 30 countries.\n\nThe Texas Eastman Division of Eastman Chemical Company has its Tyler Terminal facility located on a 320-acre site in Smith County near Tyler, Texas.  The Tyler Terminal facility receives butane, ethylene, propane and propylene by pipeline and truck and stores these materials in above-ground tanks and in underground caverns in a salt dome formation over 1000 feet below the surface.  There are no chemical manufacturing operations at the Tyler Terminal facility.  The materials received and stored at Tyler Terminal are sent by pipeline to the Texas Eastman Longivew plant site where they are used in the manufacture of over 40 different chemical intermediates, solvents, coatings, resins and plastics.  No consumer items are made directly at Texas Eastman.  Instead, the Texas Eastman products are supplied to industrial customers for use in the manufacture of hundreds of consumer items which enhance the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.  These products include automobile interiors, paints, tires, food preservatives, adhesives, furniture, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, disposable baby diapers, food packaging, toys, soft drink bottles, floor polish and waxes, printing inks, latex paint, fiberglass, fabric and many other consumer and industrial products.\n\nRegulated Substances Description\n\nTexas Eastman Division's Tyler Terminal site handles a number of flammable gases listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.

Three examples of flammables handled and stored at the Tyler Terminal facility include ethylene, butane and propane.  All of the gases handled at the Tyler Terminal facility are colorless gaseses with a mild petroleum type odor and all are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nUses:\n\nTexas Eastman Division uses butane and propane as the basic feedstock for the Texas Eastman Longview plant site.  Ethylene is used by the Texas Eastman Longview plant site as one of the basic building blocks for most of the other chemicals produced.\n\nIII.  Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n     -DELETED-\n\nIV. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTexas Eastman Division utilizes a \"layers of protection\" approach to protect people and the environment.  This approach includes, but is not limited to the following elements:\n\nDesigning For Safety\n\n* Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are designed and constructed to strict industry and government standards.\n* Process design and operations are analyzed for safety prior to their installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.\n* Control systems and instruments provide continuous monitoring of operating conditions and alarm operators of upset conditions.\n* Emergency shutdown systems automatically shut down operations to a safe state if emergency conditions develop. \n* Area and equipment are protected by automatic deluge systems to cool the equipment in the event of a fire and disperse flammable or toxic vapors in the event of leaks.\n* Combustible gas monitors are installed in critical locations to sound an alarm and turn on the deluge systems in the event of leaks.\n* Remotely operated isolation valves "
