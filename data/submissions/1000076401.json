      "SummaryText": "The Ultra Dairy, LLC (Ultra) facility manufactures extended shelf life milks, creams, and other dairy products.  As part of its manufacturing operation, Ultra operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system which is used for process cooling. The system was recently expanded and now includes five compressors.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia currently in this process is approximately 13,400 lbs. The approximate maximum that the system can contain is 16,000 lbs.  \n\n\n\nSince the quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Ultra exceeds the Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold of 10,000 lbs., the facility has prepared this RMP to meet the requirements of Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) pursuant to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations contained in Part 68 of Code 40 of the Federal Regulations (40 CFR Part 68), Sections 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  The facility also has a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in place to meet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements of 29 CFR1910.119.  The RMP and PSM plans complement one another to meet both sets of regulations.\n\n\n\nUltra goes to great lengths to maintain its ammonia refrigeration system to prevent releases.  An inspection and maintenance program is in place that includes daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual activities to monitor and maintain the system by trained personnel in an effort to ensure proper, safe operation.  Various safeguards and detection measures are in place to identify a potential problem and to minimize the effect of one should it occur.  The ammonia refrigeration system is stored in an enclosed room. The facility is equipped with ammonia detection sensors in various locations to detect ammonia leaks. Refrigeration system alarms (both visual and audible) are available for high pressure, high temperature and both high and low ammonia levels. Pressure relief valves are present to relieve the syst"

All of the pressure relief valves are vented external to the building and most are directed to a water diffusion tank to further mitigate an ammonia release.  Installation of additional pressure relief valves is planned for 2014 to provide greater protection.  \n\n\n\nUltra provides specific training on the ammonia system to site Maintenance personnel involved in maintaining the ammonia refrigeration system.  Additional, more advanced, training is planned for 2014.  Awareness training on the hazards are provided to all site personnel.  Ultra has an Emergency Action Plan in place to provide guidance in the event of a release.  All employees and site workers receive training on the plan and drills are held to evaluate its effectiveness.  Ultra works with local emergency response personnel to ensure that they are familiar with the key features of the facility, including the ammonia refrigeration system.  Representatives from the local fire department, local Haz Mat team and County Department of Emergency Management were most recently at the site in February 2014.\n\n\n\nUltra strives to promote safety and awareness of the risks associated with anhydrous ammonia and will work to continually improve the RMP/PSM program and the safety of its ammonia refrigeration system.
