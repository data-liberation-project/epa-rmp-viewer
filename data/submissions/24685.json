Facility Policy\n                                                                                   \nThe owners, management and employees of Aredale Farm Center (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Aredale Fire Department, Butler County LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for resale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored at this facility would be 270,000 in a storage tank and nurse tanks.  We have an Emergency Action plan in place and we provide our employees with appropriate training for working with Anhydrous Ammonia.  We update our programs periodically as needed. Maintenance is performed as needed and documented in our files.  In order to evaluate potential accidental releases, we performed an off-site consequence analysis using guidance from  The Fertilizer Institute.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.20 miles.\n\nb.  The alternate release scenario: a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow valve or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (poi"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admiinistration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6 (200) - Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3, (b).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as requirred under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
