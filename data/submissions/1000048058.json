The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\nTraining\r\nCentral Valley Meats has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nCentral Valley Meats carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner..\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nCentral Valley Meats conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nCentral Valley Meats promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation"

This facility slaughters, processes, packs and stores meat consistent with SIC Code 2011. We have two refrigeration systems meet ot exceed applicable Building and Fire Codes including water filled diffusion tanks and on-site ponding basins for any run-off. \r\n\r\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations we used are outlined by the following major steps:\r\n1.\tIdentify Covered Processes\r\n2.\tDetermine Program Level\r\n3.\tEstablish a Management System\r\n4.\tConduct a 5 year Accident History\r\n5.\tPerform Hazard Assessments\r\n6.\tDevelop an Accident Prevention Program\r\n7.\tDevelop an Emergency Response Program and\r\n8.\tPrepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\r\n\r\nOur RMP/PSM has 19 Sections that correspond to RMP/PSM regulatory sections. Publication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). These sections include Overview, Registration, Management System, Accident History, Hazard Assesment, Emergency Response/Actions, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits and Trade Secrets.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Central Valley Meats are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent"

We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for a refrigerant in 2 separate closed loop systems.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \u00bfdialogue\u00bf. According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \u00bfThe worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\u00bf\r\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA\u00bfs RMPComp  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA\u00bfs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest of 2 independent systems.  This release scenario is impossible to accomplish. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by the enclosure in direct contact with outside air.  At Class F atmospheric stability, rural location and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Population estimates for the entire radius is calculated"

Actual number that could be affected by the plume area is only 10% of this.\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from either systems ammonia refrigeration system compressor.  The scenario involves the release of 300.00 lb. of .  Toxic ammonia vapor.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles. Actual distances less than .1 mile are recorded as .1 miles. Several public receptors could be impacted if the wind direction was due north. Two small commercial businesses could be impacted. Typically no more than 5 public receptors are in the businesses.\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCentral Valley Meats maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on4/15/08. All possible conditions that could upset the system and natu"

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\r\nCentral Valley Meats has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no reportable accidental release during this period.\r\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nCentral Valley Meats carries a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Central Valley Meat employees will take defensive actions that do not require entering a hazardous area. The plan includes all aspects of emergency actions including mitigation, monitoring NH3 levels, adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, shelter-in-place notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\nKings County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. \r\nSeveral areas are being evaluated for implementation and staff and removal of insulation that is going bad."
