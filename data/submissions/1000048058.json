The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass meat slaughtering, packing and storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for a refrigerant in 2 separate closed loop systems.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote ?dialogue?. According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration ?The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.?\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA?s RMPComp  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest of 2 independent systems.  This release scenario is impossible to accomplish. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by the enclosure in direct contact with outside air.  At Class F atmospheric stability, rural location and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Population estimates for the entire radius is calculated "

Actual number that could be affected by the plume area is only 10% of this.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from either systems ammonia refrigeration system compressor.  The scenario involves the release of 300.00 lb. of .  Toxic ammonia vapor.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles. Actual distances less than .1 mile are recorded as .1 miles. Several public receptors could be impacted if the wind direction was due north. Two small commercial businesses could be impacted. Typically no more than 5 public receptors are in the businesses.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nCentral Valley Meats maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on4/15/08. All possible conditions that could upset the system and natu"

Five-year Accident History\n\nCentral Valley Meats has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no reportable accidental release during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nCentral Valley Meats carries a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Central Valley Meat employees will take defensive actions that do not require entering a hazardous area. The plan includes all aspects of emergency actions including mitigation, monitoring NH3 levels, adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, shelter-in-place notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nKings County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.
