      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn this facility, we use anhydrous ammonia which is reported as a level 3 material.  This material is used as a refrigerant to provide cooling for the processing areas and for humidity control.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions in handling the substance and to prevent unnecessary human exposure to all site employees, contractors, visitors as well as our community residents.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on IIAR's \"Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The plan has been provided and reviewed with the Kent County Local Emergency Planning Center.  Coordinatioin with the LEPC has been made to notify them through the emergency reponse plan to rrspond to incidents that have the potential to affect the public.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThorn Apple Valley's Grand Rapids Division is in the business of processing and packaging raw meats into edible consumer products.  Our processing, storage, and shipping areas are under stringent USDA guidelines which require absolute control and maintenance of all refrigeration systems in order to maintain sanitary products and production facilities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the refrigerant used and enclosed within a closed-loop system that removes heat from the products and interior areas at low temperatures and pressures and then dispenses the heat at high pressures and temperatures to the outside air.  The ammonia system contains 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards  /  Consequence of Failure to Control Hazards\n\nHealth Hazards :  Ammonia is a colorless gas with extremely pungent odor.  Liquid ammonia vaporizes into a poisonous gas cloud.  Ammonia is a severe irritant to the eyes.  It penetrates the eyes more readily than any other alkali.  Contact wit"

      "SummaryText": "h the liquid form and concentrated solutions can produce severe eye injury or blindness. Laceration or watering of the eyes can occur upon exposure of 150 ppm ammonia gas.\n\nAmmonia is an irritant by inhalation.  At increasing concentration it can cause symptoms ranging from runny nose, coughing, chest pain, trouble breathing, and death.  Inhalation of concentrations of 2500 to 6500 ppm causes shortness of breath, bronchosppasm, chest pain, and pulmonary edema that may be fatal.\n\nExposure of the skin to liquid anhydrous ammonia or high concentrations of the gas can cause first and second degree burns of the skin.  Vapor concentrations fo 10,000 ppm are mildly irritating to moist skin, while 30,000 ppm or greater causes a stinging sensation and can produce burns and blisters.  These high concentrations of ammonia are corrosive to moist skin and other moist body tissue.\n\nPhysical Hazards:  Ammonia or ammonia with oil or other debris is an explosive hazard when exposed to flame or fire.  The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is 16% and the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) is 25% by volume in air.  Elevated temperatures can cause containers of the substance to explode.  Ammonia emits toxic fumes when exposed to heat.  When heated above 850 degress (F), ammonia will emit5 hydrogen gas.  The autoignition temperature is 1204 degrees (F) if catalyzed by iron.\n\nAmmonia can react to form violent or explosive reactions with halogens (e.g., chlorine, bromine).  It can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with strong oxidizers such as hypochlorite bleaches, silver compounds, mercury compounds, gold, and other metals and acids.\n\nExposure Control Methods:\n   * Process enclosure\n   * Local exhaust ventilation\n   * General dilution ventilation\n   * Personal protective equipment\n   * Use of water\n   * Area monitoring (sensors/alarms)\n\nPotential for Exposure to Ammonia\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed-loop system with no purposeful exposure to ammonia.

      "SummaryText": " exposure potentials are primarily related to equipment failure, fugitive emissions from improperly adjusted or worn valve packings, pump and compressor seals and gasket failures, or mistakes in the operations of the system.\n\nWorst Case Scenario :  Toxic Substance\n\nThe worst case scenario at this site is the release 18,000 pounds of ammonia  in a 10 minute period from the system's largest vessel, the high pressure receiver.  The toxic endpoint was determined by using the Cameo/Marplot/Aloha computer-modeling program.  With a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and a stability class \"F\" in an urban topography, the endpoint of the spill was determined to be 1.2 miles from the receiver.  Our facility is located in an industrial park but other public receptors such as schools, residents, and a prison are within the endpoint radius.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario :  Toxic Substance\n\nThe maintenance and operations groups considered the below as probable causes for this scenario:\n\n   * Transfer hose rupture\n   * Process piping failure\n   * Process vessel or pump releases from seals, drains, bleeds\n   * Rupture of sight glass\n   * Overpressure and release through relief valves\n\nThe decision was made that a process piping failure may be most likely to result in a loss of containment.\nThe pipe rupture would result in a one inch by 1/4 inch opening.  At the systems pressures, it was determined the release rate of 159 pounds / minute would be released for 16 minutes for a total release of 2400 pounds.  Wind speeds of 3 meters / second from the Southwest with a stability class \"D\" in an urban setting would result in an endpoint of 0.28 miles and extend beyond the facility's boundaries into public receptors.  The toxic endpoint was computed by Cameo/Marplot/Aloha modeling program.\n\nMapping of both scenarios were generated for site and other interested parties.\n\nThe Five Year History\n\nThere were no incidents to report.\n\nRelease Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nManagement syste"
