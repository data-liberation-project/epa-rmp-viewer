The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 34.924896, -120.398101. The facility is located approximately 1 mile east of state highway 101 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nCentral City Cooling is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed the following faults within close proximity:\n\nSanta Maria Fault - <1.6 Million Years\n\nBradley Canyon Fault - <1.6 Million Years\n\nSan Luis Range Fault System - <130,000 Years\n\nWest Huasna Fault Zone - <130,000 Years\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Central City Cooling has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators, accumulators, and recirculators"

Under normal conditions, the high pressure receiver contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSurge Drum\n\nThe purpose of each surge drum is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the vacuum tube coils.

Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nPlate and Frame Heat Exchanger\n\nThe purpose of the plate and frame heat exchanger is to remove heat from the water being pumped through it. The plate and frame heat exchanger receives liquid from the high temperature recirculator where it flows through the channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the water on the opposite side of each plate. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the plate and frame heat exchanger and is returned to the recirculator. Under normal conditions, the plate and frame heat exchanger contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.  \n\n\n\nIce Makers\n\nThe purpose of the ice makers is to produce ice that can be used for packaging finished products. The ice maker receives liquid from the low temperature recirculator. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the ice maker and is returned to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the ice maker contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nModular Automated Cooling System (MACs) Coolers\n\nThe purpose of the MAC cooler is to remove heat from the fresh fruit that is placed within the MAC cooler chamber. The MAC cooler receives liquid from the high temperature liquid recirculator. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the MAC cooler and is returned to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the MAC cooler contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nVacuum Tube Chillers\n\nThe purpose of the vacuum tube chiller is to remove heat from the leafy green vegetables that are placed within the vacuum tube chamber.

Under normal conditions, the vacuum tube chiller contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nMedium Suction Accumulator\n\nThe purpose of the medium suction accumulator is to subcool the high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver. This subcooled liquid is sent to the high temperature recirculator and vacuum tube chillers. In addition, it prevents liquid from entering the compressors. The medium suction accumulator receives vapor from the surge drums and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. The medium suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the medium suction accumulator or recirculator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the c"

Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAuto-Purger\n\nThe purpose of the auto-purger is to remove non-condensable gases from the system without requiring the system to be manually opened. The auto-purger consists of the following components: water bubbler, foul gas line, liquid line, suction line, water line, drain line, and remote purge point solenoid valves. The auto-purger removes non-condensable gases by refrigerating the foul gas so that the ammonia vapor condenses to liquid and can be returned to the system. The non-condensable gases are removed from the system through the water bubbler. Under normal conditions, the auto-purger contains small quantities of ammonia and water. \n\n\n\n1.2.5 Safety Systems\n\n\n\nAmmonia Detection System\n\nThe detection system is interlocked with the refrigeration system controls as follows:\n\nTwo (2) ammonia detectors are installed within the machinery room;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm, visual alarms will be initiated outside the machinery room; in addition, exhaust fan 1 will be activated;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 125 ppm, exhaust fan 2 will be activated;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 150 ppm, audible alarms will be initiated outside the machinery room;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 5,000 ppm, the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room will be de-energized;\n\nAn ammonia detector is installed in each refrigerated docks/rooms;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm, visual alarms will be initiated;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 35 ppm, audible alarms will be initiated;\n\nAt each level, the ammonia detection system is interlocked with an automatic dialing system which sends an email and text messages out to facility management.

The EPCS consists of a crossover solenoid valve which connects the high stage discharge (HSD) pipe to the high temperature suction (HTS) pipe. The EPCS operates as follows: \n\nEPCS is activated at not greater than 90% pressure relief valve setting (e.g. 270 psig or less) [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.3] \n\nUpon activation, all compressors are stopped by a means that is independent of all other safety controls [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n\nUpon activation, crossover solenoid valve is opened [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n\nUpon activation, a signal is provided to personnel responsible for refrigeration system maintenance [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.7] \n\nEPCS remains active until manually reset [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.8]\n\nEPCS crossover isolation valves are locked open [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.4.2] \n\n\n\nRelief Valves\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing.

The relief valve discharge piping is terminated at the bottom of the ammonia diffusion tank. The ammonia diffusion tank is 8' dia. x 16' high (6,000 gallon capacity). A"
