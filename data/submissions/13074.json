(Tosco) to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above a threshold quantity (TQ) this applies to the Santa Maria Facility.  The Santa Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  The Facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\nThe Santa Maria Facility processes oil into intermediate products for further processing at other locations to produce gasoline.  The Facility receives oil from many sources via pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, and truck.  The Refining process separates the crude oil into four products: gas oil, naphtha (pressure distillate), sulfur, and coke (solid carbon based material).  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce gasoline.  The gas oil and naphtha products are also stored in the Facility's Storage Tanks prior to shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and solid coke are shipped offsite by truck or railcar.  The Facility also has the utility and support systems required to provide for safe operation of the plant, including a power generation Facility to make use of gas generated in the Refining Process.\n\nThe RMP consists of three parts required for submittal:\n7 RMP Executive Summary\n7 Hazard Assessment\n7 RMP Data Elements\n\nThe RMP effort at"
