The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel will coordinate with local emergency response agencies and first responders to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n2.0 Description of The Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. These substances are:\n\nRegulated Substances: \tChlorine: Stored in 90-ton rail cars and bulk storage tanks.\n\t\t\tAnhydrous Ammonia: Stored in bulk storage tanks.\n\t\nProcess Description: Part of the treatment process at the Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant includes the use of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia to form chloramines. When compared to chlorine disinfection, chloramination can provide better protection against certain bacterial regrowth due to greater residual stability than free chlorine alone. \n\n3.0  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\nIn order to aid the RMP Team in accident prevention planning, we have conducted a conservative analysis of accidental release scenarios including modeling, population surveys and environmental assessment of poten"

An alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia were a release from a transfer hose failure.  By evaluating and modeling the potential consequences of these scenarios, we are better able to focus our efforts regarding emergency prevention and response specific to each chemical\u0092s hazard.\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia from our process. The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. It is important to understand that the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small. The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes. By identifying these potential releases, the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant Ch"

The following details the prevention program elements at The Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\u009b physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n\u009b chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n\u009b operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n\u009b design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n\u009b specific chemical inventories.\n\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  \nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). \nThis information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and other chemicals used in our process.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\n\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design, construction, and operating parameters of process equipment.  This information includes:\n\u009b materials of construction,\n\u009b design pressures,\n\u009b temperature ratings,\n\u009b electrical ratings,\n\u009b flow limits,\n\u009b block flow diagrams,\n\u009b consequences of deviation from operating limits,\n\u009b safety systems,\n\u009b applicable design codes and standar"

Within this program, the Chlorination & Ammoniation Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHRs, Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHRs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination/Ammoniation Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination and Ammoniation Processes are no longer in operation.  The resul"
