These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.  Response activities are coordinated with the local fire department to ensure the appropriate level of response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHexion completes a thorough review of the vinyl acetate system each time a design change is implemented.

The following is a description of the various resins produced on a batch basis, based on the customer demand.  The main product is resin, including alkyds, polyesters, and latex emulsions.  The resins are produced via high temperature (i.e. 380- 500 F) polymerization of vegetable oils, organic acids, and polyols in reactors (or kettles).  The reaction products are then diluted using various solvents in mix tanks and shipped to customers in drums, 2,500 pound modular containers or by bulk in tank trucks.  Products are occasionally used in-house as bases.\n\nBases are used for production of certain modified synthetic coatings (copolymers, polyurethanes, and silicones) which are then shipped out to customers via the same three methods mentioned above.  All processes are conducted in a batch mode.  Support operations include storage tanks, and analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical, vinyl acetate, is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP.  Vinyl acetate is a raw material (monomer) used for latex emulsions.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc. (Hexion) Carpentersville, Il facility management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Hexion employees, the public and the environment. \n \nThis objective will be accomplished by utilizing good general operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coor"

Further, Hexion recognizes that it has a duty to protect its employees and neighbors from the effects of all dangerous chemicals.\n\nWhile chemicals are a fundamental component of the coatings that Hexion manufactures, each chemical is given due consideration with regard to techniques for safe handling and processing.  Therefore, even though a particular compound may not be listed within the regulations, it is handled according to any hazardous properties that it possesses.\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Release\n\nAfter review of the information gathered for the potential worst case and alternate case release scenarios, combined with local geographic information, it was determined that no release of VAM would have offsite consequences to the adjacent properties to the west and south.  However, a release of VAM within the RMP Toxic Endpoint distance to the western fence line could have potential off site consequences.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Carpentersville facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended  to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment. \nThese regulations include:\n40CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n40CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n40CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n29CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in Hexion's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encou"
