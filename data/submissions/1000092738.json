Our facility has one 30,000 gallon tank, equipment for receving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet or exceed all local, state and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\n\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n\n\n1.  Excess flow falves to prevent from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n\n2.  Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n\n3.  Inspections by insurance loss control specialists to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\n\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Spearman fire department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency."
