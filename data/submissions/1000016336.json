We manufacture some of the finest turkey products in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains anhydrous ammonia in a quantity greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\nCooper Farms has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. \n\n\n\nCooper Farms has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library consisting of five numbere"
