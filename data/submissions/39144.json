Anhydrous ammonia is utilized at the Griffith Energy facility in the chiller system. Liquid ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the system that enhances gas turbine performance and efficiency during warm weather conditions by cooling the turbine inlet air. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators and compressors that comprise the chiller system. All equipment used within the chiller system has been designed and constructed under codes and standards regulated by the ammonia industry.\n\nChiller System Prevention ProgramSafety\n\nGriffith Energy maintains compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 CFR 68, CAA Section 112 EPA Risk Management Program.\n\nIn addition to the required OSHA, EPA and corporate safety programs that are mandated within the facility, the following engineering and administrative controls will be in place to eliminate, or reduce the possibility of an accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the Griffith Energy facility:\n\n\u00b7Computer Control System monitors and controls compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps. System displays continual operational status of equipment and controls alarms / shutdowns for out of parameter operation.\n\u00b7\tHigh level alarm and system shut offs are installed on pressure vessels. Abnormal operating levels sensed in the ammonia vessels will activate a shutdown of the chiller system compressors. \n\u00b7\tPressure relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels to eliminate the potential of an over-pressure condition within the vessels and the ammonia chiller system.\n\u00b7\tEmergency stop button ins"

Detection system activates visual alarms at the facility main control center to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak in the chiller system.\n\u00b7\tPreventative maintenance prograsm are established within the maintenance department to ensure all ammonia system components are maintained in optimum operational and mechanical condition.\n\u00b7\tContinual vibration analysis of compressors and condenser fan drive shafts is provided to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure.\n\u00b7\tAmmonia system operators receive system training from outside contractors with extensive knowledge and experience with anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOff Site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by EPA RMP Submit 2004 guidelines, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios involving the accidental release of anhydrous ammoina from this facility have been calculated. The results are retained on file at the Griffith Energy facility.\n\nGriffith Energy has had no accidents associated with anhydrous ammonia use at the facility.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nGriffith Energy's emergency plan is part of the overall facility Integrated Contingency Plan which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. \nProcedures have been developed for: \n1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; \n2) personnel roles and lines of authority; \n3) training; \n4) communication; \n5) emergency recognition and prevention; \n6) safe distances and places of refuge; \n7) site security and control; \n8) emergency alerting and response; \n9) personal protective and emergency equipment; and \n10) medical surveillance. \n\nAll emergency response personnel undergo required training. Records of this training is maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures"
