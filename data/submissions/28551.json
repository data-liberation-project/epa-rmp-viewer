This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in Emergency Action Plan to address releases of chlorine.  If an emergency were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a producer of sodium hypochlorite solution and temporary storer of ton containers of chlorine.  Chlorine is an intermediate product in the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite.  System 1 - Liquid Chlorine has a calculated chlorine quantity on-site of 533 pounds.  System 2 - Chlor-Alkali Plant has a calculated chlorine quantity on-site of 68 pounds.  In System 3 - Ton Container Storage, a maximum of 200,000 pounds of chlorine may be on-site in ton containers.  Thus, the total facility capacity is approximately 200,601 pounds of chlorine.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a chlorine ton container in System 3 when it has its maximum intended inventory of 2,000 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 0.0087 mg/l chlorine toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4 effective diameter orifice leak (representative of releases from piping failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seats and drains or bleeds that lead to an airborne release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 0.2 mile.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies"

Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled Emergency Action Plan and Process Safety Management, Chlorine Systems.   Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Comission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the chlorine systems."
