The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The plan also covers the sequential steps of addressing a potential fire, spill, tornado, and bomb threat.  The program addresses the responsibilities of each member of the emergency response team and outlines the network of communication to ensure success.  When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to gas plant processes.  The overall emergency response program for the Teague Plant is coordinated with the Freestone Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with the LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Teague Plant resolves all findings from hazard analyses, some of which may result in modification to the process.  At the current time, any possible recommendations from hazard analyses will be completed prior to startup of the plant."

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral test, skills determination) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Teague Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner"

Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n\r\nThe Teague Plant uses a locked gate to control the entry and exit of XTO and contractor personnel.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation  \r\n\r\nThe Teague Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a company engineer with maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise of this type of facility.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the engineer.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.

Trend Gathering and Treating, LLC demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Teague Plant, located near Teague, TX, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at Teague.  Produced gas and liquids enter the plant at an approximate rate of 330MMCFD. The gas will flow through an MDEA (Methyl Diethanolamine) amine unit that will remove the CO2 and H2S. Rich amine will be flashed and the flash gas will be sent to the plants onsite fuel manifold and will be used as fuel for various fired processes in the plant. The rich amine liquid will flow to the amine regeneration unit (reboiler) where the CO2 and H2S will be driven off with heat. The lean amine will return to the amine unit and the overhead H2S and CO2 gas stream from the reboiler will go to the caustic contact tower where a caustic solution (typically sodium hydroxide) will absorb the H2S and flow to the sites closed loop H2S biological treatment unit (Paques Plant). The H2S in the caustic stream will be aerobically reduced with specialized bacteria and the lean caustic will return to the caustic contact tower. The CO2 will be vented. \r\n\r\nTrace amounts of H2S will be emitted from the Paques plant and spent biomass and"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.30 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a BLEVE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.30 miles.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Teague Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release and to reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\n       Release Containment Control\r\n\r\n       1) Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n       2)  Automated bypasses and manual shutoffs for specific process parameters\r\n       3)  Pressure relief valves will be properly sized and testes every 3 years.  Any such valve that fails a test will be replaced or   \r\n       Repaired and tested annually until engineering is satisfied that it's reliable.\r\n       4)  Baseline ultrasonic testing thickness testing (for pipe corrosion) will be performed prior to startup and every 3 years\r\n       Thereafter.\r\n\r\n       Release Mitigation\r\n\r\n       1)  Local fire department has been notified abo"
