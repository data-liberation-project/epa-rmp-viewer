      "SummaryText": "The primary business of this facility is the treatment of wastewater for a connected population of approximately 130,000.  The activity requires the use of chlorine gas as a disinfection agent and the use of sulfur dioxide gas as a dechlorination agent.  Both gases in the form of liquid uder pressure are delivered to the facility via truck.  The gases are stored in an isolated haves of the gas storage buildingin one ton steel cylinders.  The maximum amount of chlorine tons stored on site is 15.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide tons stored on site is 4.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases are distributed from the ton cylinders by piping through vacuum regulation systems to separate chloinator and sulfurnator rooms.  Chlorine gas is water injucted under vacuum to create a solution, which can be fed to various points in the treatment system.  Sulfur dioxide is fed in similar manner but only to a point following the chlorine disinfection point.\n\nAccidental release and emergency policies:  It is the general policy of the City of Wyoming Clean Water Plant to take all precautions and preventative measures necessary to ensure against unplanned releases of any hazardous substances that might prove harmful.  There are numerous structural and administrative safeguards in place which are intended to prevent hazardous materials release.  Structural elements and mechanical systems are subject to rigorous inspection and preventative maintenance programs to insure proper operating capabilities.  Plant personnel receive extensive training unique to the Clean water plant.  In addition policies and guidelines specific to wastewater treatment.  These safety procedures have been developed with regard to state and federal regulations.\n\nMeasures for Preventing accidental releases of hazardous materials:  The City of wyoming Clean Water Plant is subject to two major regulatory programs which address the prevention of accidents and injuries from hazardous chemical releases.

The second of these programs is the Hazardous Waste Operations and Occupational Health Rules 325.52101-52137.  The Hazwoper program requires development of a detailed plan outliningall steps which have been taken and those that will be taken in the event of a hazadous materials release.  We also have developed an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\nEmergency response Preparations:  Because of the quantitiy of chlorine handled by this facility, it is subject to regulation under  Emergency Preparedness-Community Right to Know Act.  This regualtion requires that the facility working in cooperation with the local government agencies and officals, must establish a formal plan for responding to chemical emergency incidents.  Our facility hasan established plan dated 2004.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:  In the five years preceeding this document there have been no releases of hazardous material.\n\nProjected Safety Enhancements:  Proposed exercises with the City of Wyoming hazmat team."
