All applicable procedures of the Cal/ARP Program are adhered to. The Dune Company of Blythe emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nDune Company of Blythe stores dry fertilizer and pesticides and stores and blends liquid fertilizer for sale and application to farmland. The facility stores the following quantities of regulated substances:\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous Ammonia - 219,140 pounds\n\u00bf\tAqueous Ammonia - 20,300 pounds\n\u00bf\tAldicarb (Thimet 15G) - 250 pounds\n\u00bf\tAzinphos-methyl (Guthion 2L) - 40 pounds\n\u00bf\tCarbofuran (Furadan 4F) - 493 pounds\n\u00bf\tDimethoate (Dimethoate E267) - 506 pounds\n\u00bf\tEndosulfan (Endosulfan 3EC, Endosulfan 50WSB, and Thiodan 3EC) - 1,150 pounds\n\u00bf\tMethamidophos (Monitor 4) - 714 pounds\n\u00bf\tMethomyl (Lannate SP and Lannate LV) - 521 pounds\n\u00bf\tOxamyl (Vydate LV) - 260 pounds\n\u00bf\tPhorate (Thimet 20G) - 3,408 pounds\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia; 0.14 mg/L for aqueous ammonia; 0.0003 mg/L for aldicarb; 0.001 mg/L for azinphos-methyl; 0.00043 for carbofuran; 0.03 mg/L for dimethoate; 0.0008 mg/L for endosulfan; 0.0075 mg/L for methamidophos; 0.01 mg/L methomyl; 0.0017 mg/L for oxamyl; and 0.0001 mg/L for phorate).

      "SummaryText": "toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for the process, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario.\"  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at Dune Company of Blythe involves the release of all anhydrous ammonia containing product. Because the anhydrous ammonia storage is in proximity of each other, the total amount of anhydrous ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 219,140 pounds (lbs). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the following set of conditions.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenarios were performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 4.2 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected of 7,400 persons were obtained for the release scenario. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involved the release of each toxic substance stored at the facility. The amount of aldicarb released was predicted to be 250 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles. The amount of anhydrous ammonia released was predicted to be 219,120 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 2.2 miles. The amount of aqueous ammonia released was predicted to be 20,300 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.56 miles. The amount of azinphos-methyl released was predicted to be 40 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of carbofuran released was predicted to be 493 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of dimethoate released was predicted to be 506 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of endosulfan released was predicted to be 1,150 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of methamidophos released was predicted to be 714 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.23 miles. The amount of methomyl rele"

The amount of oxamyl released was predicted to be 260 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.38 miles. The amount of phorate released was predicted to be 3,408 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles. The toxic concentration levels outside these endpoint distances are below the allowable standards for toxic substances established by AIHA. The typical meteorological conditions used for these scenarios was a Stability Class D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature, and average humidity.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00bf\tHigh level of training of the operators.\n\u00bf\tPreventative maintenance programs.\n\u00bf\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\u00bf\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\u00bf\tPerformance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n\u00bf\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases at Dune Company of Blythe in the past five years.\n\nDune Company of Blythe will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation."
