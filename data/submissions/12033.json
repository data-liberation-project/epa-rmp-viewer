ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED,STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR BOTH DIRECT APPLICATION AND FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.  THE MAXIMIUM QUANITY STORED WOULD BE 260,000 POUNDS IN ALL OUR TANKS.\n\n3.

THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANACE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .84 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON A 2 MINUTE RELEASE ON A 3 INCH PIPE LEAK. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4.THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEA"
