Energy Transfer\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, and emergency planning and response activities in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\nNon-Responding Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nEnergy Transfer owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Garden City, Texas.  The St. Lawrence Gas Plant compresses and treats natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas and NGL exit the plant via product pipelines. \nPre-treated, sweet field gas enters the plant via a pipeline, is dehydrated, and sent to the NGL recovery plant.  At the recovery plant, gas is routed to a demethanizer tower, which separates it into a residue gas product stream and an NGL product stream.  The NGL stream is purified using an amine treater, which removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.  St. Lawrence Gas Plant uses a flare to burn gases during emergency/upset conditions, system maintenance, and startup and shutdown.  The flare is also used to burn waste acid gas generated by the amine treatment system.  NGL is then pumped i"

Residue gas is also transported off-site via the sales pipeline. \nThe RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are the flammable mixture comprised of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane, which is being processed through the plant; as well as propane, which is used as refrigerant in the cryogenic process. There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \nEnergy Transfer has determined that the gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  This facility has one process (as defined by the regulation) consisting of a flammable mixture and propane.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems are to be considered one process (see definition of process at 40 CFR 68.3). \nEnergy Transfer has determined that St. Lawrence Gas Plant is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility operator training, and intervention.\nPrevention Program\nThe St. Lawrence Gas Plant is operating under"

A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include: \n-\tProviding overpressure relief valves on pressurized vessels.\n-\tProviding level transmitters and alarms on vessels to help prevent overfilling.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare.\n-\tProviding automated and manual valves to isolate portions of the process.\n-\tInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of possible explosive environment.\n-\tInstalling fire eye detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of a possible fire.\n-\tInstalling security lighting to facilitate observation of the entire facility.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility 24/7/365.\n-\tProviding an evacuation alarm system to safely evacuate personnel from the facility.\n-\tConducting periodic operational rounds to ensure problems are detected and corrected in a timely manner.\n\tFive-Year Accident History\n\tThe facility has not experienced an incident during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.  There have been no releases of RMP-regulated substances that have resulted in onsite injuries, deaths, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\tEmergency Response Program\n\tThe facility will conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Glasscock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Glasscock County Volunteer Fire Department.

Some of the key components of the safety program are: \n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, or equipment are considered.\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) review serves as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential process hazards and verification of safeguards, thereby leading to continual improvements in process safety and safe work practices.\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity program ensures that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n-\tIncident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective and/or preventative measures are taken as applicable following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work practices are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of an incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion.\n-\tAn annual dialogue with the Glasscock County LEPC and the Glasscock County Volunteer Fire Department will ensure a readiness to respond to potential emergencies, as well to implement improvem"
