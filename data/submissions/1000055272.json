This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Devon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe compression facility on the State Flying Buffalo property is located approximately twenty-four (24) miles south of Gillette, WY. At this facility purchased pipeline gas is compressed, dehydrated, mixed with purchased Y-Grade natural gas liquids, and carried by flowlines to nearby wells.\n\nMost liquid drains are sent to the produced water tanks at the nearest production facility (State Flying Buffalo 1PH, located on the same pad as the State Flying Buffalo Compression Facility), where produced water is off-loaded by truck for disposal. The hydrocarbon liquid drains are sent to the produced oil tanks at the nearest production facility, where oil is off-loaded by truck for sale. Purchased Y-Grade natural gas liquid is loaded by truck to on-site storage tanks. Purchased natural gas is delivered by the gathering system operated by Meritage Midstream. In the event of a pipeline outage or upset, the injection facility will be shut down.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains three sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; station gas consisting of mostly methane, natural gas liquids, and co"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the State Flying Buffalo Compression Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe State Flying Buffalo Compression Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere to prevent vessels from rupturing\n\n2.    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n3.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n3.    SPCC Plan\n\n4.    Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe State Flying Buffalo Compression Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safe"

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  . Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the State Flying Buffalo Compression Facility is coordinated with the Campbell County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Charles Messenheimer is the contact for the LEPC (307-686-7477).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The State Flying Buffalo Compression Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  Devon operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Devon conducts periodic emergency drills that involv"
