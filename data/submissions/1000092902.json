Liquid and vapor returned from the chillers is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator or supplied directly to the compressors. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nPlate and Frame Heat Exchanger\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the plate and frame heat exchanger is to remove heat from the glycol solution being pumped through it.

The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulators. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessels reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessels to become subject to high pressure and activating the transfer pumps which moves the liquid to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels and transfer pumps can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the chillers to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulators or chillers and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers.

      "SummaryText": "ct resulting from this reaction is a dilute solution of ammonium sulfate at a pH range between 5 and 9. \n\n\n\nThe pH scale is a series of numbers (0-14) expressing the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution, as compared to some reference solution. The inventor of the term pH was named Sorensen and he defined it as:\n\n\n\npH = -log [H+] (negative log of hydrogen ion concentration)\n\n\n\nA solution is neutral when all of the hydrogen ions are matched with hydroxide ions. At 25?C a neutral solution has a pH of 7.0. Ammonium sulfate solutions in the pH range between 5 and 9 are typically classified as neutral or weakly alkaline/acidic.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nRelief Valves\n\n\n\nFour (4) Squibb Taylor pressure relief valves are installed on the ammonia storage tank. The relief valves on the vessel relieve at 265 psig and discharge to the atmosphere. Refer to the Relief System Design and Design Basis documentation for more information.\n\n\n\nA relief valve is installed on the Neutralization Tank piping to allow for the relief of overpressure due to ammonia expansion resulting from high heat. The relief valve discharges into the Neutralization Sample Tank which is filled with water.\n\n\n\nAnalog Gauge\n\n\n\nAn analog gauge is installed on the ammonia storage tank. The gauge provides the ability for operators to monitor vessel fill percentage.\n\n\n\nExcess Flow Valves\n\n\n\nExcess flow valves are safety devices which are designed to close in the event of a piping failure to prevent flow. Excess flow valves are located on the liquid and vapor piping, close to the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Tank.\n\n\n\nEmergency Shutoff Valves\n\n\n\nThe emergency shutoff valves are connected to a pull station and controlled pneumatically. The operator can isolate the tank by activating any of the five (5) pull stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Process Classification\n\n\n\n1.2.4.1 Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nRefrigeration\n\n\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Mission Bell Winery consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnec"

As such, the refrigeration systems at Mission Bell Winery are treated as independent processes.\n\n\n\nIon Exchange & Vacuum Pan Neutralization\n\n\n\nThe Ion Exchange & Vacuum Pan Neutralization system at Mission Bell Winery consists of a vessel, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the Ion Exchange & Vacuum Pan Neutralization system at Mission Bell Winery is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of process hazards in annual safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nMission Bell Winery has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the covered processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe covered processes at the Mission Bell Winery facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 118,546 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the covered processes and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 "

Nevertheless, Mission Bell Winery continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Mission Bell Winery's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Mission Bell Winery's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nMission Bell Winery has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Mission Bell Winery has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Mission Bell Winery now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Mission Bell Winery employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Mission Bell Winery will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. "
