The Ammonia Refrigeration System consists of a main ammonia receiver tank, eight shell and tube heat exchangers, twenty-five evaporators, an ammonia vapor accumulator, eight compressors and three evaporative condensers.\n\n We only have one (1) regulated substance [Ammon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
