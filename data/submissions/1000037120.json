      "SummaryText": "Preferred Freezer has created and implemented a process safety management / risk management plan PSM / RMP for their Facility located at 7080 Express Lane, Houston, TX 77078 (Facility). This PSM / RMP document was designed in accordance with OSHA's PSM Program (29 CFR 1910.119) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) because the Site handles a chemical (anhydrous ammonia) listed in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nUSPEA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, which is Authorized under 112 (R) of the Clean Air  Act (CAA), requires that facilities that have covered processes establish RMPs to reduce the risk of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident. This RMP Executive Summary summarizes the efforts that Preferred Freezer has undertaken to establish a RMP in conjunction with the PSM program.\n\n\n\nThe on-site maximum intended storage quantity of the liquid anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 18,439 lbs. In addition, anhydrous ammonia is regulated by both the PSM and the RMP.  The Facility does not use any other chemicals or flammable materials in excess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements. A management system is considered one of the most important elements of this Facility's RMP, as its goal is to ensure that lines of authority and responsibility are clearly defined, helping to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented. The person who has overall responsibility for the RMP at the Facility is the General Manager.\n\n\n\nThe Facility uses anhydrous ammonia within one closed loop refrigeration system consisting of vessels, compressors, evaporative condensers, and associated piping and valves. The primary business of Preferred Freezer facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products. The refrigeration system cycles ammonia through vari"

The Facility utilizes ammonia sensors placed in strategic locations in the freezer, dock, and Engine Room. In the event of ammonia detection, an alarm is triggered on the control system and at the Facility, and the ammonia refrigeration technicians are subsequently notified. These detectors are also programmed to alarm to the control system. In addition, Preferred Freezer personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. If a leak is detected or observed by any Preferred Freezer employee (or contractor), it is immediately reported to their supervisor. Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume. If offsite, operators will return to the facility to investigate the situation, at which time a determination as to the appropriate response will be made.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits. Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will alarm at when a designated concentration of ammonia is detected. When the detectors alarm, they terminate the supply of ammonia to the area of the warehouse in which the detection occurred. This prevents the quantity released from escala"

The purpose is to verify that critical process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained properly, and operated correctly. In accordance with this program, the ammonia processes and equipment must be constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of the highly hazardous chemicals. The mechanical integrity program at the Facility includes the following: identifying and categorizing equipment, inspecting and testing of instrumentation and documenting maintenance procedures, training of maintenance personnel, establishing criteria for acceptable test results, documenting test and inspection results, and, documenting manufacturer information for equipment and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nThe Facility performs a system integrity check every five years for the ammonia refrigeration systems. The equipment is maintained in accordance with manufacturer specifications, and applicable standards and codes. The facility utilizes guidance from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Bulletin 110.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations at the time of construction including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, Electrical Code, and the Uniform Fire Code. In addition, the systems are designed in accordance with ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards applicable at the time. ASHRAE publishes a safety code for mechanical refrigeration that outlines requirements for occupancy classification, refrigerating systems classification, refrigerant classification, and refrigerant use, design and construction of equipment systems, pressure limiting devices, pressure relief protection, installation, and field pressure tests.\n\n\n\nAll new employees, r"

All persons hired who are responsible for operations of the ammonia system are given on the job training before they are allowed to work on operate or otherwise manipulate or affect the ammonia system. The demonstration and on the job training includes detailed instruction on the ammonia system, including the following: the physical aspects of ammonia, operating the ammonia system, and casualties involving the ammonia system. They are trained regarding the hazards and safety precautions to be observed for the ammonia system. In addition, annual refresher training is required. \n\n\n\nThe Facility has a current Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan. All employees have been trained in the plan, and the plan is reviewed frequently to verify that it is current with plant operating practice. The plan contains emergency response procedures which include actions for evaluating the severity and controlling releases of hazardous materials including ammonia. A list of the agencies that must be notified is included in the plan to assure that the public is properly notified in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat (cannot respond to ammonia concentrations exceeding 300 ppm), the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, and RMP regulations. Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuation procedures.\n\nPreferred Freezer has performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) that evaluated all potential hazards for the facility on December 12 through 13, 2012.

Each identified consequence was assigned a relative risk raking based on the severity of the consequence and anticipated frequency. The team then discussed corrective actions, which were recorded and implemented or are in the process of being implemented. Preferred Freezer has implemented these various analysis and training programs to prevent and prepare for an emergency release.\n\n\n\nTo date, the Facility's Five Year History (and the entire history of the plant) does not include any accidental releases from the ammonia system which resulted in a reportable quantity of ammonia released to the atmosphere.\n\n"
