The facility receives liquid petroleum gases (LPGs) by pipeline and trucks, processes the gases, stores gas products in 60,000 gal bullet tanks, and delivers LPGs into the Mariner East II (MEII), Mariner West (MW) and Rover pipelines.\r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Revolution Plant:\r\n\r\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. ET is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Revolution Gas Plant , as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. ET, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Slovan-Smith Township Volunteer Fire Department and the Washington County Department of Public Safety.\r\n\r\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Revolution Plant is to act as cryogenic gas processing plant.  Due to the flammable effects associated with the LPGs, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  ET's Revolution Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which LPGs are handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and proce"

Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. \r\n\r\nFor planning purposes, ET has considered the impact of worst case and alternative release scenarios.  The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. the worst case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  Consideration of the release scenarios has been incorporated into ET's notification and emergency response planning. ET also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment. \r\n\r\nET has not had any RMP covered process accidents in the past five years. ET has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. ET has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. ET provides annual emergency response training to its employees. ET's management is committed to the following:\r\n- Preventing accidents;\r\n- Continuing to proactively seek out improvements to process safety;\r\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\r\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\r\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with ETP operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\r\n- Being a good corporate citizen in Washington County.\r\n\r\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the LPG processing plant. Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors and our community."
