      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nHarcros Chemicals Inc. (Harcros) has a long-standing commitment to safety and protection of the environment.  As members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution and are committed to operating in a safe and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nHarcros acquired this facility and its employees from Lynx Chemical Group in July 2007.  This facility is located on a 27-acre site and primarily manufactures sodium glucoheptonate and blends chemical formulations.\r\n\r\nThe two chemicals covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule 40 CFR 68 are anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia.  A third RMP chemical was discontinued in 2015, which uses phosphorus trichloride, a toxic chemical subject to the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  The documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees.  They address important process parameters such as operating limits for equipment, design basis and configuration of equipment, and physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used.\r\n\r\nChemical information is contained in Safety Data Sheets (SDS's).  Important process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation d"

A hazard and operability study (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  We update and revalidate each hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented, and recommendations are tracked until resolved.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nOur employees develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility.  These procedures cover (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure they are updated following process changes.\r\n\r\nThis plant uses a batch sheet system.  Batch sheets are the detailed operating instructions for making a batch of product.  They include process deviation codes describing the actions to take under various conditions (e.g. high temperature or pressure, loss of cooling).\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nThe Harcros Chemical's Dalton plant trains all workers to safely and efficiently perform their tasks as per our training matrix.  Employees new to a process are provided basic training including (1) overview of process, (2) properties of substances used and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of the process, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nRefresher training intervals are decided, in part, by our employees b"

All training is documented.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\nThe Harcros Chemical's Dalton plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  When a problem is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root causes to help prevent future problems.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards for our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training, and (5) required documentation.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\nHarcros reviews all changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measured are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind, all changes are subject to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators are notified of the change, and (4) training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\r\nFor new processes and if a change requires updating the process safety information, we will perform a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for service before startup.  This review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves as a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nEmployees at the Harcros Chemical's Dalton plant promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resu"
