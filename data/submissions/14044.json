Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia\nrefrigeration system following its RMP Program. The RMP Program\nwas developed in 1991 to comply with New Jersey's Toxic\nCatastrophe Prevention Act. The Standard Operating Procedures,\nPreventative Maintenance Program, Management of Change Program,\nEmergency Response Plan, and other elements of the RMP Program\nhave developed over the years to further improve the safety,\nreliability, and risk reduction of the ammonia refrigeration\nsystem.\n\n                      Johanna Foods, Inc.\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has three production plants on one site.\nThe Juice Plant packages chilled juice products in half gallon,\nquart and pint paper containers that require refrigeration for\nprocessing and storage. The Aseptic Plant packages juice products\nin Brik Pak containers (drink boxes) in a variety of sizes and\nflavors that requires refrigeration for processing but not for\nstorage. The Yogurt Plant packages yogurt products in cup\ncontainers of various sizes, styles, and flavors that require\nrefrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is\nthe regulated chemical that is used as the refrigerant. The\nquantity of anhydrous ammonia contained in the refrigeration\nsystem  on site varies up to 55,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia\nis not consumed or produced by the refrigeration system. The\nrefrigeration system circulates the anhydrous ammonia converting\nit from a liquid to a vapor to create cooling, then condensing\nthe vapor back to a liquid to be used again.\n\n                  Worst-case Release Scenario\n\n     The worst-case release scenario assumed that the largest\nvessel in the refrigeration system, the receiver, was 95% full of\nanhydrous ammonia. This would be a quantity of 38,000 pounds of\nanhydrous"

However, Land View 3 averages the total population of\nthe county area and produces the number of people per square\nmile.

To the south is woods and farmland.\nTo the west is woods and sparse housing. The actual number of\npeople effected would be less than 1419.\n\n                  Alternative Release Scenario\n\n     The alternative release scenario is also the refrigeration\nsystem receiver. The worst-case release scenario assumed the\nreceiver being 95% full. This would be a very abnormal condition\nfor the receiver. The normal operating level of the receiver is\n15% to 25% full. For the alternative release scenario the normal\noperating level of the receiver at 25% full, 10,000 pounds, was\nused with a hole or puncture of three square inches. The release\nrate would be 362 pounds per minute and would last about 30\nminutes. This scenario was also analyzed using RMP*Comp Ver.\n1.06. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L\nreached .2 miles. It was estimated using Land View 3 that this\nwould effect 27 people. However, Land View 3 averages the total\npopulation of the county area and produces the number of people\nper square mile. Johanna Foods, Inc. has large building around\nthe receiver. To the north is wooded area and farmland. To the\neast are car dealerships and businesses. To the south is woods\nand farmland. To the west is woods and sparse housing.
