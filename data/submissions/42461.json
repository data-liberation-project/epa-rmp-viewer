This commitment is supported by our EHS Management System (RC/EHSMS) and annual commitments to improvement objectives for significant EHS aspects of our operation.  The following summarizes the core beliefs and principles which underlies our commitment:\n\n    We will adhere to the Rohm and Haas Company, Environmental, Health and Safety and Sustainable Development (EHS    SD) Principles, applicable Rohm and Haas EHS Standards and the Monomers Business EHS&SD Principles and Policy.  Additionally, we will adhere to the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Guiding Principles and the Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) Technical Specifications.\n    We will operate in compliance with applicable laws, permits and regulation.\n    We will conduct periodic reviews and audits of our RC/EHSMS to ensure conformance with these standards.\n    EHS performance targets and goals will be set on an annual basis and periodically reviewed.\n    The Bayport Management Team is responsible for implementing the RC/EHSMS and providing resources to accomplish its requirements.\n    All employees, contractors and vendors are responsible for improving Environmental, Health and Safety performance in their areas and for conducting their activities in conformance with the RC/EHSMS.\n    All employees will be trained to pr"

E will hold ourselves  and each other accountable.\n\nIn addition we have environmental and safety \"cardinal rules\" that cover proper operation of pollution control equipment, data integrity, reporting of all spills and releases, and change management for all process revisions. \n\nBayport Facility and Chemicals Handled:\n\nThe Bayport plant is a chemical manufacturing facility. Primary products are specialty monomers and biocides. End use applications range from contact lenses and cosmetics to oil field drilling fluids.\n\nWe handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in 165,000 lb. rail cars.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\nOur worst case scenario is a catastophic release of 183,000  lbs of Ethylene Oxide (EO) from a 165,000 lbs rail car which is connected to a weigh tank holding 18,000 lbs of EO.  Using RMP Comp, with a release duration of 10 minutes and a release rate of 18,300 lbs per minute, this release would have a toxic impact of 12 miles.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios:\n\nFor ethylene oxide and propylene oxide the alternative release scenarios are failure of our air pollution control device. With detection (process control instrumentation) and response (shut down of unit operation) neither of  the 3750 lb. releases travel off site, and thus no residences are impacted.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs:\n\nIncluded in the Bayport plant?s accidental release prevention plans are fully automated processes with level and flow measurement and control, minimum inventories of chemicals, excess flow control valves, automatic emergency shut-off valve"

Our emergency plans are reviewed at least annually. Our public notification system consists of calling the LEPC, State of Texas, Harris County, CAER line, and industrial neighbors.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Safety Program\n\nHAZOP's for our various processes are frequently updated."
