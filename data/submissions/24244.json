Roche Colorado Corporation has evaluated the requirements of the RMP rule and has reviewed present emergency management practices.  Roche Colorado Corporation has determined that current practices meet or exceed the requirements of RMP. \n\nRoche Colorado Corporation is a member of the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care? program. Responsible Care? consists of a comprehensive management system designed to address risks associated with the handling of chemicals.  Moreover, Roche Colorado Corporation has an extensive process safety management program designed to satisfy all of Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management program requirements and the RMP.  Roche Colorado Corporation is dedicated to working with the community emergency response authorities to address the potential for releases that could affect the public.  Roche Colorado Corporation employs physical and administrative controls to mitigate potential releases.  Roche Colorado Corporation implements extensive internal training to prevent releases as well as prepare for eventualities which may result from releases.  Roche Colorado Corporation is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and endeavors to prepare the LEPC for the possibility of responding to releases that could originate from Roche Colorado Corporation. \n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation uses piperidine in the production of pharmaceutical intermediates, and in performing research and development of new and/or improved pharmaceutical processes.  Specifically, piperidine is used in the production of anti-HIV/AIDs pharmaceuticals.  Pharmaceuticals are primarily produced vi"

      "SummaryText": "a synthesis routes involving organic chemicals.  Roche Colorado Corporation has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 that exceeds the plan threshold: piperidine.  Piperidine is an organic chemical used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe piperidine threshold for triggering applicability of 40 CFR 68 is 15,000 pounds per process.  The main process vessel containing piperidine has a worst case capacity of 19,000 pounds.\n\nPiperidine has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a large spill.  The worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios are described below per 40 CFR 68.\n\nPiperidine is a chemical with a pungent odor that is readily detectable below concentrations of concern.  The odor is described in literature as amine-like, heavy, sweet, floral, animal odor, odor of pepper.  Due to the odor, exposed persons will not voluntarily stay in areas of even low concentrations.  Little data regarding exposure limits is available in the literature, however Roche Colorado Corporation has been advised by expert toxicologist's to consider the following concentrations for emergency response planning purposes:\n    \n    1 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration for up to one hour without experiencing other than mild, transient adverse health effects or without perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odor. \n\n    10-100 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\n    100-1000 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.\n\nAnticipated health effects are acute irritation/toxici"

      "SummaryText": "ty including skin irritation, corrosive effect on human tissue, nausea.  Below is a description of the release scenarios for piperidine and their off-site consequences:\n\n2.1 WORST-CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\n\nOne worst-case scenario has been developed for Roche Colorado Corporation.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the vessel that can store the largest quantity of piperidine has been identified.  The maximum release of piperidine possible is 19,000 pounds.  Passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  The worst case release would be as a liquid spill to the ground.  Liquid piperidine is then subject to evaporation that may create a vapor cloud that would reach off-site receptors per EPA distance-to-endpoint factors.\n\n2.2 ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a piperidine release from a delivery tank truck.  Tank truck deliveries will be in 2000 gallon increments.  Deliveries will mainly be performed on a concrete containment pad that will contain the entire volume of the tank truck.  The containment pad surface area is approximately 416 square feet.  The concrete pad qualifies as passive control.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention.  The alternative release scenario distance-to-endpoint will reach off-site receptors. \n\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation has been in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program for a number of years.  The EPA has said that a process in compliance with OSHA PSM is also in compliance with RMP program level 3.  The process containing piperidine at Roche Colorado Corporation is RMP program level 3.  All elements of OSHA PSM have been implemented for the piperidine containing process.\n\nKey aspects of the PSM program include: process safety information reviews, process hazard analysis, operating procedure documentation and review, class roo"

Moreover, Roche Colorado Corporation is committed to the protection of both its employees and the public.\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation has a proactive incident investigation program that acts as a continuous mechanism to evaluate and improve safety.  A Compliance Team consisting of environmental, safety and regulatory affairs representatives conduct weekly audits and follow up of all incident reports.  Incidents are tracked according to the program and a system is in place to coordinate close out of action items and improvement of all environmental and safety control systems.  The Compliance Team conducts monthly training of employees to communicate issues and improvements learned via the audits and incident reports. \n\n\nVer. 9/26/01\n"
