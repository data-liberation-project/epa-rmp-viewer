Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Piatt County Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  Monticello Fire Department, Piatt County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 427 West Marion Street, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of a storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\n4.  Five year accident history.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n-     have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n\n\n-     to our knowledge, have resul"
