      "SummaryText": "POLICY STATEMENT- It is the Jefferson County ESD's policy to operate safe wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment. The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Village Creek WWTP. It is ESD's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the Village Creek WWTP. Although not required by regulation, ESD has installed a chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber to reduce the risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment at the Village Creek WWTP in the event of a release. DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED- The Village Creek WWTP is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment plant. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used primarily for disinfection and dechlorination, respectively. Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling biosolids in the clarification process. The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 20,000 pounds (10 one-ton containers). The chlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, chlorine gas dispensers, chlorine leak detectors, alarms, a chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment. Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorinating the effluent before it is discharged to Village Creek. The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide that can be stored at the facility is 12,000 pounds (6 one-tone containers). The dechlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, sulfur dioxide gas dispensers, sulfur dioxide leak detectors, al"

      "SummaryText": "arms, a chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS- The Village Creek WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68. The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule. A hazard review was conducted at this facility using the What-If analysis. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY- In the past five years, the Village Creek WWTP has not had a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide resulting in injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. Also, there were no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the 5-year period prior to the submittal of the 1999 RMP. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM- The Jefferson County ESD has an emergency response plan for the Village Creek WWTP, which coordinates response efforts with the Birmingham Fire Department, the police department, and the hospital. Response activities also have been coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY- It was observed during the hazard review that the Village Creek WWTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems."
