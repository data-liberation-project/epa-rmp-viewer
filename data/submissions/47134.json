      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\nThe Weatherford Water Treatment Plant is located in Weatherford, Texas at 118 West Lake.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Weatherford.  This facility is a water treatment plant that uses chlorine as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 26,000 pounds of chlorine are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR are stored above threshold limits or utilized at the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored and used and the facility.  However, this material does not exceed the RMP threshold limit.\n\nSafety Policies:\nThe City of Weatherford is fully committed to safety at the water treatment plant.  The Weatherford Utilities Department has long emphasized the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements as an opportunity to further refine its safety program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the water treatment plant and the City Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine, should a release occur.  Finally, the City is committed to continuing to improve its risk management program for chlorine at the Water Purification Plant.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe City's commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine is best exemplified by its excellent track record with this substance.  The Water Treatment Plant experienced a non-fatal injury related to chlorine within the past five years.  This incident was caused by human error.  Additional training of the person causing the incident has been implemented.  The City is not aware of any such accidents prior to the past five years.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nFor the facility's offsite consequence analysis a worst-case scenario was modeled using a one-ton container of chlorine.  Public receptors do exist within this radius, including residences, e"

      "SummaryText": "ducational facilities, parks, and major commercial/industrial buildings.  As required by the risk management regulations, alternative-release scenarios for potential chlorine releases were developed.  Realistic alternatives were modeled, considering the actual conditions at the site.  The resulting radii of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nThe City's worst-case scenario involved failure of a one-ton container of chlorine.  The release rate for the worst-case scenario is 2,000 pounds over a 10-minute period.  Though containers are in a building, mitigation credit was not considered.\n\nOne alternate release scenario for the water treatment plant involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single one-ton container over a 60-minute period in an enclosure with fully functional chlorine scrubber present.  This alternate release scenario shows no offsite impact.\n\nA second alternate release scenario was the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 60-minute period in an enclosure with the chlorine scrubber not working.  In this case, building mitigation was assumed.\n\nPrevention Program Description:\nThe City's prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air will be minimized.  This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program will also become a useful tool in ongoing training of personnel.\n\nThe Program 2 Prevention Program includes seven primary components:\n\n*  Safety Information:  Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n*  Hazard Review:  Regulated proceses at the facility have been reviewed t"

Problems identified by the hazard review are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n*  Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures have been recently updated to account for major process changes.\n\n*  Training:  Plant Personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n*  Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Inspection and testing of regulated process equipment is a requirement as well.\n\n*  Compliance Audits:  The prevention program is audited at least once every three years to evaluate compliance with the risk management rules.  The most recent compliance audit was done on July 18, 2004.  No significant deficiencies were discovered.\n\n*  Incident Investigation:  Accidents involving release, or near release, of the regulated substance are investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation are used to improve the safety of the process."
