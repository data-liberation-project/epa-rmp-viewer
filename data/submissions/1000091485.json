Multi-Chem personnel identify hazards and manage risks to the community and environment through continuous improvement approaches such as improvements to technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is one of Multi-Chem's core values as documented in policy and compliance manuals, and in its mission statement, which are available to all employees. \r\n\r\n2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nAcrolein, also known as 2-propenal, is an aldehyde.  It is present between 92-96% pure in the product received in the acrolein tanks.  It is inhibited by hydroquinone (0.35%) and covered with a nitrogen blanket to prevent hazardous polymerization.  Acrolein is acutely toxic, as well as an inhalation and fire hazard.  Some of the typical physical and chemical properties are listed below:\r\n     \u00bf CAS #107-02-8\r\n     \u00bf Clear, colorless liquid\r\n     \u00bf Acid and pungent odor, extremely irritating\r\n     \u00bf pH 7 \r\n     \u00bf Flashpoint of 13\u00b0F (TCC)\r\n     \u00bf Heavier than air \r\n     \u00bf Can produce exothermic hazardous polymerization reaction\r\n     \u00bf Can be neutralized with soda ash or sodium bisulfite (increasing the pH results in decreased half-life)\r\n     \u00bf OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL), 0.1 ppm\r\n     \u00bf OSHA short term exposure limit (STEL), 0.3 ppm\r\n\r\n3\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Reporting\r\nThe EPA RMP rule requires that Multi-Chem provides information to the EPA and emergency responders about the worst-case and the alternative release scenarios for the RMP regulated chemicals at the Multi-Chem Denver City facility.  Note that the RMP definition of a potential worst-case scenario results in a scenario that is not generally considered credib"

The Multi-Chem RMP includes both worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the toxic chemical present above the threshold quantity on the site.\r\n\r\n4\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nMulti-Chem has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nProcess Information\r\nAcrolein is trucked onto the site in ISO tanks - each ISO tank contains 4,970 gallons (34,783 lbs) of acrolein.  The ISO tanks are detached from motive transport prior to transfer into pressurized skids called \"field containers\".  Each field container can contain a maximum of 399 gallons (2,797 lbs) of inhibited acrolein.  Inhibited acrolein indicates that hydroquinone is added to slow oxygen catalyzed polymerization.  The head space at the top of the field container is also filled with pure nitrogen.  The maximum intended inventory of acrolein at the Multi-Chem facility is 278,623 lbs (twenty-five 2,797 lb acrolein field containers plus six 34,783 lb ISO tanks).  There are no acrolein chemical processes involved at the Multi-Chem facility. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nMulti-Chem has a program in place to ensure that information is available regarding the hazards of the regulated chemicals, the processes that handle these chemicals, and the equipment in the process.  This information is used to identify and understand hazards associated with these chemicals and processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe HAZOP methodology is used by Multi-Chem personnel to systematically identify, analyze, and correct potential hazards associated with the storage, handling, and movement of acrolein at the facility.  After completion of the initial process hazard analysis, the HAZOP has been reviewed and finalized.  The process hazard anal"

The Manufacturing Manager and Denver City Facility Manager are responsible for ensuring that HAZOP recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented.  The Denver City Facility Manager ensures that the affected employees are informed of any changes.  The HAZOP study is revalidated every five (5) years to ensure that the process hazard analysis is consistent with the current process and handling procedures.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nMulti-Chem maintains written operating procedures for the purposes of safely conducting operational tasks within the covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as filling, storage, and emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEach employee presently involved in operating the process and new employees, are trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures for acrolein prior to handling acrolein.  The training includes emphasis on the health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown and safe work practices.  Forklift training and certification is conducted as required by OSHA requirements.  Hazard awareness and container storage and handling training is given to Material Handlers who may have occasion to on or off-load the containers.  Awareness training is given to all employees to provide information on the hazards of the product, to identify the containers, and to avoid potential exposure to the material. \r\n\r\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years or more often if necessary.

Also checked are the container shut-off and safety valves for visual defects.  Containers showing significant defects will be rejected and returned to the supplier, and the serial number documented.  In addition, Multi-Chem personnel check the container to ensure that the weight is in"
