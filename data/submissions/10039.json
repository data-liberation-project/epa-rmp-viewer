The propane facility was designed and installed by a company whose project manager is a registered Professional Engineer with more than twenty years of experience in this field.  The SC State Fire Marshals Department inspected and approved the tank site and reviewed and approved the engineering drawings prior to construction and inspected and approved the propane facility after the system was completed, witnessing the initial transport delivery and filling operation to the tank.  The tank and piping systems were completely leak tested with compressed air prior to filling with propane and again with propane after the initial delivery (9,500 gal.) of propane was completed.  The system is leak free.  The engineering drawings were also reviewed and approved by IRI, who provides the fire insurance on the Dixie-Narco plant.  The cities of Williston and Elko fire departments have visited the propane facility and are prepared to provide emergency fire protection if called upon.\nKey elements of the Executive Summary:\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency responses at Dixie-Narco:\nDixie-Narcos overall approach is to comply with all governmental regulations to the best of its ability.\nDixie-Narco is an active participant in the Barnwell County LEPC.\n2.

      "SummaryText": " the world.  Natural gas is fuel of choice for its heating and drying operations.  Propane-air is used as an alternate fuel when natural gas is interrupted.  Propane is also used to fuel the lift trucks used in plant operations.\n 3.  The worst-case release and alternate release scenarios are as follows:\na.  Worse-case scenario:  The propane tank is at the maximum fill capacity (85% of 30,000 gal. = 107,865 lb.) and a large leak occurs under tank, which gets ignited.  Within 15 minutes this high density fire causes the tank to explode (BLEVE).  RMP*Comp program predicts that the boundary of 1 PSIG pressure will reach 0.4 miles (2,110 ft.) from tank.  If this occurred, damage to public receptors could occur.  However; due to the protected location of the tank and the high level of maintenance the propane tank and system receives, the probability of this occurring is EXTREMELY LOW.  There has not been a propane explosion like this in SC.\nb.  Alternate scenario:  A propane liquid carrying pipe breaks due to physical damage and releases 100 GPM for 10 MIN., which equates to 4,230 lb. of propane.  The propane vapor cloud explodes.  RMP*Comp predicts a 1 PSIG pressure boundary will reach 0.09 mile (475 ft.) from release.  There should not be damage experienced by the public.  The pipe system has been protected from physical damage by fencing and guards.  The probability of occurrence of the alternate scenario is very low.\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe propane system has been certified to comply with NFPA 58 by the SC State Fire Marshals Department.  The system maintenance personnel have been trained in the principles of propane and the proper procedures to employ in handling small fires and other minor emergencies.  The operators who fill the small propane tanks have been trained how to properly and safely fill the tanks.  In the event of a minor problem, the maintenance supervisor, who will take necessar"
