This commitment demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of trained personnel to respond, control and contain the release. Opal Plant is in  compliance of Process Safety Management and of the elements of PSM are in place at the Opal Plant.\nOpal Plant has an Emergency Policy/Procedure manual. This manual and its procedures are updated as needed and annually. The local Emergency Management is located in Kemmerer Wyoming. The plant works closely with this agency and keeps them up to date on our Emergency Plan. \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Opal Plant operates a cryogenic gas liquid extraction process This process consists of 3 cryogenic gas plants. Commercial grade Methane is produced by extracting Propane, Butane, and flammable mixture of natural gas liquids from the inlet gas stream of unprocessed natural gas. The Opal plant also is equipped with a load out facility.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe first worst case scenario with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion involving a rail car full of propane at our load out facility. \nThe amount released would be 36,000 gallon of liquid propane or 152,000 pounds. The distance to a 1psi over pressure (ENDPOINT) would be .4312 miles. The second WCS is the inlet liquid slug catcher had a release. This product would be Pentane.

Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nOpal Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, (7) start-up after turnaround. (8) Upper & lower alarm set points and deviation. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and verified as current and accurate annually.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOpal Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment we have procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing them with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  Opal Plant personnel periodically conduct safety audits on contractor performance to ensure that they are working in a safe manner.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews:\n\nOpal Plant conducts a PSSR on any Plant modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR uses a checklist to verify the modification readiness; it involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verifications that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nOpal Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include employee training, developing written procedures, performs inspection, and testing, correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.  Collectively, these activities form a system that maintains the Mechanical Integrity of the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices:\n\nOpal has established safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety, examples of these include, control of the entry, presence and exit of support personnel, Lockout/ tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance.
