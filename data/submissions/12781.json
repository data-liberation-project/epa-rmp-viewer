This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDegussa-H|ls has a nine-point policy guiding the accidental release prevention program. These are:\n\n1) Use applicable design safety codes and standards as the basis for design, construction, operation, and maintenance in our facilities.\n2) Evaluate facilities, equipment and processes for safety and health concerns.\n3) Use multiple safeguards to provide layers of protection in the design, construction and operation of facilities to prevent a single failure escalating into a catastrophic event.\n4) Document the safety and health evaluation.\n5) Inspect and evaluate process equipment against the design specifications.\n6) Maintain current and complete documentation of the process and equipment throughout the lifetime of the process.\n7) Develop a Management of Change procedure to control minor changes to process technology, operation and maintenance that may affect the safety of the process.\n8) Review all changes to process equipment, procedures and practices to ensure the continued safety of employees and facilities.\n9) Develop inspection and maintenance programs that ensure the continued integrity of facilities.\n\n\nDegussa-H|ls has a nine-point policy guiding the emergency response program. These are:\n\n1) Determine what potential emergency situations could occur, i.e., employee injury, fire, explosion, flood, cold weather, loss of electrical power, gas/chemical release, etc.\n2) Develop written procedures for potential emergencies outlining "

This facility employs 786 personnel. Eight production areas produce 15 products in a continuous production schedule, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: acrolein, ammonia, chlorine, epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid, methyl formate, methyl mercaptan, propylene, trichlorosilane, and trimethylamine.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 400,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud. Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the chlorine storage tank from containing over this amount. Although we have"

Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the propylene storage tank from containing over this amount. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. According to EPA's look-up tables, the 1 psi overpressure boundary from the explosion would reach offsite but would not reach any public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for acrolein is <\" hole in a 2\" transfer line at operating pressure and ambient temperature. The hole results from a partial gasket failure or line damage resulting in a release of 1,100 pounds of gas over a 15-minute period.  The 15-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak, depressurize the line and thus stop the release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. This release has the potential to reach offsite endpoints including public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe ARS for ammonia is <\" hole in a 2\" transfer line at operating pressure and ambient temperature.

We have no incidents in the last five years that meet the RMP reporting requirements.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nDegussa-H|ls maintains a written emergency response program. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid, medical treatment, evacuation plans, and notification of local emergency response.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Degussa-H|ls is coordinated with the Mobile Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Degussa-H|ls has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Degussa-H|ls conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDegussa-H|ls resolves all findings from process hazards analysis, some of which result in modifications to the process.
