The plant, converted  from a Tyson beef processing plant,  primarily manufactures butter from cream produced throughout the country. This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act. \n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe West Point plant handles and stores anhydrous ammonia for its refrigeration operations.  Ammonia storage and handling constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management rule.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.  It is this facility's policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and, in particular, hazardous and regulated substances; and to minimize and eliminate to the extent possible even minor and inconsequential releases of any type.  Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n\n\n\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n\n\n\nA knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\n\nA well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n\nI"

The action plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and emergency response agencies and the plant has interacted with possible responding agencies regarding the plan and activities at the plant.  Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\n \n\nPrevention Program\n\nWest Point Dairy is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, under the EPA Risk Management Rule, the plant is a Program 3 facility with a Program 3 Prevention Program. The OSHA Process Safety Management /EPA Prevention Program consists of facility management policies and procedures which promotes and recognizes process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, and process hazardous chemical materials. The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, maintenance, safe work practices, incident investigation, audit, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\n\n\nWest Point Dairy adheres to the requirements of Process Safety Management and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of Process Safety Management and EPA Prevention Programs.  The Prevention Program consists of several elements and policies which are briefly outlined below.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - Employees are involved in all aspects of the program a"

Employees participate in process reviews, assist with development of procedures, and all other aspects of the program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - All necessary process information and records are maintained including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology, safe operating limits, equipment records and design requirements.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Process hazard analysis and review are conducted by employee teams to identify and correct any perceived hazards.  These reviews are updated regularly, or when change indicates the necessity of additional review.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of operation including emergency operation and shutdown, limits and methods to correct or avoid deviations from limits, safety and health considerations of operations and the chemicals involved, and safety system operation and function.\n\n\n\nOperating Training - All operators are trained initially in the process and its operating procedures and receive refresher training not less than every three years.  In reality, operator training is a continual and ongoing process.  Operator training includes on the job training with more experienced operators and classroom type instruction.\n\n\n\nContractors - Contractor selection includes review of safety performance and programs.  Contractors are oriented to known hazards in the facility, the emergency plan, and are required to adhere to facility safe work practice procedures.  Contractor performance is periodically evaluated as necessary to assure work is completed in a safe and correct manner.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review - A safety review is conducted on any significant modification of the facility to assure that equipment is installed in accordance with design, all necessary procedures including safety procedures are in place, training is completed, and that all requirements of management of change are completed."

The procedure is to assure the safety of the change and to prevent unintended consequences as a result of change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Any incident which results in a significant release or could have reasonably resulted in such a release is promptly investigated by a facility team.  Findings of the investigation and recommendations for corrective action are documented as are the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response - The Process Safety Management/Prevention Program includes the facility Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit - Compliance with the program is audited at least every three years to verify compliance with these procedures.  Findings, if any, are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented.  The audit is conducted by persons knowledgeable of the facility, but not directly connected with the facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nWest Point Dairy has a written Emergency Plan as required by the Risk Management rule and other Environmental Protection Agency and OSHA rules.  This Plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to those responding agencies.  Emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other appropriate agencies such as the local fire department.

Employees receive annual training in the response plan and also receive various safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodically the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also  drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n \n\nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia as a regulated toxic. The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance.  Alternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic, which are more likely events, must also be presented. This information can be found onsite.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Since this is a new operation, the West Point Plant has had no qualifying accidental release in the past five years.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program/OSHA Process Safety Management Program.
