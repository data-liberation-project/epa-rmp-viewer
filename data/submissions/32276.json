The plan was prepared to fulfill the requirements of Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) pursuant to the United States Environmental Protection Administration (USEPA) regulations contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions. This RMP is intended to be used in conjunction with Ardmore Farms' current Process Safety Management (PSM) and Emergency Response Plans.\n\nThese regulations require stationary sources with listed substances present in a process in greater than the threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. This RMP must be registered with USEPA, submitted to appropriate agencies, and made available (in part) to the public. In the Ardmore Farms facility, anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance, is stored in a quantity slightly above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G, 68.150-68.190, which describes the format of the written RMP. Based on a review of the applicable regulations, Prevention Program 3 requirements apply to this facility.\n\nThe written RMP was developed based upon the site visit conducted by HSA in May 2004. During the site visit, the ammonia storage system was examined, the PSM Plan and the previous audit report of the PSM Plan completed in September 2003 were reviewed. HSA also interviewed the plant manager as well as facility personnel familiar with the ammonia system to obtain specifics of the ammonia system. Based on the interviews, there has never been an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, serious injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.

The proposed changes will necessitate an update of the facility's RMP and PSM Plan within six months of the change."
