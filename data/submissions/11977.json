The refrigeration system consists of the following basic \nelements:\n- compressor,\n- controlled pressure receiver,\n- liquid pump,\n- evaporator,\n- condenser, and \n- associated piping and valves.\n\nThis refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  Refer to the attached process flow \ndiagram for further design of the refrigeration system at the Springfield Distribution \nCenter.\n\nThe major components of the refrigeration system including the controlled-pressure \nreceiver at the Springfield Distribution Center are enclosed in a concrete block room \n(compressor room) within the warehouse facility itself.  The only exterior components of \nthe refrigeration system is the condenser and associated piping and valves.  The \ncompressor room has only two access points.  One access point is a door that opens into \nthe warehouse itself and the second access point is a door that leads directly to the outside \nof the facility that remains continuously locked from the inside.  The evaporators are \nsuspended from the ceiling of the warehouse throughout the refrigerated and frozen food \nproduct areas.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as the \nrelease of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line \nfailure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  Basically, a worst-\ncase release is a catastrophic event that destroys the process and/or storage vessels and \ncauses and immediate release of all stored materials.  In order to determine the radius of \nimpact to off-site receptors, an offsite consequence analysis was conducted.  \nRMP*Comp\u0019, developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA"

      "SummaryText": "), was the model utilized to \nperform the calculations for the offsite consequence analysis. The following site-specific \nparameters and required default parameters were utilized to conduct the offsite \nconsequence analysis for the Springfield Distribution Center:\n- Quantity of ammonia liquefied under pressure: 31,780 pounds (present in the largest \nsingle vessel - controlled-pressure receiver (site-specific value)\n- Height of Release:  ground level (default value)\n- Release Duration: 10 minutes (default value)\n- Mitigation Measures:  Release in enclosed space in direct contact with outside air due \nto the presence of two doors one of which leads outside (default value)\n- Topography: Urban Surroundings (site-specific value)\n- Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (default value)\n- Stability Class: F (default value)\n- Air Temperature: 77 degrees Fahrenheit (default value)\n- Compressor Room volume:  59,616 ft3 (site-specific value)\n\nSince the controlled pressure receiver is located within the warehouse, a calculation was \nperformed to assess if the building would fail as a result of the release.  The following \nequation was utilized to determine the building strength as recommended by the EPA:\n\nCompressor Room Volume/Quantity of ammonia \n59,616 ft3/31,780 pounds = 1.88 ft3/pounds\n\nSince the answer is greater than 0.1ft3/pound, the building will be able to sustain and \ncontain an ammonia release.  Therefore, the default values for a Mitigated Release will be \nable to be utilized for calculating the estimated distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  Next, site \nspecific values and default values were input into the RMP*Comp\u0019 model to calculate \nthe Toxic Endpoint and Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  The calculated results \nare 0.14 mg/l and 1.5 miles, respectively.  \n\nIn order for a release of this magnitude to occur, all automated and engineered fail-safe \nmechanisms would have to have been destroyed.  Basically, a catastrophic event like a \ntornado, earthquake, or explosion"

This radius of impact is \nsignificantly smaller than the worst case scenario however; it could still impact the \nsurrounding public.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario model assumes that all of the engineered fail safe measures \npresent in the ammonia refrigeration system at GFS fail.  The fail safe measures that \nwould have to fail include automatic and manual alarms and shutoff mechanisms \nincluding manual shut down of the system following GFS's standard operating \nprocedures by refrigeration personnel.  Therefore, the odds of the alternate release \nscenario described above occurring are still very low.  GFS does feel that this scenario \nhas a greater chance of occurring than the worst case scenario previously described.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nTo prevent the accident release scenarios described above and others outlined in GFS's \nProcess Hazard Analysis at the Springfield Distribution Center, GFS has implemented an \naggressive prevention program since the refrigeration system went on line in 1998.  GFS \nhas made a commitment to understand the environmental aspects and safety aspects of \nthe refrigeration system operations.  In response to this increased knowledge and \nawareness, GFS has devoted much time and effort to insuring the refrigeration system at \nthe Distribution Center is working efficiently, effectively, and safely for not only on-site \nemployees but also the residents and public areas surrounding the Distribution Center.  \n\nGFS is subject to the OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) requirements.  \nTherefore, the PSM program GFS has instituted is in compliance with these standards, at \nminimum.  GFS's prevention program includes the following:\n- Daily manual and automated pressure checks of temperature and pressures in engine \nroom.\n- Weekly inspection of exterior insulation, valve stations, and"

GFS has been able to introduce many engineering fail-safe mechanisms into the \nnew refrigeration system that improve the odds of a release of anhydrous ammonia from \noccurring.  These engineered fail-safe mechanisms have increased the safety for all on-\nsite employees and significantly reduced the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia from \nnot only occurring but also from migrating off-site and impacting the surrounding \nresidences and businesses.  GFS is committed to continually improve the operations of \nthe refrigeration system to continue to reduce the threat of a release occurring.  As part of \nGFS's continual improvement commitment, several administrative improvements are \nproposed for the immediate future.  These administrative improvements include but are \nnot limited to:\n\n- Developing a Hot Work Program for refrigeration contractors,\n- Further enhancing the Compliance Audits Program by developing an Internal \nAuditing Program and peer review from personnel at other Distribution Centers,\n- Continually enhancing the Employee Training Program to allow GFS to obtain the"

      "SummaryText": "would have to destroy the Controlled Pressure Receiver \nlocated inside the warehouse instantaneously to meet the assumptions required by a worst \ncase scenario.  Since the Controlled Pressure Receiver is located in the Compressor \nRoom that has limited access and has no vehicle traffic it is highly unlikely that a \ncatastrophe of this magnitude would occur damaging this vessel.  \n\nAdditionally, the compressor room has only one door that leads to the outside of the \nfacility and it is locked from the inside.  This door is only used for emergency purposes.  \nTherefore, there are no direct outlets present for a release of anhydrous ammonia to \nimpact outdoor air.  \n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nGFS has reviewed their ammonia refrigeration system to determine a more likely release \nscenario.  The Process Hazard Analysis conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process \nSafety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 indicated that a release caused by a hole \nin piping caused by corrosion or a leaking valve along the piping run located on the roof \nof the warehouse is a more plausible release scenario.  Under normal operating \nconditions, the roof-top piping runs are under pressures that fluctuates between 100 to \n130 psig.  The fluctuations in the piping run pressure are due to the change in ambient air \ntemperature.  The absolute maximum pressure possible for this system is 150 psi.  The \nalternate release scenario was calculated assuming the rooftop piping run was damaged \ncreating a 2-inch hole (diameter of the pipe) and the system reaches a maximum possible \npressure of 150 psi.  The release rate was calculated utilizing the Bernoulli Equation:\n\nQR = HA x (203)(Pg)1/2\nWhere:\tQR = Release rate (pounds/minute)\n\tHA = Hole area (square inches)\n\tPg = Gauge pressure (psig)\n\nUsing this equation, the release rate was calculated to be 4972 pounds of anhydrous \nammonia per minute.  Inputting the calculated release rate of 4,972 pounds/minute and \nthe default release duration of 60 minu"

      "SummaryText": "field \nDistribution Center. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nGFS has developed an extensive Emergency Response Program to respond to a chemical \nrelease from the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the Springfield Distribution \nCenter.  GFS has developed in conjunction with the Springfield Fire Department an \nEmergency Response Plan for the Springfield Distribution Center.  The Emergency \nResponse Plan details:\n- pre-emergency planning procedures, \n- GFS's Emergency Response Team organizational structure, \n- training requirements, \n- emergency recognition and prevention procedures, \n- emergency alerting procedures, \n- evacuation procedures, \n- emergency medical services, \n- emergency response procedures, \n- medical surveillance procedures, and\n- post emergency response critique procedures. \n\nGFS has provided not only employee training but also all necessary resources needed to \nadequately, quickly, and safely respond to a release of anhydrous ammonia.  GFS \npersonnel are trained to contact the Springfield Fire Department to respond to and \nmitigate a release of anhydrous ammonia at GFS's Springfield Distribution Center when a \nresulting release approaches 100 pounds or a spill over 35 ppm of ammonia which can \nnot be operationally isolated.\n\nGFS has coordinated with the Springfield Fire Department whose master plan includes \ncoordinating with area hospitals and local emergency response companies to ensure all \nparties are aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event a release does occur.  Off-\nsite notification comes from the Springfield Fire Department according to their direction.  \nUpon their contact they assume the leadership role for emergency response and make all \noff-site evacuation and sheltering communications to the community.\n\nGFS employees required to do work in and around the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration \nsystem, are trained and annually updated in identifying and initially responding to a \nrelease in accordance with the OSHA Standards"
