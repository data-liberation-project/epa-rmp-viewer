              "Description": "An industrial ammonia refrigeration system services the Perishable Distributors of Iowa perishable warehouse located in Ankeny, Iowa.  The system provides refrigeration for an ice cream room, two freezers, a cooler room, a cooler dock, and an ice cream dock.  The combined compressor capacity is 429 tons of refrigeration.  Evaporators are circuited for liquid recirculation and hot gas defrosting.  A machine room houses the compressors, pressure vessels, and control system.\n\nFour rotary screw compressor packages are located in the machine room.  Three economized compressors service the low temperature evaporators (-30?F suction).  One compressor services the high temperature evaporators and liquid subcooling loads (15?F suction).  All compressors have thermosyphon oil cooling.\n\nTwo evaporative condensers are located above the machine room roof.  The condensers are axial fan units with remote water pumps and a water sump. The condenser fans have two-speed motors.\n\nThe evaporators are located in penthouses, with the exception of two ceiling suspended units in the ice cream (Sunrise) dock.  The evaporators are circuited for liquid recirculation, bottom feed, and hot gas defrosting.  The ice cream, freezer, and cooler evaporators are constructed of aluminum tubes and fins.  The dock evaporators are constructed of galvanized tubes and fins.  The evaporator control valves are located outside the penthouses, above the roof.\n\nThe pressure vessels are located in the machine room.  A control pressure receiver, CPR-1, is used as an ammonia storage vessel.  A low pressure receiver, LPR-1, is used to feed the low temperature evaporators.  An accumulator, ACC-1, and liquid transfer unit, LTU-1, are used for liquid sub-cooling and feeding the high temperature evaporators.  A thermosyphon receiver, TS-1, is used for compressor oil cooling.\n\nAll refrigeration system piping is black steel, ASTM A53 Grade B or ASTM A333 Grade 6.  All joints are welded except where impractical for service.  Extruded polystyrene pipe and vessel insulation with PVC or aluminum jacket is applied to all vessels and piping subjected to sweating and frosting.\n\nA microprocessor based system controls the refrigeration system.  The central system controls the compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, and safety controls.  Sensors are used for monitoring temperatures, pressures, vessel liquid levels, and ammonia leak detection.  An operator interface (graphics computer) is used for monitoring, alarming, and set-point changes.  Alarming is provided with an automatic telephone dialer.",

      "SummaryText": "The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse is grocery products storage and distribution facility that contains refrigerated areas.  The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\n    The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 13,000 pounds.\n\n    The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n    The Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worst case scenario considered the loss of the total charge of 13,000  pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10-minute period.  The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 3344 yards or 1.9 miles.  There are approximately  1246 residents who could be potentially affected in the identified radius.  There are other public receptors (schools, day cares, and industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.  There is one en"

      "SummaryText": "vironmental receptor in the potentially affected area.\n\n     The alternative release scenario, which is the most likely scenario, considered a release of ammonia from a compressor seal failure inside the building.  A release of 1000 pounds of ammonia over a 20-minute period was considered.  The computer model showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 181 yards or 543 feet.  There are no public receptors located in the potentially affected area.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\n\n    The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.  The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\n\n    This location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\n        \n    The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  A Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system in February, 2000.  Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Program.  Also, the guidelines from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
