ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE   POLICIES \n\n \n\nMar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC (Mar-Jac) operates a poultry processing plant in Hattiesburg, Mississippi located at 1301 James Street.  Our processing plant produces wholesome, safe, USDA inspected poultry for human consumption.  This process requires that the poultry be processed and stored at low temperatures to prevent spoilage.  Our refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant to achieve the low processing and storage temperatures.  \n\nThis Mar-Jac Facility has an emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n \n\n1.  To save lives. \n\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries. \n\n3.  To protect the environment. \n\n4.  To minimize property damage. \n\n \n\nMar-Jac maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes. \n\nIn case of a major release, plant management will coordinate with the Hazardous Material Team of the Hattiesburg Fire Department in a combined response to the accident.  This response would include public notification and evacuation of the surrounding areas, if necessary.  Plant personnel are trained and drilled on emergency response procedures.  The facility works with the Hattiesburg Fire Department to ensure familiarity with our processes.\n\n\n\n2.

The system is designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, such as the OSHA PSM regulation and local building codes.  \n\nOur facility's refrigeration system is calculated to contain approximately 46,402 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The engine room houses the compressors and ammonia vessels are in and around the facility building.  Evaporators are located inside the facility and mounted to the overheads to provide cooling.\n\n\n\n3.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThis facility was purchased in 1968 by Marshal Durbin Companies and the refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with ammonia refrigeration industry safety and design standards (Uniform Mechanical Code) in effect at that time.  In 2014, Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC purchased the facility from Marshall Durbin.  Since the purchase, Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC has worked to improve the operation and expand the ammonia refrigeration system at the processing plant.\n\nIn addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or near the engine room .  The engine room is provided with continuous ventilation and all equipment are monitored for temperature and pressure 24 hours a day by our refrigeration department.  The facility is secured and guarded at all times. This facility works to operate within the guidelines of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems and manufacturer's operation and maintenance manuals\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC complies with the applicable OSHA regulation and the Process Safety Management Regulation.  Refrigeration equipment is maintained and inspected "

We also use periodic third party inspections by qualified inspectors to ensure the system is operating safely.\n\nAlarm systems are in place to notify the facility of a malfunction of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n4.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere has not been a reportable accident or release in the last 5 years in the refrigeration system.\n\n5.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nMar-Jac has a written emergency response program for emergencies such as ammonia releases, fire and weather.  The ammonia emergency response program directs plant management on how to notify the appropriate agencies and how to respond to a release based on the concentration of anhydrous refrigeration.  In the event of a release that requires evacuation of the off-site area, Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC will work with the Hattiesburg Fire Department and the Forrest Count Emergency Planning Committee as well as other agencies that may be involved.\n\nThe facility employees are notified of an emergency by air horns and by their supervisor who will guide them to the appropriate rally points so that a tally of the employees can be done.  The facility plans for evacuations by performing evacuation drills at least annually.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe facility maintains a membership in the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Refrigeration technicians are trained using programs from RETA.  Mar-Jac Poultry MS, LLC is completing the addition of new refrigeration areas and equipment as well as updating or replacement of some of the existing equipment.  Alarm systems and fire hydrants were added as part of this project.  \n\nIt is our vision to continually improve the operation and maintenance of our equipment and to improve the safety of our employees.\n\n"
