      "SummaryText": "The Manly Terminal, LLC facility in Manly, IA is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions found in Title 40 part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR).  This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule. The facility is covered by the rule because it processes propane in excess of the regulatory thresholds. Propane is transferred and stored at the facility and is a listed chemical due to flammability.  The Manly Terminal, LLC facility is a product storage and transfer facility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years. The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity. The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement. The RMP will be made available to the public. The purpose of this project was to compile an updated RMP.\r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving propane. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that a total release of a railcar's contents would result in a release of 128,000 pounds of propane to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP Comp. The distance at which the propane concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 0.4 miles. It was further determined that within 0.4 miles of the facility there is a population of approximately 10 people. There were no public receptors identified within 0.4 miles of the facility other than the residences.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release of propanes resultin"
