Fresh Mark Massillon's directors, managers, supervisors, etc. are accountable to carry out the policies relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Fresh Mark Massillon has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases. The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation. Fresh Mark Massillon has coordinated with public responders and emergency services to help ensure the safety of the public.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Massillon is a further processing facility. Meat is received and processed for human consumption. To preserve the meat and prevent bacteria contamination, an extremely hazardous substance is utilized, anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in various stages of the process. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Massillon has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely. Fresh Mark Massillon has aggressively developed programs, policies and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. The programs include compliance with OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards. Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with highly hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEA"

      "SummaryText": "R ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Massillon has not had a reportable accidental release of ammonia during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nAn onsite Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Team is trained to respond to releases and effectively minimize the release. Training for emergency response team members is conducted at least annually. \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include: improved maintenance procedures and periodicity, addition of new technology as it becomes available and continued training of facility and response personnel."
