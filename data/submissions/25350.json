These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental injuries, illnesses, fatalities and property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including the use, storage, manufacturing, handling, on-site movement or any combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels, which are interconnected and separate vessels, which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment.  These procedures are detailed and will be improved and reviewed as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility."
