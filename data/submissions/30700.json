Information has been updated to reflect the fact that this facility has recently had an additional storage tank installed, along with much of the piping and valving being replaced with new.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe at Cooperative Elevator Co. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our  trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Sherman Twp. Fire Dept. which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Storage and transfer of agricultural anhydrous ammonia..  \nThe product is stored in one of two separate 18,000 gallon capacity tanks, which, for safety purposes, are never filled beyond 85% full. There would be 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in each  tank when 85% filled.\n\n              \n                                                                                                                                              \n\n\n\n\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility complies with the requirements of several regulations, including requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Is also complies with other Federal, and State regulations.\nAdditionally, our facility is inspected reg"

Any recommendations made are promptly followed.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\nCooperative Elevator Co. has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes various aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nHuron County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. The plan is reviewed at least annually, and promptly updated when necessary.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAdditional barricades have been installed to prevent facility traffic from entering the area of the piping and storage area."
