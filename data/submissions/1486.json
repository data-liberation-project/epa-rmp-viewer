Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n     The owners and employees of C & M Supply are committed to the prevention of\nany accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, we\nare prepared to work with the local fire department and other emergency response\nauthorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n2. Facility information\n\n     C & M Supply is an ag-supply business that sells fertilizers, farm chemicals, and\nfuels.  Our facility\u0012s main plant is in Ruskin, Nebraska, but we also operate a satellite\nplant near the town of Oak, Nebraska.  This facility has no permanent on-site employees\nand serves mainly as a storage facility.  The Oak plant holds a reportable quantity of\nanhydrous ammonia for storage and distribution to customers.  The maximum quantity of\nanhydrous ammonia stored in our two tanks (12,000 gallons and 8,000 gallons) is 82,000\npounds.\n\n3. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia worst case:  The worst-case release scenario would be the\nrelease of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes. \nThe maximum quantity released would be 49,000 pounds, which represents the weight of\nthe contents of the storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by company operating\nprocedures.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is\n1.4 miles.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia alternative:  The alternative release scenario based on the\nmost likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to\nthe endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is 0.92 miles.\n\n4. Accidental release prevention program\n\n     For the handling of anhydrous ammonia, the facility has implemented the\nprovisions of \u0013Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\nAmmonia,\u0014 K-61.1, published by"

Five-year accident history\n\n     Our facility has not had any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last\nfive years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or any\nknown offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or\nenvironmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency response program\n\n     The facility has prepared a written emergency action plan, in accordance with\nOSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided authorities the emergency planning and\ncommunity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); and\nhas prepared a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard\n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations\nare performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional\nspecific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
