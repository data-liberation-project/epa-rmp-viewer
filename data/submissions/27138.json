Cincinnati, Ohio facility management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) herein in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the potential of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Morton employees, the community and the environment.  This objective is met by continuing to utilize good operating and environmental, health and safety procedures, participating in Responsible Care, providing appropriate training to all employees, and communicating and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers.\n\nMorton has taken a number of steps to minimize the quantity of hazardous compounds that are stored on-site.  For example, the facility has reduced the inventory of propane to a level that is below the RMP threshold.\n\nFacility Description\n\nMorton International's Cincinnati, Ohio facility operates primarily as a manufacturer of specialty chemicals.  Three chemicals - Chlorine, Methyl Chloride and Ammonia - are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the RMP requirements detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  All chemicals used at the facility, including those regulated by the RMP, are handled and stored using best management practices.\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated chemicals under well-defined conditions.  Two types of releases must be considered: a \"worst case scenario\" must be examined as well as an \"alternative case scenario\".\n\nBy EPA regulations the \"worst case scenario\" is defined as the catastrophic rupture of the vessel (or pipe) that causes the maximum quantity of the regulated chemical to be released.  The EPA specifies that all of the regulated chemic"

In addition, the \"worst case scenario\" requires us to assume all process controls, safety devices, monitoring and detection systems fail to operate as designed.  Further, worst case scenarios do not consider possible causes or likelihood of the event.\n\nThe EPA also defines the conditions under which the evaporated material dissipates including conservative assumptions regarding the temperature, wind speed and the tendency for \"mixing\" to occur in the atmosphere.  These EPA assumptions are such that the predicted concentration of the chemical represents an over-estimate of what would actually occur.\n\nBy EPA regulations the \"alternative release scenario\" is an emergency planning release scenario that must lead to an off-site impact based on a facility's use of the regulated chemical.  The emergency planning scenario takes into account the facility's safety systems and response plans to minimize the release.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios provided within this RMP have been developed by considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g. hose leaks, seal failures, safety valve releases) that have involved chemicals, items that have been identified through HAZOP process and those associated with the chemical industry in general.  The RMP regulations provide for the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst case consequence analysis indicated that using the EPA guidelines there could be off-site impact in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of chlorine from the rail car (defined by the  RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact the surrounding community.  The alternative release scenarios that were developed for each chemical indicated that the impact zone would be significantly reduced by comparison to that predicted for the worst case scenario.\n\nThe likelihood of either of these scenarios occurring is very small demonstra"

In fact, the reduced impact areas of the alternative scenarios compared to the worst case scenario is one measure of the effectiveness of Morton's prevention and safety programs.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nMorton International has had two releases of Chlorine from the Cincinnati, Ohio facility that has resulted in two injuries which required medical treatment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMorton Cincinnati, Ohio facility is staffed with employees trained in emergency response 24 hours per day.  These emplyees receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\n\nThe local emergency responders in the community utilize lap-top computers containing CAMEO and ALOHA for determining the likely extent of impact from a release.  Hence, the facility chose to use these programs, in conjunction with guidance developed by the USEPA, to determine the extent of the area predicted to be impacted under the various scenarios described above.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMorton completes a thorough review of the potential impact of all chemicals considered for use at the facility prior to their use and on a continuous basis.  This also includes compounds that are not specifically addressed under the RMP regulation.  Morton has reviewed the chemicals currently used on site as part of the compliance program involving the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, RCRA, Spill Prevention and Contingency Planning and Accidental Release prevention.  Further, Morton conducts Process Safety Management reviews at least every three years to ensure that each process that utilizes hazardous chemicals are thoroughly examined, including Hazardous and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Major Accident Prevention Program (MAPP) studies.  \n\nMorton strives to continually improve employee training, chemical processes, control technology, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\n\nGe"

      "SummaryText": "neral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Cincinnati facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and the environment.  These regulations include:\n40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures\n40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\nThe key concepts in Morton's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, appropriate training of all employees, and ongoing communication and training with local responders.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Morton management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia solution, chlorine, and methyl chloride.  Morton employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nMorton policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes.  This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Morton maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nMorton is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, Morton conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance person"
