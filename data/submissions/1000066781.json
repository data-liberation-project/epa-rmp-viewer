Every order had their personal promise of 100% customer satisfaction. Today, our promise remains the same. Though the world's greater demands for environmental responsibility and business efficiencies create a broader sense of commitment, this challenge has only strengthened our resolve. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAstro Chemicals' approach to chemical safety starts at the beginning with a New Product / Process Change Review. This includes input by the sales person, purchasing, quality control and the regulatory department to identify the hazards of a product to determine if Astro can safely store, transport, or in some cases repackage for Astros' customer(s).  To move forward Astro will then communicate the requirements to the operations personnel in one of three ways: through a new or existing written procedure, the development of a check list, or verbal instruction.  Managerial over site is provided on a case by case basis.\n\n\n\nAstro prevention program is centered on good warehousing practices as mandated by the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution which can be found at http://www.nacd.com/dist_process/National Association of Chemical Distributors \n\n\n\nResponsible Distribution Code of Management Practice \n\nEach member company shall have an active program designed to continuously improve safety and reduce incidents. This Code does not impose upon member companies any obligation to guarantee compliance by third parties, i.e., parties over whom the member companies have no control. This program shall include:  \n\nI. Risk Management \n\nII. Compliance Review and Training \n\nIII. Carrier Selection \n\nIV. Handling and Storage \n\nV. Job Procedures and Training \n\nVI. Waste Management and Conservation Practices \n\nVII. Emergency Response and Public Preparedness \n\nVIII. C"

Document and Records Control \n\n\n\nAstro Chemicals and the Regulated Substances:\n\nAstro as a Chemical Distributor has been successfully handling both Ammonia and Hydrochloric Acid 37% in quantities below threshold along with other regulated chemicals.  Ammonia and Hydrochloric Acid 37% are currently logistics and warehousing opportunity for Astro. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program: \n\nThe combination of Responsible Distribution&reg; and Astro's Quality Management System has established written procedures, checklists, internal audits, and training review of safe repackaging, storage and distribution of chemicals at both facilities.  Frequent safety meetings are held for all warehouse shifts including monthly drivers' hours of service review.   Astro additionally provides updates to employees of applicable rules, regulations, customer needs and trends that are in need of attention.  These all serve as training sessions to a variety of regulatory requirements.
