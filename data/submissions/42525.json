      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBroad River Waste Treatment Plant\n\nThe Board of Public Works of Gaffney, South Carolina ( BPW ) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This policy complies with all the applicable requirements of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program(RMP).  The BPW Risk Management Program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility.\n\nThe Broad River Waste Treatment Plant, the Clary Waste Treatment Plant, the Cherokee Water Treatment Plant, and the Victor Gaffney Water Treatment Plant are facilities owned by the BPW that exceed the OSHA Process Safety Management Program ( PSM ) ( 29 CFR 1910.119 ) threshold limit of 1500 pounds for Chlorine ( CAS: 007782-50-5 )and 1000 pounds for for sulfur Dioxide (CAS: 7446-09-5) at the Clary and Broad River WWTP's.  These facilities are manned and are required by 1910.119 to establish a PSM program.  The BPW has implemented a PSM program that is unique to each facility.  Presently, all the facilities exceed the threshold limit of 2500 pounds of chlorine established by CAA 112r,therefore, each facility has implemented a Risk Management Program based on CAA 112r Program 3 requirements. In addition, the Clary and Broad River WWTP's exceed the threshold limit of 5000 pounds for sulfur dioxide established by the requirement.\n\nEach facility has special characteristics such as number of employees, hours the facility is manned, density of the surrounding population, and public receptors that required the BPW to develop RMP for each of the facilities.  The facilities use many technological and managerial practices that are not unique, in fact are common in the water-waste water treatment industry. Liquid chlorine is delivered to each of the facilities in ton cylinders and placed in a tank s"

Gaseous Chlorine, collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperature, is piped off by a vacuum chlorinating system and injected into potable water to form a solution of hypochlorite.  The solution is piped to contact chambers for the purpose of disinfecting water and wastewater.  The equipment at each facility includes a tank storage area, chlorinator room that contains the chlorinators, flow recorders, various safety equipment, and electrical panels. Gaseous Sulfur Dioxide collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperture,  is piped off by a vacuum sulfurnating equipment mixed with water and injected below the contact chamber.  A compete listing of equipment, along with block flow diagrams, and pipe and instrumentation diagrams are included in the BPW PSM for each facility.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis, required by CCA, includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, and two sulfur dioxide scenarios identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative scenario?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion model was performed for each facility based on the RMP COMP VER. 1.07. The RMP COMP PROGRAM was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the ? toxic endpoint? selected by EPA of 3 ppm or 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine and 0.0078 mg/L for sulfur dioxide, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or develop"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined, ? to estimate the population potentially affected?. \n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELESE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Broad River Wastewater Treatment Plant involves a failure of a one ton cylinder (a total of 2000 lb. of chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  The conditions for the worst case scenario are pre-defined by EPA (release of the entire amount of gas in 10 minutes).  The rate of release is equal to the amount in the cylinder divided by the time of the release or 2000 lb. / 10 minutes = 200 lbs. per minute.  The facility has containment walls, but not to the degree that the walls should be considered passive mitigation.  This  includes the following conditions: rate of release 200 lb. per minute, urban conditions, f stability, 1.5 meters per second wind speed, 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine and 0.0078 mg/L for sulfur dioxide toxic endpoint.  \n\nWhen the RMP COMP analysis for worst case scenario is used to obtain the distance endpoint, an area of concern can be determined in order to obtain an estimate of the population affected.  In addition, other public receptors can be identified including schools, businesses, industries, and recreational facilities.  Information with respect to the receptors identified for the worst case scenario for the Broad River Waste Treatment Plant can be viewed by contacting the BPW at the main office.  Interested persons can also view the RMP of the Broad River Plant by contacting an EPA Viewing site.   \n\n\nATERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Broad River Waste Treatment Plant involves the misalignment of the vacuum regulator valve that is connected to a ton cylinder.  This connection requires the use of a lead or composite washer.  Misalignment of the washer or impr"

      "SummaryText": "oper torsion of the valve fitting could would cause a leak.  The leak would occur on the tank side of the vacuum regulator causing a pressure leak approximately equal to the tank pressure.  This scenario would allow chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas to escape through a 3/8 inch (or smaller) opening resulting in the release of 960 lbs. of chlorine or sulfir dioxide over a 60 minute release period   (16 lb/min).  The calculation for the release rate is taken from the EPA reference guide, section 8.1 and is as follows: QR (release rate) = HA (hole area in square inches) x Pt (tank pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) x 1/square root of  Tt (tank temperture-kelvin) x GS (gas factor). \n\nBased on RMP COMP VER. 107 dispersion modeling (Dense Gas Distances to Toxic Endpoint) which assumes a 60 minute release, urban conditions, D stability, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, toxic endpoint for chlorine of 0.0087 and 0.0078 for sulfur dioxide and a release rate of 16 lb/min. the toxic endpoint would be reached in the alternative scenario at 0.1 miles or 528 feet.\n\nThe receptors identified for the Alternative case scenario for the Broad River Waste Treatment Plant are as follows: population affected 00; schools 0; business and industry 00; parks and recreation 00; environmental 0.  \n\nMITIGATION\n\nEven if the personnel responsible for the misalignment had left the tank storage area, actuation of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide detector would cause the on duty operator to respond to the alarm. The response of the operator would take 60 minutes or less and is an active mitigation measure.  An additional active mitigation system is the remote vacuum type chlorinators and sulfurnators.  This system will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine or sulfur dioxide released in the case of a piping rupture. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Broad River Plant is based on the elements of the OSHA PSM Program.
