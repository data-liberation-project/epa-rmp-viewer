There is the possibility of two  2,000 LB cylinders connected to a switch over valve, at the PRWID Culinary Water Plant.  The chlorination system works on a Vacuum type system, which if damaged will not allow leakage into the plant atmosphere.  Three very remote possibilities exist that could cause a chlorine leak into the air.  The first is a fire, Second is an extreme operator error, Third a major natural disaster such as earthquake, Flood, or Landslide.  Even if there was a major leak the employees are trained and practiced with a class B, one ton chlorine cylinder repair kit.  The employees are also trained and practiced in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (air packs).  There are two chlorine detection alarm sensors that are tested and calibrated monthly. In the event of a chlorine leak the plant that will sound an alarm-notifying employees of the danger present. The Superintendent and lead operator and other department supervisors, have cellular phones in the possible event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n   There have not been any chlorine leaks or incidents in the last 5 years.
