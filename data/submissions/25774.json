Department of Health Services Notification Policy\n\n     Plant Emergency Alarm         \n          Recognition, Initiation, Evacuation, and Assembly\n\n     Plant Emergency Plan Responsibilities\n\n     Emergency Procedures - General     \n          Fire Incident\n          Earthquake\n          Flooding\n          Bomb Threat\n          Off-site Leaks and Spills (Transportation Incidents)\n          Emergency Procedures - Chemical Spills/Releases (General Information)\n          Section I - Chemical Spills/Releases (Other than Acutely Hazardous Materials)\n          Section II - Chemical Spills/Releases (Acutely Hazardous Materials)\n     \n     Emergency Procedures - Employee Training\n          Employee Safety Training (General Overview)\n          New Employee Training\n          Basic Operator Training and Continuous Training\n          Emergency Drills\n          Training Records\n\n     Plant Inventories and Equipment Information\n          Site Map\n          Hazardous Material Plot Plan and Tank Designations\n          Emergency Safety Equipment List\n          Chemical Inventory\n\nThere are two substances at the Polypure facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR Part 68.

      "SummaryText": "re regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR\nPart 68 are as follows:\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n          Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent solution in water. \n     The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 65,000 pounds\n     (24,000 pounds 100 percent basis formaldehyde).\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n          Dimethylamine: The maximum amount dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately\n     260,000 pounds of 60 percent dimethylamine.  This quantity includes the volume that may be\n     present in a railcar located on-site.\n\n\nWorst-case Scenarios:\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios\nwere evaluated and are discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst case scenarios are presented in\nthe RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternative scenarios were\nprepared for each of the toxic substances with worst case endpoints located offsite and for one\nflammable substance.  The endpoint for a toxic substance represents the distance at which a released\nsubstance must travel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The\nworst-case endpoint for a flammable substance is an over-pressure of 1 psi, which was chosen by U.S.\nEPA as the threshold for potential serious injuries to people as the result of property damage caused\nby an explosion.\n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  In addition, scenarios from releases occurring from smaller vessels\nat higher temperatures or pressures or closer proximity to the site boundary were also reviewed.  The\nscenarios with the greatest distance to the endpoint for a toxic and for a flammable substance were\nselected for presentation in the RMP.  For the worst-case analysis, t"

      "SummaryText": "he possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The release\nis simply assumed to take place and the greatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly released.  The\nresults of the worst-case scenario analysis were as follows:\n\n          Toxic Substances: A reactor, which operates at an elevated temperature, was assumed to\n     fail and subsequently produce an instantaneous release of the entire vessel contents.  The\n     release was assumed to evaporate over a 10-minute time period.  The passive mitigation control\n     of the process area dike was considered in limiting the release impacts.  The distance to the\n     toxic endpoint was estimated to be less than 0.57 miles.\n\n          Flammable Substances: A dimethylamine railcar was assumed to fail and subsequently  \n     produce an instantaneous release of the entire vessel contents that results in a\n     vapor cloud explosion.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the\n     release impacts.  The distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than\n     0.37 miles.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect public\nreceptors.  For formaldehyde the release was assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or\nrupture of a  transfer hose during unloading operations into a contained area.  For flammable\nmaterials, the alternative release scenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of\nthe uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. The durations for releasing\nthese materials from a vessel/pipe for the alternative release scenarios were assumed to occur\nover a 3-minute time period for formaldehyde and a 20-minute period for dimethylamine since the\nunloading operations are supervised.  With the exception of considering that these transfer\noperations are monitored by personnel at all times, no other active mit"

Planned changes and policies to\npromote this improvement include the continuous review and update of the plant safety program\nand annual emergency drills to determine and improve upon deficiencies.  Efforts to update and\nimplement additional safe work practices and policies are ongoing and include areas such as:\n\n     Hazard Communication\n     Confined Space Entry\n     Line Breaking Procedures\n     Lock-out Tag-out\n\n                    "
