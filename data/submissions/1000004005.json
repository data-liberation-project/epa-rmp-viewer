Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation methods.  Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances.  Those regulated flammable substances on location at the Chevron Hawaii Refinery include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, propadiene, butane, butene, 1,3-butadiene, 2-methylpropylene, Isobutane, and pentane. These substances are generally handled as part of a flammable mixture.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Hawaii Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Process (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in PSM through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses.  The importance of Refinery safety is mentioned as part of every organizational meeting.  Safety topic presentations are frequently included as part of meeting agendas and responsibility for these presentations is often rotated among employees to give everyone a chance to participate.

These audits include Weekly Safety Audits, Industrial Hygiene surveys, Insurance Audit, Loss Prevention surveys, and Corporate Operational Excellence Reviews.  These audits/surveys ensure the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations.\n\nSafety Meetings\n\nSafety meetings are conducted weekly for maintenance personnel and periodically for other employees on an as-needed basis. Additionally, morning Operations meetings are held each weekday and Head Operators bring any safety concerns that need to be addressed.  Management personnel coordinate the meetings or participate as observers to answer concerns of employees.  Management personnel also conduct monthly LPS Stewardship meetings to review previous incidents and work with employees to identify any target areas.\n\nSafety Steering Council\n\nThe Refinery Safety Steering Council is made up of members from all levels and work groups in the Refinery.  The council addresses overall safety, fire and health programs and serves as a communications channel between work groups and the Refinery Management Team.  The council helps evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the programs, and works towards addressing work force concerns.\n\nLoss Prevention System (LPS)\n\nLPS is a behavior-based system designed to help prevent and resolve unplanned losses such as environmental releases, process safety incidents, and injury to personnel.

An incident investigation addresses the following: 1) the nature of the incident, 2) the factors that contributed to the incident and 3) solutions identified as a result of the investigation.  The investigation determines the root cause of the incident and may include interviewing involved personnel, as well as reviewing process and equipment data, applicable procedures, operating conditions and training records.  \n\nThe TapRooT Incident Investigation or 5 Why Investigation techniques are used as the guide for all incident investigations.  Incidents with the potential to impact personnel or the environment are investigated.\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nProcess Safety Information is one of several elements of the Refinery's PSM system.  Each Refinery plant or process area has an Electronic Operating Manual that contains a compilation of safety and design related information.  Its purpose is to train and inform employees and contractors of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the units. All process safety information is available to all employees. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each PSM covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is known as the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis.

The PSSR consists of several independent reviews, including a Plant Protection Review, a Safety in Designs Review, a Plant Readiness Review, and confirmation that training of all employees involved in the equipment operation or maintenance has been completed.   \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  The Refinery has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment, tankage and utilities, and instrumentation and safety systems.  Training is routinely conducted on these practices and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.  The Refinery also has an Integrated Mechanical Inspection (IMI) program within the Reliability Group that is responsible for identifying machinery-related "

Members of the Reliability Group are consulted whenever buying new machinery or when a machine design change is being considered.        \n \nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has safe work practices in place that help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include but are not limited to: 1) the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous work areas, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance, 4) a permit procedure to control activities that maybe a source of ignition (i.e., hot work), and 5) the controlled entry of personnel into plant areas.  The Refinery safe work practices along with training of personnel who may be involved with these types of work form a system that aides in making sure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) is one element of the Refinery's PSM system. The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  MOC applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures, or technology.  \n\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, electrical classification, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an \"authorization to implement and start up "

Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe RefineryA?s PSM program is audited periodically to ensure procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years with an audit team composed of various subject matter experts from within the company who are not employed by the Hawaii Refinery. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on file in the PSM Coordinator's office.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRefinery processes have hazards associated with them that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The PSM program that has been discussed in this document applies to all RMP processes at the Refinery.  The program activities as a whole reduce the likelihood of accident scenarios that could be due to equipment failure and/or human error.\n\nThe Refinery also has safety features within the process units designed to quickly detect, contain and control, and reduce the consequences of the release.  The following is a listing of various safety measures used in Refinery processes:\n\nRelease Detection:            Low/High Pressure Alarms.\n                    Low/High Level Alarms.\n                    Hydrocarbon Detection Alarms.\n                    Hydrogen Sulfide Detection Alarms.\n\nRelease Containment/Control:            Process relief valves that are designed to\n                                        relieve to the flare system for incineration.\n                    Automatic shutdown systems.\n                    Bermed areas to contain liquid releases\n                                        Spill containment equipment - absorbent pads and\n                                        "

Over the past five years, there have been no accidents involving RMP regulated substances.  As previously mentioned, the Hawaii Refinery thoroughly investigates \"Near Losses\" or A?LossesA? to determine the root cause or causes.  Lessons learned from the investigation are documented and communicated throughout the Refinery to prevent similar accidents from occurring.  Investigation findings indicating needed changes in operating procedures are implemented.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan describing procedures to protect worker safety and the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released accidentally.  The plan includes:\nA?    Procedures and information on all aspects of emergency response\nA?    The incident command system which is the organizational structure used during\n        emergency response\nA?    Fire fighting equipment and procedures\nA?

There are also procedures in place for the testing and maintenance of emergency\n        response equipment and procedures for equipment operation.  \n\nHypothetical drills are conducted on a regular basis.  These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating \"what if\" situations that stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations.  Hypothetical drills include plant drills and formal drills.  During a plant drill, operating situations that may be a potential fire problem are presented and the group goes through the motions of extinguishing the fire.  Other Refinery personnel may be asked to participate depending on the degree of the drill and apparatus required.  Formal drills on a larger scale are scheduled periodically.  These drills can include outside agencies, and participants treat this hypothetical drill situation as if it is a real fire and respond accordingly.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chevron Refinery is coordinated with the Oahu Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which has members from the local emergency response community, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Campbell Industrial Park (CIP), where the Refinery is located, has collective emergency management available by way of the CIP CLEAN Emergency Resources Guide.  This guide compliments Refinery resources and is used as a focal point for coordinating emergency response and management for CIP.  The CIP CLEAN Emergency Resources Guide, along with the Refinery plan, is used as a reference during drills for notifications to the appropriate agencies and neighboring businesses.  Tabletop drills are conducted on a periodic basis using the Plan and a hypothetical release scenario.  The LEPC is involved in conducting these drills and other response agencies, inclu"

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety Section\n\nIn 2008, we implemented the Loss Prevention System (LPS) to our entire organization. LPS highlights types of risks present in everyday jobs by utilizing behavioral observation.  Once these risks are highlighted, solutions are developed and addressed. LPS also provides a Loss Prevention Self Assessment tool designed to help our employees assess, analyze, and act to mitigate risks associated with the various work tasks performed throughout the work day. The Hawaii Refinery will continue to use the Loss Prevention System to promote the desired behaviors needed to achieve incident and injury free operation. \n\nThe Chevron Hawaii Refinery has achieved recognition form the Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health (HIOSH) Department for Merit-Mentor status under HawaiiA?s version of OSHAA?s Voluntary Protection Program.  The Chevron Hawaii Refinery will continue, in partnership with HIOSH and the Labor Force, to make safety improvements and improve the safety culture in our facility. We will work to maintain our Hawaii Voluntary Protection Merit-Mentor status.\n"
