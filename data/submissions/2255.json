(GELP) facility is located one mile southwest of Gordonsville near State Route 860 in Louisa County, Virginia.  The site is bounded by woodlands, wooded wetlands, and rolling hills.    The Gordonsville facility is a dual fuel-fired, combined-cycle nominal 240-MW power generation facility, located on an 8-acre parcel of land in the northwest corner of Louisa County.  The electric power is sold, under two Power Purchase Agreements, to Virginia Power.  Steam generated during this process is sold to a nearby host.   The primary fuel for the combustion turbines is natural gas, obtained from the Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline, which runs northwest to southeast approximately one mile west of the site.  The backup fuel is No.2 fuel oil and is included in the design to ensure continuous operation in the event of a disruption in the supply of natural gas.  The site is at an elevation of 447 feet above mean sea level.\n\nThe Gordonsville Energy Facility is co-owned by Edison Mission Energy (Irvine, CA) and Calpine Corp. (San Jose, CA).  The plant is operated by Edison Mission Operations and Maintenance (Irvine, CA).  The owners and operators are well known and established companies in the non-utility power and cogeneration field, with worldwide assets and operations.  \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies are supported at the highest level.  The corporate commitment to both Safety and Environmental awareness and compliance can been seen clearly through the company's Vision and Values Statement:\n1) Customer Satisfaction; Our paramount concern is to serve our customers.\n2) Organizational Effectiveness; Promote excellence in operating practices, safety and communication.\n3) Belief in the Individual; People are our greatest asset.\n4) Respect for the Community and the Environment; We have a responsibility to our community and a duty to protect the e"

This is to insure their asset is complying with the appropriate Federal and State regulations.  \n\nChemical safety training through Hazcom, PPE, and Hazwoper programs reinforce the criticality of chemical safety to operations personnel.   Operations personnel conduct inspections on every shift to minimize the consequences of potential leaks or process problems.\n\n\n\nGELP reports the use of only one regulated substance listed by 40 CFR '68.130, that being aqueous ammonia (concentration 20% or greater), CAS# 7664-41-7.  The solution used at GELP is 29.4%.  This solution is used in the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds that are produced during the combustion of fossil fuels.\n\nReduction of stack NOx is done through a two step method.  First, minimize the formation of NOx compounds during combustion, then reduce the amount of NOx in the flue gas by catalytic reaction.\n\nThe combustion turbines use a state of the art burner technology called Dry Low NOx, while on natural gas, this burner configuration offers extremely low NOx emissions.  When burning No.2 fuel oil, demineralized water is injected into the combustors to reduce flame temperatures and the formation of NOx.  To reduce the NOx emissions even further, aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected into the flue gas. By vaporizing the ammonia and injecting it in the flue gas upstream of a catalyst, the ammonia (NH3) functions in the presence of the catalyst to decompose the NOx contained in the flue gas into nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).\n\nThe worst case release scenario for GELP was dictated through use of the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance For Offsite Consequence Analysis document.   The scenario was examined by using both the worksheets furnished with the guidance document and by"

      "SummaryText": "using the EPA's RMP*COMP software, both methods agreed well with each other.  The result places GELP into the Program 2 level.\n\nThe dictated scenario says the worst case will be a spill of the entire volume of storage (25,000 gallons), outside the containment structure on smooth ground, and this will occur on the hottest ambient day measured at the site in the previous three years.  Also dictated is that the ammonia fraction (29.4%) will evaporate in the first 10 minutes of the spill.  It is with this information that the worksheets and the RMP*COMP program says the toxic endpoint or the distance from the spill to the 0.14mg/l concentration of ammonia will be 1.3 miles.    That distance will include public receptors, and therefore places us in the Program 2 level.   Although understandable to use these parameters for a worst case condition, the probability of such a failure is low as the site does have 100% containment around the storage tank, and a graveled surface, both of which decrease the toxic endpoint distance considerably. \n\nThe alternative release scenario guidelines were also issued in the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance For Offsite Consequence Analysis  (OCA) document.  The guidelines state the Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond your fenceline.1  The OCA document states For alternative release scenarios, you are allowed to consider active mitigation systems, such as interlocks, shutdown systems, pressure relieving devices, emergency isolation systems, and fire water and deluge systems, as well as passive mitigation systems as described in Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.3.2\n\nAn alternative scenario was chosen that grossly exaggerates a probable release, primarily to meet the EPA's guidelines that the toxic endpoint be beyond the fenceline, and to also demonstrate that even with this improbable scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint would not involve a publi"

The alternative scenario modeled a 3/4 pipe line rupture while the ammonia transfer pumps were running (providing system pressure), assuming the hottest day in the past three years, and the leak going undetected for an hour.  With these parameters and using the EPA's RMP*Comp modeling program, the toxic endpoint distance was 0.1 mile, therefore no public receptors would be involved.\n\nGELP employs several practices to provide a thorough accidental release prevention program.  100% containment around the ammonia storage tank and transfer pumps, operator inspection of piping and systems on a per shift basis, leak detection monitors in the containment area, and leak detection monitoring on the tank to warn of excessive product use.  The operations staff has been trained on chemical safety, first aid, emergency contingency plans, Hazard Communication, Hazardous Waste and Operations and Emergency Response training.\n\nGELP has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility.  We have a qualified contracting agency's on standby that will respond to chemical spills and cleanup operations, and we have confirmed our inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee. \n\nPlanned safety and leak prevention improvements to the site include the installation of a rate of change detector for ammonia tank level, an ammonia sensor/alarm/strobe to alert personnel in the event of a leak in the containment, a mirror mounted on the containment wall so that operators may inspect the containment without potentially exposing themselves to spilled vapors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Chapter 6, page 6-1.\n2 Chapter 6, page 6-1."
