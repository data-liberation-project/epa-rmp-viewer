      "SummaryText": "Orange County Utilities (OCU) owns and operates the Eastern Regional Water Production Facility (WPF) located at 9100 Curry Ford Road in Orlando, Florida.  Like numerous other water treatment facilities in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated water.  The popularity of chlorine as a water disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and ability to provide a low but measurable residual in the water supply.\n\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community and the environment.  Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from much higher chlorine exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\n\nOrange County's commitment at the Eastern Regional WPF is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented operating procedures and extensive training, and providing the emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a release, should one ever occur.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is Orange County's policy to adhere to all appliable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine is received by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) standards.

      "SummaryText": "arrival at the site, all chlorine cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the cylinders are stored inside an enclosure equipped with gas scrubber.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOCU's PSM document contains 13 essential release prevention elements.  Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:\n\n* Process hazard analysis to identify potential fail modes and measures to minimize their occurrence.\n* Training programs given to each employee operating the chlorine system, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling.\n* Mechanical integrity measures involving routine inspection and testing of the equipment and regularly scheduled maintenance.\n* Incident investigation with 48 hours of any incident or near misses in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe above measures are only part of OCU's aggressive safety program.  In addition to the PSM program, other OSHA programs have been developed such as hot work permitting and confined space entry.  These programs are designed to protect OCU and contractor employees.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program covers all aspects or emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for post-evacuation employee accounting, notification procedures, rescue and medical duties, and response procedures for spills and leaks.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn addition to the PSM/RMP program measures summarized above, OCU has boistered its security measures following a vulnerability analysis conducted in compliance with the new federal rules for Homeland Security.  These measures will ensure a greater safety against accidental releases as well as improved safety for onsite workers."
