The process in these engine rooms has a total capacity of over 10,000lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n     The places where most leaks or releases of ammonia will occur are in the engine.  However all of the connections, valves and gauges have a potential for leaks or ruptures. Most leaks or ruptures will be small and easily fixed by one of Blue Star Growers qualified refrigeration employees.  The most common causes of releases are operations and maintenance failures, equipment failures, and process failures.  These are the three leading causes of accidental releases of ammonia.\n     When there is an accidental release and no one is on the premise, this would be handled by the computer.  The computer checks all areas where ammonia could possibly be.  When the computer finds ammonia it turns on the alarm, shuts off the King Valve and dials emergency numbers for all refrigeration employees.  The employees in turn come down to the warehouse and fix the leak and shut of the alarm.\n     Because of this, Blue Star Growers makes daily inspections of the process to determine if there are any potential problems.\n     Blue Star Growers has been in business since the early 1950's and has had ammonia refrigeration all of that time with no release of more than 100 pounds that affected any on-site or off-site area.\n     The check for accidental release of ammonia is an on-going operation.  It is preformed on a daily basis.  Each Blue Star Growers refrigeration employee is responsible for the examining of each piece of the process that is located in the engine rooms and the piping that takes the ammonia from the engine room to each CA or common storage room.  Inspections are made seven days a week and repairs to minor leaks are corrected as they are identified.\n     If there is an accidental release of ammonia from"
