Hronis, Inc. is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its community.  The Hronis, Inc. staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards. The Ammonia Refrigeration Systems, that contain the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, are used for freezer and cooler operation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Hronis, Inc. to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Hronis, Inc. trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  The Hronis, Inc. Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its PSM/RMP Program.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Hronis, Inc. will contact the Kern County Fire Department to respond.  A designated emergency contact for the plant initiates emergency notifications.  All employees are trained in the proper procedures and their appropriate role in the event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System No. 1 at the Hronis, Inc. facility is comprised of five compressors, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver, one suction accumulator and liquid transfer vessel, and multiple flooded evaporators and their associated accumulators.

      "SummaryText": "d of two compressors, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver, one suction accumulator and liquid transfer vessel and multiple flooded evaporators and their associated accumulators.  The Ammonia Refrigeration Systems contain anhydrous ammonia that continuously circulates through the system.  Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the systems provides the needed cooling effect.  In addition, as an added safety feature, the relief valves of each system are vented to their designated diffusion tank in order to minimize the potential for atmospheric releases of ammonia. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHronis, Inc. has implemented a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) program to manage the safety aspects of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements. The management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.  The RMP and PSM Program also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents at the Hronis, Inc. facility where ammonia has been released to the atmosphere due to the operation of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems in the past five years (August 2008 to August 2013). \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral process and management system"
