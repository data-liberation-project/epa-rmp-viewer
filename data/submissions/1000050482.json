(1) Hansen Auto Purger\n\n?    (1) Machinery Room Ventilation System\n\n?    (1) Ammonia Diffusion Tank\n\n\n\nThe Conditioning and Cold Storage Systems operate as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator in the engine room. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nProcess 3 operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a liquid feed solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  "

As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 was built in 2012 by Ross & Sons. The original construction included the Conditioning and Cold Storage Systems. In 2015, American Incorporated was hired to design and install the refrigeration equipment for Process 3.\n\n\n\nIn general, Wonderful Citrus D2 refrigeration equipment was designed and installed by licensed contractors in accordance with industry standards at the time of construction. Each system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Each entrance to a machinery room contains emergency refrigeration shutdown and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\n\nEach ammonia system at Wonderful Citrus D2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. The systems are not connected to each other, nor co-located such that a release from one system would impact the ability to operate the other systems. As such, Wonderful Citrus D2 has three (3) refrigeration processes.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in a"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Wonderful Citrus D2 facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 92,600 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n- California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n- Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has developed a Hazmat Technician Emergency "

Nevertheless, Wonderful Citrus D2 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Wonderful Citrus D2' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Wonderful Citrus D2' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wonderful Citrus D2 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Wonderful Citrus D2 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Wonderful Citrus D2 employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
