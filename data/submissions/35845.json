      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThe Duron Paints & Wallcoverings (Duron) facility located on 10406 Tucker Street in Beltsville, Maryland operates an aerosol canister warehousing process covered by the RMP regulations.\n\nAerosol canisters containing the propellants propane, butane, and isobutane are stored in the Sundries warehouse at the Duron facility.  The maximum capacity of the warehouse space at the facility is 55,000 aerosol canisters, each containing up to 14 ounces of material.  The aerosol canisters contain approximately 20 to 30 percent propellants.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.115 (b) (2), for purposes of calculating the TQ of the flammable propellants on-site, the entire 14 ounces of material is assumed to be flammable propellant because each aerosol canister contains greater than 1 percent of each propellant.  Therefore, Duron exceeds the TQ of propane, butane, and isobutane of 10,000 pounds per compound.  The warehousing operation is therefore a regulated process covered under the RMP regulations.\n\nThere have been no accidents at the facility within the past five years (21 June 1999 through 21 June 2004, the 5-year period prior to the resubmittal of the RMP to the USEPA) that meet the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nTo ensure that all components of accidental release management are covered in the RMP, a facility is also required to address emergency response planning.  RMP requires that a Program 1 facility coordinate with local responders to ensure they are prepared to respond to an incident at the facility and establish an appropriate mechanism for notification of the emergency responders when response is needed. \n\nThe current Emergency Response Plan for the facility has been in use since 01 November 2001.  The Prince George?s County Beltsville Station Fire Department will respond to emergencies at the facility.  Fire department personnel visit the Duron facility annually in preparation for a response to emergency.  All the appropriate emergency contacts for any give"
