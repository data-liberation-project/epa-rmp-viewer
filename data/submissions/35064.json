      "SummaryText": "The Hutchinson Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed this Risk Management Plan because of the amount of chlorine that is kept on-site.  Chlorine is used in one-ton cylinders and up to four cylinders may be present on site at any time.  A Risk Management Plan is required by EPA rules (40 CFR 68) when a facility stores greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine at any one time.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility operates and maintains the chlorination system under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which was developed to comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program is designed to operate and maintain the system and the equipment in a manner that will reduce the possibility of a chlorine release.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, the facility has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Hutchinson Fire Department."
