This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Orchard facility is prepared to work with the Elkhorn County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\n\nThe Orchard facility's primary covered process activity is the mixing of fertilizers.  These activities include storage and processing of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor. The T reactor is usually a contractor operation that is controlled by the contractor.   Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The Emergency Response Procedures for Orchard are coordinated with the Elkhorn County LEPC.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. ? Orchard, Ne has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Orchard is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The unit maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures are maintained for covered process operations.  These procedures address the following activities:   initial startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.\n\nTrain"
