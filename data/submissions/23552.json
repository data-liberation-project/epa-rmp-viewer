Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow\") is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Dow is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activity at Dow's Pittsburg site is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Dow has six regulated substances present at the Pittsburg site.  These substances include 1,3-butadiene, ammonia (aqueous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  1,3-butadiene is used in making emulsion polymers.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making emulsion polymers and an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used for water treatment and in making intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, Dow has used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses Dow has used PHAST 5.01.  The following paragraphs provide d"

In a worst case scenario, 180,000 lb. of chlorine would be released from a rail tank car.  The liquid chlorine released would be assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation would take place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is calculated corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nAn alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) would involve an unlikely release from 310 Block and Associated Operations.  The scenario would involve the release of 1,821 lb. from a rupture of an unloading hose at the rail tank car unloading station.  Liquid sulfur dioxide would be assumed to be released to atmosphere over a period of 1 minute. It is assumed that the release would be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s). These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the amount released, the duration of the release, and the consequences of a release.

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 4, 2001. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Dow.  The most recent review was performed on May 22, 2001.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDow conducts audits of compliance systems on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on November 2, 2000.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDow promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDow truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  The site has safety teams, which involve employees as leaders in facilitating team efforts. In addition, Dow employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at Dow's Pittsburg site.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, Dow hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Dow has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform Dow of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nDow has enjoyed an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to Dow's stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to rates lower than the overall chemical manufacturing industry.\n\nThere have been 3 accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from the Dow site within the last 5 years.  The first release took place on June 21, 1996 and involved less than 1 lb. of hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous).  No offsite deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this accident.

No offsite deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there was one minor injury.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nDow utilizes a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, Dow emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within Dow's processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCA Region II LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Dow Pittsburg site has been coordinated and verified. Dow also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Dow with additional emergency response capability.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of Dow's accidental release prevention program.  Development of the Environmental, Health and Safety Work Process along with our Environmental, Health and Safety 2005 company-wide goals are some of the major steps Dow has taken to improve safety at the Pittsburg site. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate options for reducing the duration of accidental releases that may occur, and to improve our crisis response training and procedures.\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company        Pittsburg, Califo"
