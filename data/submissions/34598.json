Messerly WWTP), owned by Augusta Utilities and operated by Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI).\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nOMI believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment. Accordingly, OMI has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation, management leadership and support. This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the J. B. Messerly WWTP RMP for the chlorine system. OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine storage and chlorination process at the J. B. Messerly WWTP and therefore, has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements. By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule, its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine. If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur. Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nOMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the chlorine at the J. B. Messerly WWTP and actively participate in process hazard anal"

      "SummaryText": "yses. The chlorine storage and chlorination process has not changed since the time of the first RMP submission in June 1999. The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of the chlorine storage and chlorination system. Refresher training is provided to the employees at least once every three years. They are aided in this work by complete and understandable system operating procedures.\n\nOMI management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in the J. B. Messerly WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\n\nAs for emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and updated as changes in staffing occur.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe J. B. Messerly WWTP is located Richmond County, Georgia. The 46-MGD J. B. Messerly WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations. Incoming wastewater initially passes through automated bar screens before being treated. The plant utilizes primary clarification, activated sludge aeration, secondary clarification and disinfection. Final effluent is disinfected by chlorination prior to discharge to a wetland. Solids are digested anaerobically and dewatered prior to land application.\n\nThe J. B. Messerly WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater. The chlorine is stored in eighteen 1-ton containers of which six are on-line, six are full and on standby, and the remaining are normally empty. Although the maximum storage capacity is 36,000 pounds, normally 24,000 pounds of chlorine are stored and used in twelve 1-ton containers. Therefore, the J. B. Messerly WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the fa"

The hot work procedures were reviewed in June 2004.\n3.12  Contractor management program, to ensure appropriate evaluation and selection of qualified contractors for work on or near the chlorine system, proper notification of contractors regarding known chlorine system hazards and the J. B. Messerly WWTP emergency evacuation plan, limited access to the chlorine process, and evaluation of contractor performance.\n\nIn addition to these elements, the chlorine storage area of the J. B. Messerly WWTP is equipped with a chlorine leak detector that continuously monitors the air for chlorine gas. If the chlorine sensor detects a specified level, audio and visual alarms will be activated and a high rate ventilation system can be activated. The ventilation system withdraws chlorine and air from a low elevation in the chlorine storage room to a safe outdoor location. The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a chlorine release. Management of Change procedures will be used for the upgrades to the chlorine system.\n\n4.0  Accident History\n\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this updated RMP, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n5.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Richmond County LEPC.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the J. B. Messerly WWTP RMP manual. The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n3.1  Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment.\n3.2  Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. PHA was revalidated in June 2004. \n3.3  Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures were reviewed in December 2003.\n3.4  Training for each J. B. Messerly WWTP employee involved in operating the chlorine system.

The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\n6.0  Planned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee participation meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the J. B. Messerly WWTP. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the J. B. Messerly WWTP program, process hazard analyses were revalidated with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements. As the equipment and the process has remained the same from the time the first PHA was performed in 1999, the PHA review/revalidation conducted in June 2004 did not result in any new findings or recommendations. The recommendations from the PHA conducted in 1999 and the findings of the compliance audit conducted in May 2002 were reviewed for completion; a few recommendations are scheduled to be completed by September 2004."
