Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program \u0096 Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) \u0096 Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \u0093living document\u0094. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, TGC Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 TGC Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that TGC Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                    | Process Chemical                    | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia               41,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligatio"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n(9) Rooms\n(4) Precool rooms\n(5) Hallways\n(2) Liquid recirculators\n(1) Palletize room\n(1) Hydro-cooler\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nTGC Cold Storage is located at 16350 Driver Rd, Bakersfield, CA 93308. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.495230, -119.469466. The facility is located immediately west of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \u0093a special flood hazard area\u0094. The elevation of the machinery room was designed with the flood hazards in mind.\n\nTGC Cold Storage is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that faults within close proximity are not considered high risk:\nNew Hope fault - <150 Years\nPremier fault - <150 Years\nNew Hope fault - <1,600,000 Years\nPoso Creek fault - <1,600,000 Years\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that TGC Cold Storage had a 2-5% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\nThe evaporators in the Hydrocooler and Precool Rooms are supplied from flooded accumulators while air-cooling evaporators in Rooms 1-9  and the hallways are supplied by recirculators.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nTGC Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the TGC Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nTGC Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nTGC Cold Storage\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\nCalifornia \u0093Emergency Action Plan\u0094 \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\nFederal \u0093Emergency Action Plan\u0094 - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \nCalifornia \u0093Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\u0094 (HAZWOPER) \u0096 Title 8 CCR Title 8 \u00a75192(q)\nFederal \u0093Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\u0094 (HAZWOPER) \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\n\nStrategically, we will"

All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTGC Cold Storage has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, TGC Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved TGC Cold Storage\u0092s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that TGC Cold Storage\u0092s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nTGC Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, TGC Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, TGC Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for TGC Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the"
