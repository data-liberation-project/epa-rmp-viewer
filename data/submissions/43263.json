      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Airgas Specialty Products Inc.'s Jeffersonville, IN Distribution Center\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. is committed to compliance with all laws and regulations, the safety of employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive ammonia release prevention program that includes areas such as system design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, security and a comprehensive employee training program associated with all ammonia processes. Airgas Specialty Products policy is for all facilities to meet ANSI K61.1 standards for \"Safety Requirements for The Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Company policy also requires the implementation of appropriate controls to prevent releases of ammonia to the atmosphere. Airgas Specialty Products strives to prevent emergency situations, but maintains a current Emergency Action Plan to be prepared should an emergency situation develop.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary business at the subject facility is the Distribution of Anhydrous and Aqueous Ammonia. Ammonia is not produced at the subject facility; rather it is received via rail as a liquefied compressed gas. Ammonia is stored in ASME code pressure vessels and the storage and handling system meets OSHA, EPA and ANSI K61.1 requirements. Very little ammonia is released to the atmosphere at this facility. Ammonia storage and transfer operations are accomplished in totally enclosed pressure systems designed to meet all code requirements.\n\nPart of the anhydrous ammonia received at the facility is converted into aqueous ammonia solution (19.5% ammonia and 29.5% ammonia in water) on site. The aqua ammonia operation and storage is also a totally enclosed system.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Jeffersonville, IN  facility is 650,000 lb. while the m"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has implemented the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 and Process Safety Management requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119. All LaRoche facilities are constructed and operated in accord with AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA (ANSI K61.1). The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the subject facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. maintains a detailed file of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all pertinent operations.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. conducts comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis studies to ensure that hazards associated with its operations are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at intervals no less frequently than required by regulations (5-yr intervals), and even more frequently if needed. Conclusions and recommendations of the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. develops and maintains written operating procedures (SOPs) for all phases of ammonia related operations. These procedures address all modes of operation including, but not limited to, initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and maintenance procedures. The procedures are reviewed annually and are readily available to all operators involved in the"
