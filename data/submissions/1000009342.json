      "SummaryText": "Boehringer Ingelheim Chemicals, Inc. (B.I. Chemicals) owns and operates a pharmaceutical production facility that is located in the Petersburg, Virginia Industrial Park.  The facility operates on a continious basis, with the majority of the personnel on-site during the day shift (0730 - 1600 hours) and a smaller on-site population on the off-shifts.  The processes that are utilized on-site are batch type chemical reactors to produce a wide variety of pharmaceuticals.  These operations are closely monitored/audited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).                                                                                                                      The site operations in general are not regulated under the requirements of the Risk Management Program, however, one chemical involved in the production of selected pharmaceuticals are maintained at the facility at or above the regulated thresholds.  The chemical is Ammonium Hydroxide (ammonia concentration of 29%).    A review of the production operations and regulated chemicals have led to the development of worst case scenarios for potential releases, that could affect the environment and/or off-site personnel.  The worse case scenario release of Ammonium Hydroxide (ammonia concentration of 29%) would result from the rupture of the Ammonium Hydroxide storage tank.  The liquid would be contained on site, releasing to the floor of the Warehouse, but could produce a vapor cloud.  Both scenarios are considered unlikely; however, the plant has developed a working Emergency Response Plan with the Petersburg Fire Department to respond to an emergency.  In addition, on-site personnel have received specific training on handling these emergencies.
