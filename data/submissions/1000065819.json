Mechanical Integrity documents how the facility is designed, constructed, inspected and maintained.  Management of Change documents technical aspects, materials and codes.

Hot Work Permits are issued to insure that all hot work is safely performed in any area where there may be safety considerations.  Contractor Safety is documented.  The contractor working at the facility must be qualified and trained to perform his job duties.  In addition, the facility must inform the contractor about hazards unique to the plant and also what to do in plant emergencies.  A Pre-Start-up Safety Review is necessary for new systems or systems where there is a change to process inventory.  Any Trade Secrets are identified.  Finally a Compliance Audit is conducted every 3 years. This audit reviews each section of our prevention program.  A follow up report details recommendations made to improve the program.\r\nFollowing program guidelines a Worse Case release of ammonia and an alternative Worse Case release is considered and a report developed.  This Hazard Assessment is useful in the development of our Emergency Response Plan and the model generated in this report would be useful in an actual release.\r\n \r\nFive year Accident History: \r\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  A record of incidents is kept.  An incident investigation is performed to determine the cause of each incident and to develop recommendations to prevent a re-occurrence.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan: \r\nTrident Seafoods Akutan, Alaska facility has a written Emergency Response Plan that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including"
