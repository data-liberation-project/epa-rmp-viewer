This plant is one of two sites that Clean Harbors operates in the Deer Park Area.  Clean Harbors has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to TSD plant.  Only the 2027 Independence Parkway South Plant operations and policies are presented in this RMP*eSubmit Plan.\r\n\r\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\r\nThe Clean Harbors Deer Park Plant accidental release prevention policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, equipment, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Act's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program, (PSM) 29 CFR-1910-119, of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The OSHA program is similar to the EPA's RMP prevention program and EPA emergency response program.\r\nClean Harbors provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and RMP safety and prevention programs as outlined in our Employee Participation policy and procedure.  Clean Harbors also provides a variety of technical documents beyond the RMP and PSM-required policies and procedures.   The documents are used to maintain safe operation of the processes and include chemical handling instructions. \r\n1.1.\tPREDICTIVE FILING (A) (1)\r\nThe plant is a treatment storage and disposal site that uses incineration for treatment (destruction) of the hazardous waste streams we are permitted to treat.  Because of the nature of this operation we use predictive filing since there is"

An evaluation of all the PSM and RMP chemicals on site is determined on a daily basis. The daily evaluation is a conservative estimate of the quantity of each chemical.  It's based on the maximum amount of that chemical in each waste stream.  Cooperating local response agencies are informed of the complete predictive RMP list and upon request, the actual facility inventories are provided.  \r\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\r\nClean Harbors has a management system in place which is led by the plant General Manager.  The Clean Harbors Safety Manager and Compliance Manager oversee the execution and on-going implementation of the RMP as well as the like PSM elements.  This program, along with other plant-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information and a copy is attached to this RMP*eSubmital.\r\n1.3.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\r\nClean Harbors maintains policies, procedures, systems and staff that are an integral part of our prevention program.  These are applied to each process in our plant operations.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained by the Clean Harbors Treatment Plant Document Management System (DMS).\r\n\r\n2.\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED (B)  \r\nClean Harbors operates a treatment storage and disposal hazardous waste incinerator system for the destruction of liquid and solid waste products."

The location is 2027 Independence Parkway South, La Porte, Harris County, Texas 77571.  The location of one of the tank truck chemical off-loading operations within the plant is Lat 29.731303, Long -95.095424 and our EPA ID number is: 100000059107.\r\nThe boundaries of the highly hazardous chemical system subject to the RMP regulation include the bulk rail car off-loading area, the tank truck off-loading area; both are adjacent to the tank farm used to store these chemicals.  There is also a bulk direct burn area that can handle several tank truck trailers at a time as well as three Glove Box areas use to direct burn drums, cylinders, and tote bins of various hazardous chemicals.  The plant also has a large warehouse area for storage of containerized hazardous chemicals.  Standard containers vary from lab pack items, one, five, 30, 55 gallon drums and tote bins up to 320 gallon in .  The final boundary of the RMP process is when the material is oxidized in the various combustion chambers of or incineration systems.  All of the systems are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP PSI files.  Feeding of the kiln is directed by the operations group from a central control room located between the bulk liquid storage area and the kiln feed areas. \r\n2.1.1.\tRegulated substance (b) (2)\r\nHighly hazardous chemicals including both flammable and toxics may be on site that exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule's threshold quantities.  The TSD operates under permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  Hazardous waste streams include highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) that are received, stored and disposed of by incineration in Clean Harbors kiln treatment process systems. \r\nHighly hazardous chemicals are EPA-listed toxic or flammable chemi"

The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".

The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the highly hazardous chemical released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA specified endpoint for highly hazardous chemical is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).
