      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSpire Storage West - Clear Creek Plant (Clear Creek)\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nSpire has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nSpire's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. Clear Creek has coordinated with the Evanston City Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nClear Creek is located approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming.\n\n\n\nClear Creek is a gas storage facility. Gas may be delivered to or received from Questar Pipeline, Northwest Pipeline, Overthrust Pipeline or Kern River Pipeline. Two Caterpillar 3608 engines coupled with JDG-4 compressors provide both injection and withdrawal compression services. The compressors are designed for single or two stage operation.\n\n\n\nWhen set to the injection mode, the capacity of the facility is 35MMCF/D. Gas is received from the pipeline or pipelines and sent to one or both compressors. After two stage compression the gas is delivered to one or both of the injection/withdrawal wells for storage. (44-4B and 35-4B) When set to the withdrawal mode, the capacity of the facility is 50 MMCF/D. Gas is received from the storage wells and enters an inlet separator through the Inlet Heater and Choke. Free water and condensate are separated from the gas stream. The water is injected into a water disposal well (32-9B) located adjacent to the site. The condensate is sent to the condensate flash tank where vapors are collected by the overhead compressor and re-circulated"

      "SummaryText": ". The liquid condensate is then sent to one of two 400bbl atmospheric storage tanks for sale by truck. The gas stream then enters the 50MMCF/D JT Plant that provides hydrocarbon and water dewpoint control. Ethylene glycol is injected into the inlet gas, or tube side of the Gas to Gas Exchanger to absorb water from the gas stream. The glycol is separated in the Cold Separator and returned to the Glycol Reboiler for regeneration. The Glycol Reboiler also provides heat for the NGL Reboiler via pumps that circulate hot glycol through the Stabilizer Reboiler.\n\n\n\nNGL liquids are produced as a result of chilling the gas through a combination of the Gas to Gas exchanger and the JT Valve. NGL is dumped from the Cold Separator to the Stabilizer Tower, where is comes into contact with the Stabilizer Reboiler. Lighter vapors are sent through an overhead/NGL Heat Exchanger and collected by the Overhead Compressor and re-circulated. The NGL is sent through a fan operated NGL Air Cooler and then through the Overhead/NGL Heat Exchanger and then to the 50,000 gallon pressurized storage tank for sale by truck.\n\n\n\nThe gas stream exits the Cold Separator and enters the shell side of the Gas to Gas exchanger, then continues on to the Compressor Suction Header. After single stage compression, the gas is delivered to one or any combination of the connected pipelines. If market conditions require, Clear Creek was designed to be able to take delivery from a pipeline and simultaneously inject a portion of the gas and redeliver the remaining volume to another pipeline.\n\n\n\nClear Creek is equipped with a flare to combust emissions from  the various tank vents and other low- pressure vents in the plant as well as emissions from the PSV vents and various other high- pressure vents in the facility.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nCLEAR CREEK SAFETY GUIDELINES \n\n\n\n- Weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, fighting, horseplay and gambling are s"

This includes all buildings and vehicles inside the fence.\n\n\n\n- For any contract company to be able to work at this Spire facility, they must first appear on our GA for Clear Creek. No work may begin without verification of this listing.\n\n\n\n- Location - We must also maintain controlled access to the plant both for security reasons, and so we know exactly where you are in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n- Hot work permit - Contractor vehicles are required to obtain a hot work permit when they are inside of facility buildings or within designated hot work areas.  Contractors must stop at the control room and obtain this permit prior to entry. The plant is divided into classified (Hazardous) and unclassified areas depending on the potential presence of sources of combustion. Before any work begins that requires open flames or has the potential for causing sparks or extreme heat in a classified area, a Hot Work Permit must be obtained. This permit requires answering several questions pertaining to eliminating potential hazards and also includes a thorough check of the area with a combustible gas monitor.  This insures that all sources of combustion have been identified and eliminated. If you need a Hot Work Permit or have any questions as to whether or not the work you will be doing requires one, please check with the operator on duty in the control room.\n\n\n\n- Sign-in sheet - All persons must sign in at the control room upon entering the facility and sign out before exiting.\n\n\n\n- Safety clothing - A hardhat, safety glasses, Flame Resistant Clothing w/ long sleeves, and steel- toed shoes are required as minimum protection. When needed, rubber gloves, goggles, face shields, are available on location. Certain areas of the plant require that hearing protection be worn due to excessive noise levels. These areas are well posted, and dispensers for hearing protection can be found at each on"

If at any time you have questions concerning safety or your work assignment, you may ask any Spire employee for assistance.\n\n\n\n- Safety Data Sheets (SDS) - Safety Data Sheets or SDS's are located in a binder kept in control room and are available to view. \n\n\n\n- Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) - LOTO must be used when working on electrical or mechanical devices or anything with the potential for a release of energy.\n\n\n\n- Ladders/step-ladders - Visually inspect your ladder before use. Do not use the top platform as a step. Be sure the ladder is set up on solid ground before use.  If the job requires working at a height in excess of 6 feet, you must also wear a safety harness and a lifeline. If the ladders being used belong to the plant, they must be returned to the storage area upon completion of the project.\n\n\n\n- Tripping hazards - From time to time laying extension cords, air & water hoses, tubing lines and piping across walkways are unavoidable. Try to minimize tripping hazards by not laying any more than needed across a known walkway and by taping down cords and hoses. Safety cones may also be used to aid in employee awareness and prevent accidents.\n\n\n\n- Confined space entry - You may not enter any vessel or any excavation exceeding 4 feet in depth without a Confined Space Entry Permit. The use and issuance of this permit will be explained in the pre-job safety meeting by plant personnel as the need arises.\n\n\n\n- Identifying hazards - A potential hazard must be encircled with caution tape, marked with safety cones, posted with signs, or a combination of all three to ensure that the hazard is easily identifiable.
