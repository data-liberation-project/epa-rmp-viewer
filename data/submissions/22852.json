All existing operating procedures related to anhydrous ammonia are verified for correctness once a year by the production manager, plant supervisor and process operator.\n\nTraining is formulated and tracked by the plant manager, general counsel and health & safety manager.  Understanding of the training is assured by oral exams and demonstration.\n\nThe mechanical integrity of the system is delegated to the maintenance manager.  The program consists of equipment lists and specifications,  preventative maintenance procedures and a demand work order system. \n\nThe management of change program is quality assured by the plant manager, maintenance manager and general counsel.  It is composed of a written program with elements delegated to appropriate members of the management team.\n\nThere is a written prestartup review program quality assured by the maintenance manager or his delegate.\n\nThe incident investigation  program follows corporate policy for fact determination, root cause system analysis and recommendation implementation. \n\nThe corporate policy is to hold periodic safety meetings at which employee participation is encouraged concerning each element of the program as well as general plant-wide safety and production issues.\n\nThe contractor program follows a corporate contractor policy.  The program is implemented by the Health and Safety Manager.\n\nNo accidental releses of anhydrous ammonia has occured at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe worst case toxic release of anhydrous ammonia is 1.24 miles by use of the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS) model.\n\nThe alternative case release of anyhydro"
