      "SummaryText": "Superior Deshler Inc. receives, stores and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia at the facility located in Superior Nebraska.  The maximum storage quanity of Anhydrous is 140,196 lbs.  The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.  Worst Case Scenario - A maximum of 140,196 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min into the urban area surrounding the plant up to 1.10 miles to endpoint.  The offsite consequences could include approximately 1500 people, including residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas and commercial industrial facilities.\nAlternative Release Scenario - A transfer hose failure of Anhydrous Ammonia has the potential to release 26,638 lbs. of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min in the urban area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  The offsite consequences could include approximately 780 people.  The effected population would include residential, school, hospital, recreation areas and commercial industrial occupants.\nThe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the environment.  The facility has had no such release in the past 5 years.  Complying with safety standards for the storage and handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia and completing regular maintenance on the equipment at the facility will continue to prevent any accidental releases at the Superior Deshler Inc. plant at Superior Nebraska."
