This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nPlymouth has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans have annual training requirements (at a minimum) to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  All new employees are required to attend orientation where the Plans listed above are reviewed.  New employees also undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nPlymouth's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nPlymouth is located in Merrill, Plymouth County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substance stored at the facility is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (also referred to as denaturant).  \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst-case Scenarios:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 63,415-gallon tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structur"

The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation.  The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 370,344 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The entire contents of the tank are reportable under CAA Section 112(r).   RMP*Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (0.6 mile), the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using MARPLOT and EJSCREEN census reports.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant.\n\nAlternate Scenarios:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 9,400 gallons (54,857 pounds) of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a pool fire.   The endpoint used was the distance to the heat radiation endpoint of 5 kW/square meter.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.  For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint (0.2 mile), the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation. The entire tanker contents, equaling 9,400 gallons (54,857 pounds) of the flammable mixture was used in the RMP*Comp model.  Public receptor information was obtained using MARPLOT and EJSCREEN census reports.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant."

A PSM program has been implemented at the facility covering the flammable mixture.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nPlymouth's maintenance staff performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations.  Monthly and quarterly visual inspections are performed and documented, records are maintained on site.  Quarterly Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) monitoring is performed and reports filed per State and Federal regulations.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving RMP-reportable substances.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nPlymouth has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Emergency Action Plan the details evacuation and response procedures for spills and releases, fire, etc.  The plans listed in this section have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nPlymouth provides safety training to its employees on an annual basis.  Contractors are trained on plant-specific safety procedures prior to initiating work onsite.  Any changes to improve safety will be implemented immediately upon discovery of needed changes."
