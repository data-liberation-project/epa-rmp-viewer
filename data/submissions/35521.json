Each level of management is directly responsible for the implementation of the Corporate Accident Prevention Program and responsible for the safety performance of their employees.  An active safety management team comprises of members from all departments participates in process hazard analysis, process safety management review, incident review, and safety implementation review.

The Georgetown Fire Department serves as the company\u00bfs first responders in case of any emergency beyond the control or expertise of DynaChem personnel.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDynaChem Inc. is a chemical manufacturing plant supplying foundry chemicals and other resins.  The DynaChem plant in Georgetown, Illinois is located in a rural, sparsely populated section of Vermilion County.  The plant uses two listed toxic chemicals above threshold quantities.  Epichlorohydrin is stored and used in the production of epoxy resins.  In another area of the facility, formaldehyde solution is stored for use in the production of phenolic resins.\n\n3.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDynaChem Inc. has safety, quality control, and risk management programs that assure effective operator training and mandate a preventative maintenance program.

The Georgetown Fire Department conducts annual HazMat response drills at the DynaChem facility with emphasis on both toxic and flammable chemical hazards.  Emergency response is coordinated with the Georgetown Fire Department and the Vermilion County Emergency Planning Committee.  A written Emergency Response Plan is provided to these emergency response organizations.  Both emergency response and emergency medical procedures are documented and are emphasized during emergency response training on-site.  Contracted spill response units handle spills that exceed those associated with normal operations and maintenance activities.  DynaChem is continually evaluating the hazards of operation and proceeding to fully integrate OSHA, EPA, and State of Illinois requirements for on-site chemical manufacturing."
