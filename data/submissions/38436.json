Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nWhiting Petroleum's Stoney Point Gas Plant (SPGP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nII.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nStoney Point Gas Plant, located near Jonesville, Michigan, operates processes to remove liquids from natural gas.  The plant has a single regulated flammable mixture, which contains ethane, butane, propane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances. \n\nIII.  General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBecause the SPGP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The accident prevention program in place at SPGP is summarized in the following:\n\n? Employee Participation: the SPGP ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of process safety management and accident prevention. \n\n? Process Safety Information: The SPGP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n? Training:  To complement the written pro"

      "SummaryText": "cedures for process operations, the SPGP has implemented a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program, is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process. \n\n? Contractors:  The SPGP uses skilled contractors that are supervised by agents of the company that have appropriate training to assure the work they are overseeing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety of company and contract personnel and the general public.  \n\n? Safe Work Practices:  The SPGP has long standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. \n\n\nThe processes at the SPGP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The SPGP has safety features in many areas to help quickly detect a release and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The SPGP uses release detection systems such as flame detectors and H2S detectors in critical areas, and release mitigation measures such as dikes to contain liquid releases.\n\nIV.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe SPGP has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nV.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe SPGP has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan for worker safety.  SPGP is a defensive responder to accidental spills of NGL.  Upon detection of a spill, emergency responders are summoned by calling 911.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on factors such as modification made to the plant process or operating procedures, or change in the communication procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program for the SPGP is coordinated with the Hillsdale County local emergency planning committee (LEPC), which consists of local emerg"

      "SummaryText": "ency response officials, state and local government officials, and industry representatives.  The SPGP has around-the-clock communication capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to meetings with the LEPC, the SPGP conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\nVI.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSPGP strives to improve the safety of its operation continually.  A Process Hazards Analysis was conducted in February of 2003, and all action items have been scheduled for resolution."
