If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to human health and the environment.  A detailed response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  \n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizer.  The substance occasionally stored at this facility above the RMP threshold is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received via rail car and reacts with phosphoric acid to produce ammonia polyphosphate fertilizer.  The end product is nonhazardous.  The fertilizer is utilized in land application for crop production.  The mobile reactor used in this process is not the property of UAP Distribution, Inc.  The reactor is owned by a private companythat travels to various locationproviding the service to retail fertilizer locations.  No employee of UAP Distribution is involved in the processing.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has developed a written Emergency Response Plan.  The Plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated by OSHA, DOT/RSPA, and EPA.  The plan addresses actions to be taken in various emergency situation.  The plan includes emergency contact information (both internal and external),  arrangements with local authorities, emergency action procedures, fire preventions, the spill policy, the closure plan, and more.  The plan also include employee training.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe users of anhydrous ammonia at the facility implement the provisions of the following:\n     Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia - ANSI K61"
