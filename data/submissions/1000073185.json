The facility operates under a current Risk Management Plan which details both the dangers associated with using sulfur dioxide and the precautions implemented to ensure the safe use of sulfur dioxide in the de-chlorination process of treating the wastewater for discharge. Precautions include routine inspection of the equipment, proper stock of emergency response and personal protection equipment, and training of facility personnel on proper operating and emergency response procedures. The most probable type of release may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the sulfur dioxide lines. AWU has trained a number of workers who know how to use emergency equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and other personal protective equipment to repair such leaks. AWU keeps a B kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on operational leaks. The RMP includes current standard operating procedures for preventative maintenance on the de-chlorination system.\r\n\r\nAny Emergency Response is to be done in conjunction with the Austin Fire Department. All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the likely types of leaks are available on site. Further, AWU personnel audit the facility to maintain the integrity of emergency equipment, communication systems and the training status of its employees. Austin Water Utility has worked with the local emergency responders such as the Fire Department, their HazMat group, the local police departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that all parties are aware of the emergency response plan and know what to do in the event of an accidental release of sulfur dioxide."

      "SummaryText": "SOUTH AUSTIN REGIONAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\r\nCITY OF AUSTIN WATER UTILITY\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP), EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe South Austin Regional Waste Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Austin, Texas and operated by Austin Water Utility. The location of the facility is 1017 Fallwell Lane, Del Valle, Texas 78617 in Travis County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act 112(r). The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 40.000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in twenty (20) one ton cylinders. The facility utilizes 5 cylinders in-service and 5 cylinders stand-by with automatic transfer as the cylinders become empty. Once the cylinders are empty the lines are disconnected and connected to 5 full containers. The facility maintains 10 cylinders in storage and orders sulfur dioxide, as necessary, for delivery of new cylinders and removal of empty cylinders. Sulfur dioxide, used in the de-chlorination process, is the only chemical stored on-sight which is regulated under the Risk Management Plan regulations. The facility previously listed chlorine as a regulated substance; however, after a release incident in 2011 it was determined to remove chlorine gas liquefied under pressure from the chlorination process and replace it with a 12.5% chlorine solution which is not regulated. There have been no other incidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at the facility.  \r\n\r\nThe South Austin Regional Waste Water Treatment Plant maintains a Risk Management Plan containing all of the elements required for a program 2 facility under the Clean Air Act section 112(r) regulations. The plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the potential hazard zone under both the Worst Case Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario. These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario that would require either evacuation of the area or have the residents"
