      "SummaryText": "We at the City of Toccoa Water and Wastewater Utility are strongly committed to employee public and environmental safety.  Chlorine gas is used for disinfection purposes in the treatment of potable water and is the only regulated substance stored and used at the facility. The facility treats an average of 3.80 million gallons per day (MGD).\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at the Toccoa Water Treatment Facility (WTF) is 14,000 pounds (lbs) or seven 2,000 lb cylinders. \nChlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres [99.89 pounds per square inch (psi)].  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).  \nThe chlorine cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that is designed to fail if the temperature of the reaches above 158 degrees F (Fahrenheit).  The purpose of the fusible plug is to prevent cylinder failure in the event of an extended, hot fire by allowing controlled release of cylinder contents.    \nAccident History:   A review of the accident history since 1998 indicated that there have been no accidental releases from the Chlorine System that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.                                                                          Management System:  The City of Toccoa has a management system for the Water Treatment Facility specifically designed to address the safe operation of the facility. Management commitment to process safety is a high priority for the City and a critical element of our risk management program. Process safety information is maintained at the "

      "SummaryText": "Toccoa WTF.   \n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis is updated every 5 years or whenever a major change to the system occurs.  Major changes in the system are expected to be rare, but an analysis of safety issues will be evaluated whenever changes related to the chlorination system occur. Update was completed in June 2004 and 2009.                                                                                            The intent of the facility training programs is to ensure that plant staff are provided with the necessary information to safely perform their job responsibilities related to the chlorination system.  Initial training for all newly hired employees is conducted in all procedures. Training will be provided by the chief operator. Preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing of chlorination equipment are critical to the safe operation of the WTF.                                                                                             Preventive maintenance is conducted annually on the chlorination equipment.   Documentation is maintained. In addition, inspections and maintenance are conducted on the monorail crane and hoist system and documentation is maintained.   At least every 3 years the staff of the WTF conduct a compliance audit of the chlorination system. The audit is conducted by the facility chief operator as well as other personnel knowledgeable in the operation of the chlorination system.        \nEach incident, which results in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of chlorine in the workplace is investigated. An investigation is initiated immediately (within 24 hours) upon notification of the incident. An investigation team is established and a report prepared.\nTrained personnel at Toccoa WTF would attempt to control a release within their capability.  However, in the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, personnel would notify the Fire Department immediately. \nThe Toccoa WTF RMP outlines procedures for "
