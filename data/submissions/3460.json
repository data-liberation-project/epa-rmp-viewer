      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn the United Watre Conservation District's (WCD) El Rio Booster Plant (BP), we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by USEPA. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers', and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Reponse Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentiallly affected neighbors.\n\n2. General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of the El Rio BP is to pump groundwater, store, disinfects and distributes water to customers in the Cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme.  Chlorine is delivered in ton containers.  It is connected to the chlorinators to be mixed with water to make chlorine solution, then to be injected into water at several locations of the plant.  Access to the plant is restricted to authorized plant employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst-case Scenario - Failure of our largest chlorine storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air, in ten minutes.   The distance to th"

      "SummaryText": "e toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/L (3ppm)  would be 0.9 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - The gas valve (5/16\") on the one-ton container remains open and mitigation stops the release in one hour.  There would be chlorine gas release, and the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3ppm) would be 0.1 miles. \n\n1.4  Summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's RIsk Managment Program and California's Accidental Release Prevention Program and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is designed, constructed and operated in accordance with all applcable rules and regulations.  All of our operators are state certified system operators and are regularly trained and are competent to operate the process safely, in accordance with the operating procedures.\n\n1.5  Summary of the Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\n1.6  Summary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have discussed this program with the Ventura County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Ventura County Fire Department.  A representative of the Ventura COunty Fire Department visited the El Rio BP on March 11, 1999.\n\n1.7  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe El Rio BP was constructed in February 1998 and is in compliance with all applicable Federal, Satate, and United WCD's safety rules and regulations.  We continue to train and require all employees to partcipate in safe work practices, and to improve our operations in accordance with Federal and State safety guidelines."
