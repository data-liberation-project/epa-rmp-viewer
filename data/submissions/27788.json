Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and mixing of anhydrous ammonia, which is used for manufacturing 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer (ammonium phosphate) and aqua ammonia.  The ammonium phosphate and aqua ammonia are used for blending into other liquid fertilizer mixtures and for wholesale distribution to other facilities as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 460,000 pounds stored in one 30,000 gallon storage tank and two 80-ton railcars.  The maximum fill level of the tank and each railcar is 85% of the total tank capacity.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled at the facility would occur when two railcars and the stationary tank are at the maximum fill level of 85%. \n\nBetween 85 and 100 days per year, 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.

The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by high-pressure gas cargo railcars and is stored in the 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The manufacturing process is subject to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard and program 3 requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program.\n\nThe maximum stored quantity of aqua ammonia at the facility can be approximately 120,000 gallons (912,000 pounds) stored in four 30,000 gallon storage tanks (228,000 pounds each).  The tanks can be filled to 100% full, but seldom are filled more than 92% - 93% full, which is measured by a liquid level gauge.  Aqua ammonia is shipped to other facilities only in transport trucks; railroad cars are not used.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia stored at the facility would occur when all four stationary storage tanks are full and would be approximately 912,000 pounds.  All four storage tanks are located within a concrete secondary containment structure that can hold approximately 60,000 gallons.  The handling and storage of the aqua ammonia is subject to program 2 requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of all the anhydrous ammonia from one 80-ton railcar.

The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.60 miles, which is limited by the size of the concrete secondary containment structure.  There were no administrative controls considered in this scenario.  There was one passive mitigation measure considered in this scenario, which is the size (approximately 7,800 square feet) of the concrete secondary containment.  The small size limits the spread (i.e., surface area or maximum pool area) of the ammonia solution and consequently the rate of evaporation and release of ammonia.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario for the 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer and aqua ammonia manufacturing processes involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a three inch hose during transfer of ammonia from a railcar.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 27,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 13,500 pounds per minute over a two minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoi"

There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for handling and storage of aqua ammonia involves a release of aqua ammonia from a break/rupture in a hose during transfer from one of the storage tanks to a transport truck.  The quantity of aqua ammonia (29% ammonia solution) released would be approximately 4,100 pounds of solution released as liquid with approximately 1,200 pounds of ammonia (4,100 pounds x 29%) being release as a vapor (i.e., evaporating) from the solution over 43.2 minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.11 miles.  The active mitigation measure considered which may assist in limiting the release duration is listed in section 3.16 and is manual shutting of valves.  There were no passive mitigation measures that affected this scenario, even though the storage tank is located within a concrete secondary containment structure.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps for Handling and Storage of Aqua Ammonia:  This facility complies with EPA\u00bfs accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.
