NABR uses several chemicals in this process that are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The toxic properties of these chemicals make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions.  These precautions are in place to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of this rural community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle our chemicals, the safety devices we have designed into our facility, the safe handling procedures we utilize, the training of our employees and the knowledge of the management.\n\nOur emergency response program is consistent with good and prudent operating procedures for a plant our size and location.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for direct notification of the residences within the possible and probable receptor zone as well as the local fire and emergency response authorities.\n\nThe stationary source and regulatory substances handled\n\nThe only purpose of this facility is to manufacture a halogenated organic element.  This site is very remote and rural.  The entire site is surrounded by a security fence and is monitored 24 and 7.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances at this facility are chlorine, sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and hydrochloric acid.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - complete failure of the storage vessel and all related integral safety devices.  The specifics of each substance are listed in the following chart.  The RMP Comp dispersion model was used.\n\nRegulated Wors"
