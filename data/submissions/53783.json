Indiana Bio Energy was aquired by Green Plains Renewable Energy, Inc. and the facility's name was changed to Green Plains Bluffton, LLC.\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC is a newly constructed facility.  Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Green Plains Bluffton, LLC is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC ethanol plant is located in Bluffton, Wells County, Indiana.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Green Plains Bluffton, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 1.10 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denatu"

The worst case toxic cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, recreation areas, schools, and other public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 1.10 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools, and other public receptors are located within this 1.10 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Green Plains Bluffton, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on site.  There have been no accidents since the establishment of Green Plains Bluffton, LLC.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nGreen Plains Bluffton, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Green Plains Bluffton, LLC 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and "
