A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety and the environment.    \n\nThe Mesa facility is committed to The Goal is Zero initiative, striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety and environmental performance throughout our products' life cycles.  Product Stewardship and The Goal is Zero initiatives not only make good ethical and moral sense, but they respond to what our customers want and our communities expect: that we operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities designed and implemented at the Mesa facility. \n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe FUJIFILM Electronic Materials Mesa facility processes and supplies ultra high purity chemicals to the semiconductor and silicon wafer industries.  Products include acids, etchants, solvents and custom blend formulations. Current operations use the following toxic chemicals identified by EPA as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in manufacture of ammonium fluoride solutions.  A maximum 67,200 pounds is stored on site at the facility.\nAmmonia solutions (>20%) are stored on site prior to distribution to customers; maximum inventory is 45,000 pounds "

A maximum 52,800 pounds (on a 100% basis) could be stored on site at any one time.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.  There are no RMP-regulated flammable chemicals handled or stored at/above threshold quantities at the Mesa facility.\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  To minimize the chance of an release with offsite implications, the Mesa facility has six layers of safety and environmental protection; our employees, mechanical integrity programs, hazard reviews, process controls, monitoring systems and emergency response.  \n\nEmployees: Well trained employees are our most important resource in operating our facilities and in protecting the community.  \nMechanical Integrity: This comprehensive inspection and testing program for operating equipment provides more reliable and well-maintained equipment, which greatly reduces the probability of failure.\nHazard Reviews:  Reviews are conducted on all porcesses within the facility handling hazardous materials. Hazard Reviews identify things that could possibly go wrong so that these situations can be corrected and controlled before an incident occurs.\nProcess Controls:  The Mesa Facility has a variety of back-up systems which provide precise control of processes and maintain tight operating parameters.\nMonitoring Systems:  Product sensing detectors immediatel"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that such management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  In January 2003, we obtained certification to the ISO14001 Environmental Management System standard which further supports our commitment to our employees, the community and continual improvement of our operations.\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nInvestigation records are maintained for all incidents that occur at our facility.  We have had one (1) accidental release of hydrofluoric acid in the last five years that meets the RMP rule reporting criteria.  This incident involved an injury to a contractor employee that required medical attention from the release of one pound of 55% liquid hydrofluoric acid.  The injury had no long term effects on the individual and there was no off site impact.  A formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause of the event was conducted and corrective actions implemented.\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major spill or release, the Site Emergency Response Teams goal is to contain any releases and to correct the problem before any off-site impact occurs.  Our emergency response plan (ERP) addresses the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning, providing the essential elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  \n\nTo assist us i"

On site drills and training are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe City of Mesa Fire Department is responsible for notifying the public of any release which has potential off-site impacts utilizing a \"reverse 911\" alert system.\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlanned facility improvements whose implementation will help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment includes installation of a water deluge system over the bulk tanks/bulk unloading area to maximize our ability to contain acid vapors from potential releases within the area.\n\nIn addition, plans are being made to initiate regular joint onsite emergency drills/training between the City of Mesa Fire Department and Hazmat Teams and FUJIFILM Electronic Materials Emergency Response Team members."
