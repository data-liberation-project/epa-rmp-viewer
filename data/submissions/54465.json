      "SummaryText": "The Supervalu - Pittsburgh Distribution business is grocery warehousing and distribution to client grocery stores.  This building complex includes a Dry Grocery/Dairy Warehouse and a Perishable Warehouse.  Both buildings are expansive, and both contain ammonia refrigeration systems, but only the Perishible Warehouse system contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  There are no likely events which might cause simultaneous catastrophic releases from both facilities simultaneously.\n\nThe facility has an active OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Access to the ammonia refrigeration process is restricted to only a select few, well-trained and specifically authorized employees.  The compressors and major pressure vessels are housed within a designated mechanical equipment room.  The facility consists of warehousing freezers and product coolers which are maintained at various temperatures, from -20F degrees to +45F degrees.  All of the freezer piping and equipment is located above the roof.  Piping for the coolers, as well as the air cooling units, are located within the cooler spaces and above the facility roof. \n\nA worst-case scenario release of ammonia from this process would have off-site consequences.  However, all of the more-likely release scenarios would have consequences more or less restricted to the Supervalu property.  Emergency shutdown procedures and process control schemes have been developend and implemented which are readily available and operable:  these protective measures have been provided to accellerate the ability to control a release.\n\nThe process and its major components are inspected frequently.  Operating systems are continuously monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms which notify process operators of an upset.  The readily-distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the inhabited areas of the warehouse of any accidental releases that even the slightest leak has occurred.  All of the areas which contain ammonia piping and "

Each year, the facility interacts with representatives from the LEPC for updates of the plan elements.  The adjoining Hempfield Township Fire Department maintains a successful HAZMAT squad which is constantly available to assist in the event of a catastrophy.\n\nSupervalu - Pittsburgh continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it.  Recent improvements include the replacement of some 30 year old equipment and continuing to relocate piping and critical valves from inaccessible locations to accessible locations."
