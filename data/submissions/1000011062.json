This commitment to safety, the environment and sustainability is exercised daily. Personnel from every department take active rolls in quality assurance, accident prevention, training and community involvement.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\n\nForemost Dairies produce fluid milk and fluid milk products.  The facility utilizes a refrigerant (anhydrous ammonia) to cool milk products during production and to maintain the milk and milk products in the cooler vaults.  Anhydrous ammonia has a distinct odor that is self alarming in the event of a leak.  Anhydrous ammonia is also an environmentally friendly chemical and has excellent refrigerating properties.  Ammonia is one of the most common chemicals on earth.  Its most common use is in fertilizer.  The refrigerant is normally a gas at ambient temperature but is handled in the ammonia refrigeration system as a liquid & vapor under pressure.  The refrigeration system consist of a high pressure receiver, a recirculation system, evaporators, ice builders, chillers, compressors, condensers, piping & valves.  The refrigeration capacity is equivalent to producing approximately 500,000 lbs of ice daily.   \n\nACCICENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nAs a part of the PSM / RMP programs, Foremost Dairies has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The elements of these programs include: Process Safety Management, Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permits, and Contractor Safety. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nThe plant has not experienced any accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system during the past or previous five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMAT"

The system has additional capacity for adding defrost sequencing, ammonia detectors, etc.\n  \n"
