      "SummaryText": "The City of Midland (City) owns the T-Bar Intermediate Chlorination Station (Facility); it is part of the City of Midland T-Bar Systems.  The Facility is currently operated by a Contractor (currently PSC Water Operating Company).  The Facility is located at 14623 Southern Union Rd, Goldsmith, Ector County, Texas 79741.  The Facility location is further described as approximately 10 miles northwest of Goldsmith near the western boundary of Ector County; the southwest Facility gate is located at latitude, longitude 31.965585\u00b0, -102.786819\u00b0.  The center point of the chlorine storage area is located at 31.966753\u00b0, -102.786674\u00b0. The Facility disinfects well water from two (2) T-Bar well fields prior to gravity feed to the T-Bar Terminus Rechlorination Station. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the Facility.   Up to twelve (12) chlorine gas cylinders may be stored at the Facility resulting in a maximum possible on-site inventory of 24, 000 pounds. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Facility is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City\u0092s Director of Utilities is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  Day-to-day operations are conducted by the Facility contractor (PSC Water Operating Company).  The City\u0092s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is con"

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified Facility operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified Facility operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified Facility operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers\u0092 recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Facility has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the Facility will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\n\nThe Facility complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code.  The Facility is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Facility is located outside of the Midland city limits within Ector County; thus, the Facility is included in the Ector County-wide Emergency Response Plan.
