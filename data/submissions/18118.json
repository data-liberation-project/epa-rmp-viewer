This plant is operated by the Water & Sewer Board and has a capacity to process 4.5 million gallons of domestic waste per day.  It is located in Section 22, Township 18 North, Range 18 East, just south of Alabama Highway 14 approximately two and < miles west of the downtown Wetumpka area.  The plant address is 2909 Elmore Road, Wetumpka, Elmore County, Alabama.\n\nThis RMPlan has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code of Federal Register (CFR) part 6"

      "SummaryText": "8.  These regulations were promulgated by the EPA to cover the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act '112(r)(7).  These require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop a RMPlan.  The goal of a RMPlan is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts on the public.  Over 60 accidental releases of RMPlan regulated chemicals at waste treatment plants (WTP's) and wastewater treatment facilities in the United States were reported between 1986 and 1995. \n\nThe chemicals currently used in the wastewater process at this site that are covered by the regulation include chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, although the anhydrous ammonia threshold is greater than the amount stored on site.  It is also anticipated that sulfur dioxide (another covered chemical under the standard) will be added to the process in the near future.  The maximum potential amount of chlorine to be present on site at any one time is 8,000 pounds, and 4,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders, and although there is potential for 8,000 pounds to be present on the site at any one time, typically, at least on of the cylinders is empty so usually less than 6,000 pounds is on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 1,000-gallon above ground storage tanks.  It is anticipated that one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinders will be used in the process.  A maximum of 4,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide is anticipated to be stored on site.\n\nIn order to illustrate the areas that could be impacted from a release of the chemicals into the atmosphere, offsite consequence analyses were conducted.  Two offsite consequence analyses were performed for each of the chemicals of concern.  The first release scenario is the case defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the \"worst case\" scenario.  This scenario assumes t"

The second scenario (or alternative scenario) is based on a situation more likely to occur which will cause a release of chemicals at the facility.  The radius of impact was determined based on the guidance provided in Chapter 4: \"Offsite Consequence Analysis\" of the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs dated October 27, 1998.\nIn all release scenarios, the toxic end point concentration remains the same.  The toxic end point for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is three parts per million (ppm), and is 200 ppm for anhydrous ammonia.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has listed these concentrations as the \"maximum airborne concentration\", at which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.  Results of the off-site consequence analyses for the EPA \"worst case\" scenario led to an area defined by a 3-mile radius for chlorine, a 3.0- mile radius for sulfur dioxide, and a 1.2- mile radius for anhydrous ammonia.  These three-mile radii encompass the majority of the Wetumpka Incorporated area that includes a population of approximately 4,000 people (according to 1990 census data).  The alternative off-site consequence analysis yields significantly smaller areas.  The off-site analysis for chlorine indicates a 1.4-mile radius to the end point concentration, a sulfur dioxide area of 0.9-mile radius, and an anhydrous ammonia area of 0.4- mile radius. \n\nThe key to a successful risk management program is to first define hazard, risk and undertake a comprehensive approach to prevention.  The Center for Chemical Process Safety has defined hazard as:\n\nA chemical or physical condition that has the potential for causing damage to people, property or the environment \n\nOnce hazards are identified on the site, then, an evaluation of the risk involved wi"

The Water & Sewer Board has previously developed and implemented a safety program for the Wilako Wastewater Treatment Plant and this program is to become an integral part of this RMPlan to achieve the highest standards of safety and preparedness.  The safety program sets forth inspections and maintenance requirements of equipment, employees training and periodically reviewing readiness.  Throughout this RMPlan, the emergency readiness procedures and regular training schedules are emphasized.  One of the goals of implementing these procedures and schedules is to minimize the chance of a release occurring.  If the plant employees practice preventative maintenance and are well trained in emergency procedures, if a release occurs, they will be successful in preventing and minimizing personnel injury.\n\nAll employees of the Water Works are required to know the locations of the emergency telephone numbers and names of individuals to contact in case of a release.  If an emergency occurs, each employee will have an assigned task.  This risk management program enhances the safety plan already in operation because it provides a clear checklist that identifies predetermined individuals and agencies that require notification and coordination.  This RMPlan details which individuals will respond to the release to stop it and it outlines the agencies that will be responsible for evacuating the appropriate areas, and for sounding the \"all clear\" once the leak is contained.  The plan also includes procedures for the periodic review of readiness.\nThe Wilako Waste Water Treatment Plant has been operational for approximately two years, and to date, there have not been any major or minor reported releases from this facility.  The primary purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to maintain the plant's cur"

Currently, the Wilako Wastewater Plant stores and uses chlorine in quantities that exceed the published threshold amount.  Anhydrous ammonia, another covered chemical is used and stored on-site, but in quantities less than the threshold quantity.  Sulfur dioxide will likely be added to the process in order to improve the water treatment capabilities of the plant in the future and the anticipated amount may exceed the threshold quantity for that chemical.\n\nSpecific requirements which must be addressed in each facility's RMPlan depends upon the program level in which it falls.  The program level determination of a facility depends on several factors, including off-site consequence and coverage under other regulations.\n\nSection 2.2\tProgram Level Determination\n\nThere are currently three program levels.  A facility will be included in Program Level 1 if it exceeds one of the threshold quantities, but does not have any off-site consequence as determined by a hazard assessment.  Program Level 2 covers those facilities that exceed a threshold quantity, has off-site consequences, but are not regulated by the Occupational Health & Safety Administrative (OSHA).  Facilities that fall into Program Level 3 are subject to OSHA regulations, exceed a threshold quantity and have potential off-site consequence or the industry has one of the specified SIC codes.

The off-site consequence analysis (Reference Section 3) indicates that there could be off-site consequences if a chemical release of chlorine, anhydrous ammonia or sulfur dioxide occurred at the Wilako Wastewater Treatment Plant; therefore, the facility falls in Program Level 2.\n\nSection 2.3\tGeneral Requirements\n\nThe regulations outline five specific requirements for program Level 2 facilities.  By June 21, 1999, each facility covered under the Risk Management Program rule must have completed and submitted to the EPA a Risk Management Plan.  The EPA has requested that all submittals be transmitted electronically on their forms with appropriate figures or maps.  For reference, a copy of the form has been attached as Attachment A.  A facility in Program Level 2 must conduct a hazard analysis, develop a prevention plan, implement an emergency response plan, and report any chemical accidents in the past five years.\n Section 3\tHazard Assessment\n\nSection 3.1\tToxicology/Physical Properties\n\nIt is imperative that employees are informed about the physical properties and potential health hazards of the chemicals located at the facility.  Mishandling of the chemicals can lead to severe injury or even death; therefore, it is vital that information regarding the substances is available to all employees.

Various techniques for implementing a prevention plan are already outlined in the Wilako Wastewater Treatment Safety Program.  This prevention plan includes two categories.  The first category is prevention through maintenance and the second is prevention of injury through training.  Employees should be educated by attending routine safety meetings sponsored by the Plant, attend mandatory safety education classes, and working together to make their surroundings a reminder of proper safety procedures.  This can be done by hanging visual reminders such as posters, as well as maintaining a safety suggestion box that all deal with effective methods of prevention awareness.  In addition, assigning personnel to different duties or tasks in case of an emergency, and designating personnel to be responsible for safety equipment maintenance are all vital to a successful prevention program.

Whenever possible, no person should work alone on a chlorine leak.  An emergency plan of action should be implemented and include training or personnel who could become involved in a chlorine related emergency.\n\nEffective emergency response in handling chlorine leaks and spills depends on the effectiveness and competence of the employees on site who can assess a situation and act accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the supervisors to train their employees to use personal protective and other safety equipment properly.  It is also the responsibility of the supervisors to educate their employees properly handling chlorine and the dangers related to the mishandling of the chemical.  In addition, employees should participate in periodic drills to review the appropriate responses and know first aid procedures as well as who to call in case of an emergency.  These drills should include designating a person to check the chlorine monitors and wind direction indicators to determine if an evacuation is necessary, an evacuation plan, the proper safety equipment and the proper respiratory protection to wear as well as the procedure for obtaining further assistance.  The telephone numbers of the chlorine suppliers should be posted near each telephone.  \n\nIn addition, the number for the Chlorine Institute's Emergency Plan (CHLOREP) through CHEMTREC in the United States is (800) 424-9300"

In some instances, depending on whether there has been a \"reportable quantity\" leaked, some governmental agencies must be contacted for chlorine emissions.  If an evacuation is necessary, then potentially exposed persons should move to a point upwind of the leak since chlorine is heavier than air.  If evacuation seems impractical, all air conditioners and air intake systems should be turned off; and individuals should retreat to the highest point of the building on the side away from the release.  When a person is outdoors, and they do not have respiratory protection, they should cover their mouth and nose with a wet handkerchief or cloth to reduce the effects of the exposure.\n\nPersonal protection equipment should be available outside of chlorine rooms, near each use point, away from areas likely subject to contamination.  Respiratory equipment should be selected based on evaluation of hazards and the degree of potential exposure.
