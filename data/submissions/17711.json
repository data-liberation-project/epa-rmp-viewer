      "SummaryText": "1)  THE FACILTIY POLICY:  The owners, management, and employees of Sure Crop Care, Inc.,  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  2)  FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 26,265 pounds in one 6,000 gallon storage tank in Carlton.  3)  THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE: A) The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 26,265 pounds in one 6,000 gallon tank in Carlton, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.36 miles in Carlton.  B)  The alternative release scenario based on the 5 year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 220 ppm) is 1.36 miles in Carlton. 4)  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,\" Published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  5)  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that:  Have caused any"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
