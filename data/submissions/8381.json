Neeland\n1.The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at this facility. The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \" AG-21\" member,  one of three in the State of Kansas.  AG-21 is a program that is Enviromental Driven. The Coop goes above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customer, employee, and enviroment.\n2.Facility Information\nThe facility is located two miles south of Great Bend Kansas, however there are homes in the area. The facility activities involves dry, liquid and NH3 fertilizers as well as bulk and packaged chemicals. The main warehouse has containment for accidental spills. The maxium NH3 storage at this facility is 38,000 gal. contained in 2 tanks of 12,000 and 26,000 gal.\n3.The Worst Case Release and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would be the release of 177,581 pounds during a 10 minutes period 17,758 pounds per minute. This would travel five miles to end point. Alternative release could involve over filling this could travel up to .010 miles to end point.\n4.Acidental Release Prevention Program.\nThe Coop recognizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal regulations. The Coop also complies with recommendations from Farmland's AG-21 policies and gerneral industry standards. The most common accidental release would be the over filling of nurse trailers. An example would be if the trailer would be filled to 85-90% on a cool morning and the air temperture rises the product could expand and cause the pressure relief valve to let product escape. The figures expressed are estimates.\n5.Five Year Accident History\nThe Coop has not had a accidental release within the past five years.\n6.Emergency Response Program\nThe Coop has an Emergency Respose Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and Employee Safety Committee.
