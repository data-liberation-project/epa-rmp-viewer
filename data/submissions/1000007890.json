This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nGarelick Farms-Lynn is located on an approximate 20 acre site. Garelick Farms - Lynn produces and distributes its dairy products throughout the East Coast. The product line includes milk, cream and juices. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for product, process and space cooling. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, evaporative condensers, support equipment, piping and valves.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe facility has developed, implemented and maintained a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\n* OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\n* Close cooperation with the Fire Department for emergency response training.\n* Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n* Plant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n* Periodic Safety Meetings.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration systems during the past five years"
