Plant 1 facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Ammonia Action Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 1 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\nAmmoni"

The building was used as a passive mitigation measure.  The release rate was calculated as 820 lbs./min.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, Exhibit 4-4 for an urban area, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affectted by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia (180 psi).  The release rate was calculated (using a simplified version of the Bernoulli equation) as 134 lbs./min.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 6000 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, Exhibit 4-5 for an urban area, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\nIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\nIIAR Bulletin 110, \"Start"

Plant 1 has an Emergency Ammonia Action Plan in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nThe facility conducts annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe RMP Development Team made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These recommendations are a result of the review of the PSM prevention programs and the Emergency Response Program for preparation of the Risk Management Program and Plan. These recommendations are planned to be completed by December 31, 1999 and are as follows:\n\nR01  Include the P&IDs from the Standard Operating Procedures notebook in the PSI section of the PSM notebook.  Separate the P&IDs by plant number.\n\nR02 Include a copy of the ammonia MSDS in the PSI section of the PSM notebook.\n\nR03 Move the Ammonia Inventory Calculation sheets from the back of the PSM notebook to the PSI section.\n\nR04 Complete the Ammonia Inventory Calculation sheet for Plant 3.
