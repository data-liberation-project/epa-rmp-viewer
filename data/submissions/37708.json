      "SummaryText": "Walton Wholesale & Retail RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Walton Wholesale and Retail Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular). This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since the end of 1989. The General Manager is Joe Johnson and the Operations Manager is Tom Mills.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately four acres and is situated four miles west of of the intersection of State Routes 1 and 218, on the western edge of the town of Walton.  There is one residence across the road, on the south side of 218.  The town of Walton is located on the east side of the facility, across the railroad tracks.\n\nWalton manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 40,000 tons of polyphosphate fertilizer per year.  Walton also produces a fertilizer solution called aqua ammonia, which is made by combining water and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOne of the RMP-regulated materials involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  Three 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 76,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nThe other RMP-regulated material at this facility is aqua ammonia. The facility manufactures aqua ammonia for resale to the farmers.  Aqua ammonia is a solution containing anhydrous ammonia and water.  Two one-million gallon tanks,  two 56,000 gallon tanks and six 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk"

      "SummaryText": "storage of  the aqua ammonia. \n\nAnhydrous and aqua ammonia are not poisons, but they are an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are non-flammable gases.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and, therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck or railcar) to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the loading station to the nurse wagons.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow. \n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \u00bfevents\u00bf are very short in duration \u00bf a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic"

All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n\u00bf  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open dire"

A copy of the Walton Emergency Action Plan is on file with the LEPC and the local fire departments.\n\nSecurity Plans\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) 49 CFR Part 172, requires all facilities that offer or transport hazardous materials to document a security plan and perform employee awareness training.  \n\nA security assessment plan has been created to describe all security measures at this facility, identify any vulnerable areas and then document the measures taken to address those risks.  The plan is intended to work in conjunction with the Emergency Action and Spill Control Plan to meet all required criteria.\nAll potential employee candidates are interviewed prior to hiring.  Candidates with a CDL receive additional previous employment verification and a record is kept in their Driver\u00bfs Qualification file. References may be verified depending on the level of familiarity with the person.\n\nThere is a fence around the entire perimeter of the facility.  There is a security system for the office and chemical buildings.   This includes fire protection.   Each employee has his own code for arming and disarming the system.   Management controls employee access.  A report is available to detail all access activity. All bu"

      "SummaryText": "ildings and vehicles are secured during non-business hours.\n\nPackaged and bulk insecticides are stored in the chemical building at the north end of the facility. Inventory is closely monitored and access to visitors is restricted unless accompanied by Anderson personnel.\n\nThere are three bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks at the southeast end of the property. Valves are locked when not in use. Anhydrous ammonia is received via railcar or tank truck.  Several railcars may be staged on the tracks at one time.   Mobile nurse wagons and tender trucks are used to deliver anhydrous ammonia to the customer. Nurse wagons are pumped empty after seasonal use. Empty nurse wagons are staged at the south end of the property. The anhydrous ammonia tanks and nurse wagons are visually inspected daily. \n\nPhosphoric acid is transported to the facility by railcar and staged at the tracks until product is transferred to the liquid fertilizer production area.  Inbound railcars are sealed and these seals are inspected as part of the receiving process.  Broken seals would be reported to the railroad.  \n\nInbound shipments of all products are inspected prior to storage or resale.  Any suspect product would be segregated and investigated.  Outbound shipments of insecticides are accompanied by DOT shipping papers and placards, if necessary. These documents are offered to farm customers before they leave our facility.  Any suspicious product sales or inquiries would be investigated by The Andersons Safety and Security Department and shared with local authorities. \n\nEmergency procedures have been documented in the attached Emergency Action Plan and have been shared with the local Fire Department and LEPC.  Emergency phone numbers are posted outside the office.\n\nTraining is performed with all employees annually and within 90 days of employment."
