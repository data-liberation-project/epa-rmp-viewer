Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe, at the Andover Manufacturing Center of The Gillette Company (Gillette, AMC) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our plant.  We are completely coordinated with the Town of Andover Fire department, which provides emergency response expertise in the event of an accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur plant's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of toiletry products (e.g. aerosol shave creams and shave gels).  We have two regulated substances present at our facility in two different processes.  These substances include a blend of isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] and propane; while the other process involves a blend of isopentane [butane, 2-methyl-] and isobutane [propane, 2-methyl].  All of the regulated substances at our facility are used in the production of aerosol toiletry products.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of our two different processes at any one time are as follows:  Isopentane [butane, 2-methyl-] and isobutane blend [propane, 2-methyl] (Blowing Agent) has a maximum quantity of approximately 127,000lbs and the isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] and propane blend (A46) has a maximum on site quantity of approximately 115,000lbs.  \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur plant has systems in place to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This plant was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of p"

      "SummaryText": "rocesses at our plant are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nGillette, AMC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur plant conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and adequately controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety, environment and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\nWe employ an overall risk assessment (ORA) prior to the installation of any new regulated equipment or process.  Like the PHA, the ORA is conducted by a team of various qualified personnel with expertise in areas such as engineering, process operations, facilities, safety, and environment.  This is conducted in the early design phase of a project in order to address, and potentially design out, identified risks.\n\n\n\nAny non-routine activities that take place in our plant are preceded by a Quick Risk Prediction (QRP).  Personnel involved in the task and those working in the area review all possible risks associated with the activity and either eliminate the risk, minimize the risk, or make everyone aware of the presence of the risk.  QRPs also include any contractors that may be involved.  \n\n\n\nEach shift team meeting begins with a Safety Trigger, which is a safety assessment of the planned work conditions and activities for that shift.  Each safety trigger assessment is either rated green (low hazard),"

A yellow or red assessment will trigger the operating shift team to perform a Quick Risk Prediction or determine other mitigating actions to minimize the risk during that shift.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Gillette, AMC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nGillette, AMC has comprehensive training programs in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Gas Room Operators (GROs) receive a thorough initial training program prior to operating a gas room and refresher training is provided at a minimum of every six months.  \n\n\n\nDepartments utilize training 'step up cards' to document the skills necessary to perform their job with excellence.  There is a separate Health, Safety and Environmental step up card which documents the skill sets required to perform work safely, and in compliance with all laws and regulations.  Technicians that work with covered processes at AMC are required to complete an HS&E step up card as a condition of their employment at the Andover Plant.    \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nGillette, AMC carries out documented preventive maintenance (PM) checks on process equipment to ensure proper and reliable operations.  Process equipment examined by these PMs includes among others; pressure vessels, thermal systems, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance pra"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the PMs are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Gillette, AMC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to understand the modification.  The management of change (MOC) team is comprised of representatives from engineering, quality assurance, safety, environmental, microbiology, validation and process safety.  No changes are allowed to be made to covered processes without full approval from the site MOC team.    \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Gillette, AMC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing regulated equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nGillette, AMC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  Each RMP audit is led by either internal or external Health, Safety and Environmental resources.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nGillette, AMC has a system in place to promptly investigate any incident or near miss that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The investigation would be undertaken to identify a situation potentially leading to an incident, as well as identifying any corrective and preventative actions.  All reports "

A Multi-Cause Analysis form (MCA) is used to document the root cause and corrective and preventative actions stemming from incident or near miss investigation.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nGillette, AMC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from ORAs, Process Hazard Analyses, and Management of Change.  \n\n\n\nAll employees participate in facility's Behavior Observation System (BOS) and Ongoing Feedback Systems, (OFS).  These two systems encourage AMC employees to observe their peers throughout the working day in order to ensure employee and process safety at all times.  If an unsafe behavior or condition is observed, each employee is required to provide real time feedback and reinforcement to correct the issue.   \n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.   Gillette, AMC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  This information is shared through the contractor on-boarding program, which is a requirement before any contractor can perform work on site.  Gillette, AMC utilizes a construction management company during times of increased project construction to further support ongoing construction safety.   \n\n\n\n\n\n4.

Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nGillette, AMC has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency action including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, incidental chemical spill cleanup, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Gillette, AMC emergency action teams are trained to evacuate the area and notify local responders in cases where actual emergency conditions are present.  The Andover Fire Department is on site at a minimum of once per year for facility orientation and inspection.    \n\n\n\nIn addition, the emergency action plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Process Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We have redesigned our tank farm unloading stations in order to ensure a greater distance from the propellant tanks.  We have also installed deluge systems for all propellant tanks and a flow-away dispersion zone in the tank farm.  These changes were implemented in 2013 and have further reduced the risk of an accident in our propellant tank farm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.
