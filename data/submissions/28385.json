Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Union City facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance and prevent injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. David Comer the Technical  Operation Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts, and physical property damage.\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn a"

Examples of such policies include:\n\n    Workplace Audits and Inspections\n    Corrective Action Tracking\n    Safety Performance Accountability\n    Job Hazard Evaluation\n    Lock, Tag and Try\n    Behavioral Safety Observations\n    Safety Suggest Program\n\nThe management at Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream has taken numerous actions to demonstrate its commitment to safety and implementation of safe work procedures.  Examples of such actions include:\n\n   Third-party compliance and safety system audits\n   Capital budgeting for ammonia system risk-reduction projects\n   Capital budgeting for ergonomic risk-reduction projects\n   Positive recognition for employees and teams who work safely\n   Offsite safety training for employees\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream operates an ammonia refrigeration system at the ice cream facility in Union City, CA.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7),  contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 40,000 pounds.  The system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program regulation.\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Dreyer's facility involves the release of 31,800 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it may only be full once every 10 years during a substantial system pump-down. Since the facility is located in a populated area,  the release would reach off site end points and near by public receptors. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe wo"

Under alternative release weather conditions,  this scenario would result in a release that would reach off-site end points and near by public receptors.   This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n  Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices;\n\n The system is operated at considerably lower pressures (maximum 135 psig) compared to the PSV's relief pressure setting (300 psig);\n\n  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service; and the receiver is regularly inspected and maintained. \n\n\n  The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-go"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have access to the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the HAZOP and What If Techniques have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety. \n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nContractors: Contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required  for new ammonia projects to verify that safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and c"
