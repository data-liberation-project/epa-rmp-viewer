Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Top of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility in Hanlantown, IA are strongly committed\nto employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the\nHanlantown Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in an 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Hanlantown (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 15,300 gallons (78,733.8 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (78,733.8 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distanc"

The\nscenario involves the release of 7,616.42 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of\nammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the facility\nis 150.\n\n\n\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information\nthat describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with\nall processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility maintains written operating procedures to ensure\nthat activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various\nmodes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators\ninvolved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility has a comprehensive training program in place\nto ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures\nassociated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Am"

Examples of process equipment that\nwould receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief\nand vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies\nidentified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Top of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility to manage\nchanges in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators,\nmaintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process\nconditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews\nrelated to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted\nto confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for\nsafe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility conducts compliance audits on a regular basis\nto determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented. \nAny non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nTop of Iowa Coop - Hanlantown Ammonia Facility truly believes that process safety management\nand accident prevention is a team effort.
