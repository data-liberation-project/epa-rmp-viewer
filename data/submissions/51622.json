SOUTH APPLEBY FACILITY\n\nMarkWest Pinnacle, L.L.C, owner and operator of the South Appleby Facility, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe South Appleby Facility process natural gas.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove any water.  The gas is then sent to a chiller where the temperature is reduced.  Condensates are separated from the natural gas stream gas stream.  Condensates generally consist of pentane and heavier hydrocarbons. The natural gas is then sent to a sales pipeline. Condensate is sent to one of three 400 BBL tanks. \n\nGlycol is pumped into the gas chiller to prevent the formation of hydrates.   The glycol absorbs the water.   Water is removed from the glycol through the use of a still where heat is added to the glycol to boil off excess water.  \n\nA refrigeration skid using refrigerant grade propane is used to cool the gas stream.  The propane remains in a closed loop system."
