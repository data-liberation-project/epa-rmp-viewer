              "Description": "The Newcastle Gas Plant is a refrigeration plant that recovers liquids from natural gas gathered from nearby wells.  The plant operates in an extremely rural area of NE Wyoming.  The closest residence is approximately 7 miles from the plant and there is an oil field office approximately 0.2 miles from the plant tank yard.  This office is not regularly staffed and has personnel in it early in the morning and late afternoon.  The Newcastle Gas Plant is manned 8 hours/day and operates in an unattended mode for the other 16 hours.  It is a PSM plant and operates under therequirements of the PSM program.  As such, all procedures, including emergency response, are verified and the operators are trained on them.  The plant is subject to the mechanical integrity inspection portion of the PSM program and all maintenance is conducted using properly trained mechanics.  The plant ships approximately 5 truckloads of propane or butane/gasoline mix out per week.  All truck loading takes place while the plant is manned and only experience and trained drivers are allowed to load out of the plant.  Drivers are required to be in attendance with their vehicle at all times during the loading process and have full access to the emergency shutdown activation points.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Newcastle Gas Processing Facility (Updated 2014)\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant is located about 25 miles southwest of Newcastle, Wyoming.  The facility includes natural gas liquid recovery using a refrigeration system, compression, dehydration, and fractionation.    The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, liquid propane, and a liquid product containing butane, pentane and heavier liquids.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  In 2011, two Sulfa-Treat vessels were added the facility to remove trace amounts of H2S gas that enters the plant with the raw gas from the field. The actual amount of H2s entering the plant is well below any threshold quantities for that substance.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Newcastle Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by the regulation.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupation"

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process and employee safety issues.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, our \"SafeStart\" behavior based safety program and participation in flowsheet reviews. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that "

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n \n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant uses the HAZOPS method of conducting process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the processes.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Newcastle Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown as well as consequences of deviation from the design basis.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Newcastle Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are "
