Statement of Policy\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Akebono Brake facility management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) by managing and operating the facility in accordance with appropriate regulations and general good operating practices. The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire or an accidental hazardous material release. Facility management has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\n\n\nAkebono Brake personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the emergency action management to assure successful resolution of any emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Source Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Akebono Brake facility is located at 780 International Blvd., Clarksville, TN, in the county of Montgomery. The site is east of Interstate 24 and south of Highway 79.\n\nThe Akebono Brake ammonia process was installed in late 2011 and early 2012.  The regulated stationary source is Anhydrous Ammonia CAS #7664-41-7 and the maximum intended quantity is approximately 54,080 lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nWorst case and alternative case release scenarios have been prepared.  Please see onsite personnel for these documents.\n\n\n\nIV. Prevention Programs\n\n\n\nThe Akebono Brake facility has in place and is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule for the ammonia storage and use. This prevention program contains all chemical specific prevention steps for our accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nV. 5-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has experienced NO accidental releases from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI.

Our safety programs are under constant review by facility management. At least once a year the local responding Fire Department will be invited to the Akebono Brake for the following:\n\n\n\nBecome familiar with the operating practices.\n\nBecome familiar with members of the Emergency Action Team.\n\nBecome familiar with the Akebono facility, both outside and inside. This will be accomplished by a guided tour.\n\nBe given a review of the Emergency Action Plan, and how Akebono would see the Fire Department assisting in an emergency.\n\nReview Akebono emergency action equipment.\n\nGive a tour of the Ammonia storage and use system.\n\n\n\nIn addition, each of the items identified in the process hazard analysis will be used to improve the safety at Akebono Brake.  \n\n"
