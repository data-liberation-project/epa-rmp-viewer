Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Agriform's Woodland facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1,000 North East Street, Woodland, California, 95776 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia and ammonium polyphosphate. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by rail-car and stored in one 38,887-gallon rail-car and 18,000-gallon and one 22,400 gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 373,500 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight)  is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in one 416,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 3,120,000  pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is  936,000 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 198,300 pounds of anhydrous a"

The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release from a broken 3-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.9 miles.\n\nb.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 3,120,000 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 936,000 pounds ammonia based on a 30% active ingredient).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 14 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 8.2 miles.\n\nNote that in Sections 2 and 3, Toxics: Worst Case and Toxics Alternative Release, RMP*Comp (the program used for modelling the releases) reports 2.5 Quantity Released as actual pounds of aqueous ammonia solution released whereas 2.6 Release Rate is in pounds of contained ammonia. Release Rate multiplies by the concentration of active ingredient, 0.3 (30%).\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.

Specific planned changes to the aqua ammonia processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs."
