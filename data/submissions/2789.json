If an accidental release should occur, the facility\n        is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and \n        minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2)     The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n        Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and ditributed for direct application as a crop production\n        nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management \n        personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n        The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 196,000 pounds,  this \n        location has no rail tank car.\n\n3)     The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released\n       as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which \n       represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of.14mg/L for the worst case scenario is 2.7 miles.\n\n       The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break\n       in a transfer hose.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the alternative scenario is  .19 miles.  This release has the \n       possiblity of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4)    The accidental release prevention program.\n\n       This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes\n       and regulation"
