The policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in order to: 1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, 2) reduce the threat to employees' health, and 3) reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\n\n\nSafety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used, the training of personnel, and the manner in which an accidental release is handled.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe facility processes beef for the food industry. There are two regulated processes at the facility; each using anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration. One process contains a total of 27,000 pounds of ammonia. The second process contains a total of approximately 10,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Accidental Release Rule and all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nProperly trained personnel conduct daily inspections and maintenance activities on the ammonia systems.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe facility implements an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38. Employees receive training on an annual basis. The facility will notify the fire department in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility believes that safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Improvements to the program will be made as the opportunity arises."
