Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nFXI, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nFXI, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Newburyport, MA. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\r\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in two (2) 10,000-gallon and (2) 7,600-gallon TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area. The four (4) TDI Storage tanks have a combined storage capacity of 35,000-gallons. The 35,200-gallons of TDI equates to 3575,984 pounds of TDI.  For safety reasons, these tanks are never filled past 80%.  When including this 80% limit, the Maximum TDI on-site is 28,160 gallons (286,387 pounds), which was rounded up to 29,000 gallons and 287,000 pounds. \r\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\r\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is c"

A report of the findings of the audit will be developed.  FXI, Inc. will promptly determine and document an appropriate response to each of the findings of the compliance audit, and document that deficiencies have been corrected.  Records of the two (2) most recent compliance audit reports will be maintained.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: FXI, Inc. will investigate each incident, which results in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of TDI. Incident investigations will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. The incident investigation team will consist of at least one FXI, Inc. person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor. A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation, and FXI, Inc. will promptly address and resolve the incident findings and recommendations. Resolutions and corrective actions will be documented. Incident investigation reports will be retained for five (5) years.\r\n\r\nE. Five-year Accident History\r\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  The facility did have 1 incident on April 9, 2018 where 4 employees were exposed to TDI and were taken to the hospital for observation but were not admitted and were allowed to leave the same day as the incident occurred. \r\n\r\n\r\nF. Emergency Response Program\r\nFXI, Inc. has developed and implemented an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. \r\nThis program includes the following elements: \r\n1.

Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\r\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\r\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nC. Hazard Assessment:\r\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\r\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in t"

EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\r\nA catastrophic release of one 10,000 gallon bulk liquid storage tank of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) into an indoor secondary containment structure has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  The catastrophic release would release approximately 81,360 lbs. of TDI. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 72 yards for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property line.\r\n    \r\nThe alternative scenario is not required due to the worst-case scenario not extending beyond the property line.      \r\n      \r\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nProcess Safety Information: FXI, Inc. should complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review should be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \r\nHazard Review: FXI, Inc. should update and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and every five (5) years.
