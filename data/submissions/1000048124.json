The Facility Policy:  The owners, managers and employees of R & T Ammonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so that they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at R & T Ammonia is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 130,850 lbs in the facility's 3 tanks.  The capacities of these tanks are two 8,000 gallon tanks and one 12,000 gallon tank.  We may have as many as 40 nurse tanks at the storage area.\r\n\r\n3.  Worst Case Scenario:  Not Disclosed\r\n\r\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  R & T Ammonia complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  R & T Ammonia has a written emergency action plain in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emerg"
