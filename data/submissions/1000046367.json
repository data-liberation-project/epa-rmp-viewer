The survey showed that no population is within the 0.3 mile impact radius for the worst case release. The impact area on a map is demonstrated in appendix A. The types of public receptors and environmental receptors identified within the impact area are listed in Table 2-2.  Google Earth was used to find the public receptors within the impact radius.  As can be seen from the impact area map, the distance to the nearest public receptor from the facility is approximately 0.3 miles, which is beyond the 0.2 mile distance to the level of concern. Additionally, no environmental receptors are impacted by the worst-case release scenario."

(WPX) at the Ruby Pad.  This report provides the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the recovery skid system, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. EPA RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe system is designed to remove liquids from gas at the wellhead, having an inlet pressure between 150 and 400 psi.  The refrigeration system can operate at a chilling temperature as low as -40\u00b0F.  Recapture Solutions uses this system to remove liquids from flared gases.  The portability of the unit allows it to easily be moved from site to site when flaring ceases.  The PortaPack (LPG storage portable tank) is the only storage tank for liquid products, and has 18,000 gallons capacity. Recapture Solutions limits the maximum fill to 85% of the tank volume when the product temperature is above 0\u00b0F, 82% when the product temperature is below 0\u00b0F, or 80% when the product temperature is below -35\u00b0F. For the purpose of this assessment, the PortaPack is assumed to be completely filled to 85% of its total capacity (15,300 gallons), which is equivalent to 57,146 lbs. of flammable liquids.  \r\n\r\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP"

Recapture Solutions can store approximately 57,146 lbs of LPG and exceeds 10,000 lbs. threshold, thus the facility is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare a RMP.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n\r\nSection 24, 149N, 94W, McKenzie County, North Dakota\r\nLatitude: 47.703966, Longitude: -102.647251\r\nFrom New Town, North Dakota go west 11.1 miles on ND-23 to ND-22.
