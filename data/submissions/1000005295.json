Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Conroe Site having earned and maintained its ranking as an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Star site for excellence in safety performance.  In April, 2009, the Conroe site was also presented with OSHA's \"Star among Stars\" award at the annual Regional VPPPA Conference in Dallas,Texas. The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the processes and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in September 1992, the Conroe Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances - Huntsman's Conroe Site is located approximately five miles east of Conroe, Texas.  The Site is 476 acres, of which 100 acres have been developed.  The Conroe Site takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Conroe Site has 9 regulated substances at the facility.    \n\nThree flammable substances are:\nA? Dimethylamine (DMA) - Used in hair products, gasoline additives, as antistatic agents, fabric softeners and dyes.\nA? Hydrogen - Used to produce fuel additives and epoxy curing agents.\nA? Monomethylamine (MMA) - Used in gas treating of refinery and natural gas streams and as a textile softener.\nSix toxic"

These analyses are detailed in the registration section of this submission.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Conroe Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\nA? Process Safety Information\n Huntsman's Conroe Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\nA? Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\nA? The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\nA?

      "SummaryText": "Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant has performed a process hazard analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards, identify any previous incidents (that had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences in the workplace), the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of process changes. The PHAs also address consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility or stationary source siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. and ways to minimize those hazards.  The Conroe Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Conroe Site assigns employees to the HAZOP teams who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific processes.  The HAZOP teams develop recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Conroe Plant completes a PHA Revalidation for each covered process every 5-years (or less) meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards. \n \nA? Operating Procedures\n Huntsman Conroe Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and/or revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nA?

Mechanical Integrity\n Huntsman Conroe Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \nA? Management of Change (MOC)\n Huntsman Conroe Plant has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedure assures that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n \n \nA? Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n Huntsman Conroe Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; Management-of-Change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \nA?

Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n \n \nA? Incident Investigation\n Huntsman Conroe Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Conroe Plant establishes an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman Conroe Plant has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  The investigation process is tracked electronically from initial report through generation of the incident report and investigative team recommendations through the use of an electronic database visible to all plant employees. Finally, all incident reports are available electronically to all plant personnel.\n \nA?
