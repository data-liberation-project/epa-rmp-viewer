Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response to any release and minimize the impact of the release in our community and environment.\n\nFacility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nWorst Case/Alternative Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst case and alternate case scenario, however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information as request by the EPA.  There have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last five years.\n\nAccidental Release Program:  Effingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including the Illinois Department of Agriculture regulations as well as OSHA 29 CFR- 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  Effingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR- 1910.38.  Emergency planning and community right to know information is provided to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, LEPC and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Improving safety at Effingham Equity is an on-going process.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of"
