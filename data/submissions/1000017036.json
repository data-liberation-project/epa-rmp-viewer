      "SummaryText": "Rochester Water Reclamation Plant\nRisk Management Plant\n2010\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n2010 Update\n\nChemical use at the Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) remains the same since the last RMP submission in 2005.  The only chemical in use at the WRP that exceeds the Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold is chlorine.  An improvement to the chlorine gas storage system was made since the last RMP submission when a chlorine gas scrubber system was installed on the storage building.  The system is connected to online chlorine leak detectors.  In the event of a chlorine leak is detected by one of the two monitors in the storage area the system will turn on a blower, which will evacuated the air from the storage room and discharge it through a neutralizing media.  The solid media does not require any monitoring or replacement unless there is an actual leak which exhausts the media as the leak is neutralized. \n\nThe Purpose of the Risk Management Plan\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities, which use potentially hazardous material, to assess the risks of any accidental release and develop a plan to minimize these risks.  These regulations are referred to as the Risk Management Plan and are found in section 112R of The Clean Air Act.  It is the intent of these regulations to reduce the number of offsite injuries and death that could occur from the accidental release of a hazardous substance.\n\nWhat this Regulation Covers\n\nThe Rochester Water Reclamation Plant is the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) which treats the wastewater from the City of Rochester and its residents under the authority of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).  As a wastewater treatment plant the Rochester Water Reclamation Plant uses chemical that are common to the industry, including chlorine.  Chlorine is regulated under the risk management plan when used in quantities greater than 2,500 pounds (maximum use in the process).  Chlorine is stored in one ton (2,000 pound"

      "SummaryText": "cylinders).  \n\nChlorine\n\nThe Water Reclamation Plant is required by its NPDES permit to continuously disinfect its discharge from April through November of every year.  Chlorine has been used for many years as an economical, safe, effective agent for disinfection.  To ensure that disinfection is not interrupted when changing chlorine cylinders, it is common in the wastewater industry to have multiple cylinders connected at one time.  Once a cylinder is exhausted the system automatically switches over to the back-up cylinders, thus ensuring an uninterrupted supply to meet the continuous disinfection.  Because more than one cylinder is hooked up at a time, the process is considered to have greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine in it at one time.  Thus the Risk Management program rules apply.  \n\nEvaluation of Other Chlorine Storage Options \n\nAlthough it is possible to obtain chlorine in smaller 150 pound cylinders, this  is impractical for use at the Water Reclamation Plant.  The use of 150 pound cylinder at the Water Reclamation Plant would exhaust more than one cylinder every day.  Although the use of these smaller cylinders would eliminate the need for complying with the Risk Management Plan it would create a greater hazard in the number of connections which have to be made.  Connecting and changing of cylinders is an operation that can potentially cause an accidental release.  Therefore, an appropriate d cylinder is the safest all around alternative.  Chlorine is also available in larger rail car d container.  Rail cars are considered to be a higher risk for chlorine storage since the volume is greater and they are usually not contained in a building \n\nWorst Case Scenario Chlorine Release\n\nUsing the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance Document for Wastewater Treatment Plant's (EPA 550-B-98-010), the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint of an accidental release of chlorine is 1.3 miles in an urban setting.  This is a worst case scenario, which assumes the ent"

The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l (3ppm).\n\nAlternative Scenario Chlorine Release\n\nUsing the same guidance document the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint for an accidental release of chlorine is 0.2 miles or 1056 feet.  This alternative scenario assumes a wind speed of 3 meters per second, 25o C and a D stability.  This alternative scenario is calculated based on a release the release of the entire content of a chlorine cylinder over a period of eighteen minutes.  This is less than the rate of release for the worst case scenario because it takes into account the mitigating effect of the chlorine cylinders being stored inside a building.  This alternative scenario represents an accidental release that is more likely to occur than that of the worst case scenario.  This alternative scenario does not include the mitigating affects of the chlorine scrubber system which should neutralize any leaks but assumes that the scrubbing equipment malfunctions.  The 0.2 radius of the alternative or \"most likely\" release scenario is mainly contained within the WRP site.  The estimated population of this area is zero, but off course any employees, contactors or visitors on site could be affected by a release.  Emergency and evacuation  procedures for the facility are contained in the WRP's Process Safety management Program. \n\nOffsite Receptors \n\nIn the worst case scenario the 1.3 mile distance to endpoint would include a large residential area, several schools, public parks and business establishments.  The estimated population within that distance is 15,365 person using the LandView 6 program and 2000 census data.  This is the estimated population within the entire 1.3 mile radius around the facility.  Wind would limit the area impacted by a release to an actual area of less than 180o or half"

The Water Regulation Plant does neutralize the chlorine discharge prior to mixing with the receiving stream, the South Fork of the Zumbro River.  Instead of using a regulated chemical such as sulfur dioxide, the Water Reclamation Plant uses a safer alternative, liquid sodium bisulfite.  \n\nFlammable substances stored in quantities equal or greater than 10,000 pounds are also covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations.  The Water Reclamation Plant does store methane (a byproduct of wastewater solids digestion); however the methane is used for heating buildings and is therefore exempt from the plan requirements.
