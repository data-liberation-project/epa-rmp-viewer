The City of Escondido's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also to maintain a comprehensive safety and environmental program for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The City's Risk & Safety Administrator as well as the Deputy Director and Plant Superintendent are responsible for administering the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These policies/programs include (but are not limited to) job hazard analyses, hazard communication, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, operating procedures, emergency response, Process Safety Management (PSM) as well as the Risk Management Plan.  Various inspections and audits of the facility are conducted to ensure compliance as well as provide oversights of the policies in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored as a liquified gas under pressure using two 25-ton bulk storage tanks that are located indoors.  Administrative controls are in place such that each storage tank is filled to no more than 80% of capacity.  Therefore, each storage tank is filled to 20 tons.  The chlorine is withdrawn from one tank either as a) a pressurized gas and directed to the chlorinators or b) a pressurized liquid and directed to the evaporators.  The evaporators use heat to convert the liquid chlorine into a pressurized gas which is directed to the chlorinators.  Before reaching the chlorinators, the pressurized chlorine gas is reduced to vacuum conditions using vacuum regulators.  Chlorinators are then used to control the chlorine feed rate required to disinfect the water supply.  The metered chlorine from each chlorinator is directed to a dedicated injector which dissolves the c"

The chlorine solution is then introduced into the water supply to provide disinfection before distribution.\n\n\n\nChlorine is the regulated substance at this facility.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the City of Escondido-Vista Water Treatment Plant is 40 tons (80,000 pounds). \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the City of Escondido-Vista Water Treatment Plant was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  All of these codes serve to reduce the risk within the facility by specifying acceptable design criteria for the chlorine system and on-site buildings.  In addition, the facility was designed in accordance with industry standards and with generally accepted engineering practices.  The City of Escondido-Vista Water Treatment Plant has established a mechanical integrity program for maintaining and operating the chlorine equipment.  In addition, the facility is in compliance with the following regulations regarding chlorine handling:\n\n\n\n1)California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program;\n\n2)Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n3)EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP)\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system is designed to operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to provide a safe water supply for distribution.  To ensure safe operations, the chlorine system is located within a dedicated Chlorine Building that is equipped with chlorine sensors that can detect leaks in the various rooms.  The chlorine sensors trigger alarms at 1 ppm and 3 ppm.  In the event that the 1 ppm alarm is triggered, the ventilation louvers in the affected area will open.  In the event that a chlorine release triggers the 3 ppm alarm, the louvers will close, the caustic scrubber will scrub the air withdr"

The scrubber continues to operate until it is shut-off manually at the scrubber containment area.  The scrubber is capable of neutralizing 25 tons of chlorine.  Emergency shutdown switches are located at the control panel in the main control room, the PLC in the operations building control panel, and upstairs by the tank valves next to the exit door.  If there is a power failure, the pneumatic valves will close because air pressure is lost.  At least one operator is on-site at all times to monitor the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation on February 19, 2014, there have been no significant releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or in the last five years (February 2009 - February 2014). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Escondido-Vista Water Treatment Plant has an emergency action plan in effect.  This plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning section of the Risk Management Program document and was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3"

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe City of Escondido-Vista Water Treatment Plant's Deputy Director is the designated emergency coordinator for the plant.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures and will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the plant.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe City of Escondido-Vista Water Treatment Plant has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety.  To improve safety, the chlorine system is routinely inspected and audited.  The facility is currently in the process of completing recommendations made during the PHA Revalidation. The facility conducted a PSM audit (August 2011) and a PHA Revalidation (February 2014). Recommendations from these studies are underway. \n\n\n\nIn addition , the facility is planning to complete the following items over the next year in their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for its employees:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
