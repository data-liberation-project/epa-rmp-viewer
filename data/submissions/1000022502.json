The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site. The Allied facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community. Allied's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the \"One Plan\".\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers). In addition, Allied manufactures 10.5%-15% (by weight) sodium hypochlorite, and 38% (by weight) sodium bisulfite. The facility includes a private sidetrack for unloading chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks and for sodium hypochlorite production and quality control testing. Sodium bisulfite production operations are at a separate location within the facility, with a scrubber for the manufacturing process. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection system continuously monitors all production and storage locations. Based upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a \"covered process\", the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STE"

      "SummaryText": "PS\nThe Allied accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nA? Compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29CFR A?1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (40 CFR A?68),\nA? Implementation of the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution Process Code,\nA? Operator Function Specific and Emergency Response Training,\nA? Employee Hazardous Communication and Personal Protective Equipment Training,\nA? Preventative maintenance schedule,\nA? Use of Chlorine Institute and Compressed Gas Association recommended equipment,\nA? Use of effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators, facility managers and corporate managers,\nA? Performance of a process hazard analysis,\nA? Implementation of a three year program internal auditing program.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo deaths, evacuations, and/or shelter in place do to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years. One employee injury due to chlorine exposure in the last five years, and zero employee injuries due to sulfur dioxide exposure in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in January 2011 (Emergency Contact Phone Numbers updated annually). The plan includes the following elements:\nA?    description of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes,\nA?    recommended first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures,\nA?    a list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located,\nA?    list of onsite and offsite emergency response personnel and contact numbers,\nA?    detailed description of company personnel,\nA?    emergency and non-emergency contact numbers,\nA?    procedures for reporting and handling the releases,\nA?    site and evacuation plans,\nA?    procedures for plan review and update as well as training requirements for emergency responders.\n"
