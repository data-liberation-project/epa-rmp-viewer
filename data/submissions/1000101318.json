To this end, the management actively supports the implementation of safe work procedures for all aspects of the operations, including the processing of the one regulated substance:  hydrofluoric acid (HF), 70% or less.  The facility follows the regulation and intent of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThis facility utilizes HF as an integral component of the manufacturing operations of inorganic compounds and refining of nonferrous metals.  HF is delivered to the facility in tank trucks.  Delivered HF is unloaded into one of three bulk storage tanks.  During delivery, HF trucks are flange-connected at the unloading fill station and compressed air is used to off-load the acid.  At all points during delivery, a qualified facility employee and qualified personnel from the supplier remain with the delivery truck.  From the bulk HF storage tanks, measured quantities of HF are pumped into process vessels in four buildings.  During the transfer of HF to the process vessels, HF is added to water and the concentration of HF immediately drops below 50% by weight and is no longer regulated by RMP.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, facilities that contain a regulated substance (such as HF) at quantities exceeding the RMP threshold must consider the impact of a worst-case and an alternative-case release of the substance. GAM utilized the U.S. EPA RMP*Comp model and the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance reference tables and equations to determine the potential impacts of both release scenarios. The worst-case scenario is based on the largest single vessel containing HF (i.e., the bulk HF storage tank shared by Buildings 073 and 087) and assumes that the entire tank volume is released into the diked area surrounding the vessel. The alternative scenario assumes t"

U.S. EPA's MARPLOT software and other publicly-available resources were utilized to update the residential population and the public and environmental receptors for the 2023 OCA.\n\nUpdate November 2023: GAM intends to fill the second bulk HF storage tank that is shared by Buildings 073 and 087, which was previously installed but remained empty when the 2023 RMP 5-Year Resubmission was submitted. The two bulk HF tanks shared by these buildings are identical in size and have identical, but separate, containment areas. There is no interconnection between the two tanks that would increase the maximum single-vessel quantity release that was used for the 2023 OCA worst-case scenario. In addition, GAM has reviewed the alternative release scenario and has determined that this scenario also will not change as a result of filling the second bulk HF tank. The processes associated with Buildings 073 and 087 have been updated to reflect the new total amount of HF associated with each building, equal to the volume of both bulk HF tanks. The increased storage volume of HF does not change the Facility's program level since the processes associated with Buildings 073 and 087 were already Program Level 3 processes prior to this change.\n\nAs part of this facility's commitment to provide a safe work environment, GAM has implemented a number of programs to enhance safety.  Pertinent PSM & RMP information is communicated to plant personnel weekly to review plant safety, health and environmental issues.  General awareness HF training is given to all employees and contractors.  Operators of HF systems receive additional site-specific training.  Components of HF systems are covered under a Mechanical Integrity program to assure that they operate safely and are physically sound.

Changes to the processes are reviewed under Management of Change procedures.  Pre-Start Safety Reviews are conducted prior to the implementation of any process change. Contractors receive extensive safety training prior to beginning work in the facility and receive additional site-specific safety training for their assigned work area.  Competence of contractors is assured as part of the contractor selection process.  Hot work and other safe work permit programs are in place in the facility.  Process Hazard Analyses using the HAZOP methodology are conducted to identify potential hazards and areas for improvement.  Any incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and identify changes to prevent recurrence.  The Risk Management Program is outlined and discussed in a PSM/RMP program document in use at the facility.\n  \nGAM demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety through a continuous accident prevention program and active participation in the OSHA VPP STAR program.  All incidents and near misses are reported and investigated to identify root causes with corrective actions directed at preventing reoccurrence.  Investigation results are communicated to all on-site employees and contractors for awareness.  GAM has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to assure safe response to incidents involving HF and other chemicals.  The EAP is reviewed and updated when a significant change to a chemical system occurs.
