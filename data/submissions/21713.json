To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nHenderson maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the ARTAH regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Henderson Cold Storage facility is located at 830 Horizon Drive in Henderson, Nevada.  The facility uses ammonia as the refrigerant to provide cooling for the dock and freezer areas.  Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for cold storage areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR1) to the Refrigerant Recirculators (RRP1&RRP2).  The Recirculators cycle ammonia to the evaporators, where the liquid vaporizes and draws heat from the cold storage area.  The ammonia vapor is drawn to the compressors and pumped to the condensers, where the vapor is condensed into ammonia liquid.  This liquid flows to the thermosyphon which then feeds the Receiver.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its"

      "SummaryText": "temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 4 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side.  \n\n\u00bf Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\u00bf The total ammonia inventory is 16,160 pounds.  (NOTE:  Item 1.17 c.3 is rounded to two significant figures as per EPA's instructions.)\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary:\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel.  The Intercooler has a capacity which is greater than the charge of the Phase III system, thus it is assumed to hold the entire charge of 16,160 pounds of ammonia for the worst case scenario.  (NOTE:  Item 2.5 is rounded to two significant figures and 2.6 is rounded to one significant figure as per EPA's instructions.) Since the intercooler is enclosed by the machinery room, passive mitigation effects were taken into consideration when determining the release rate of ammonia to the outside atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  This facility is located in an urban setting.  The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998.  This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressu"

(NOTE:  Item 3.5 is rounded to two significant figures and 3.6 is rounded to one significant figure as per EPA's instructions.) This release could occur due to a gasket rupture, pinhole leak, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc. In addition, this release could occur outside; therefore passive mitigation measures were not utilized. The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability. This facility is located in an urban setting.

This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  \n\nThe Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous materials agency notification and procedures.
