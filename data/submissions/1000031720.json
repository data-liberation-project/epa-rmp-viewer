Mercer Foods has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours. State regulations require reporting when there is a significant release or a threat of a significant release of ammonia or other hazardous material.  Mercer Foods interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.

The General Manager, Engineering Manager, Safety Manager and the Maintenance Manager are to be called if not on site for support.  Incidential releases will be  handled in house. Substantial releases will be handled jointly between Mercer Foods and local responders.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to startup of modified or new processes. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment and process.\r\n\r\nThere are additional full time Managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately. An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks.

In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nA-4\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nMercer Foods Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Mercer Foods is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of Mercer Foods Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\r\n\r\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Mercer Foods.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\r\n\r\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.) \r\n\r\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\nSecond, all Mercer Foods employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\r\n\r\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Mercer Foods's Management of Change Procedure. \r\n \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Mercer Foods has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Mercer Foods Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \r\n\r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.)\r\n\r\n7) Verification of Mercer Foods's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.

At a minimum, these must be completed every three years. Resubmission of the RMP shall be done according to requirements.\r\n\r\nSee the Prevention Program Element 8 for the complete guidelines. The supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Mercer Foods Office.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nAn incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\r\n\r\nSee the Prevention Program Element 9 for the complete guidelines.

As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\r\n\r\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire dep"

Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\r\n\r\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site.  Incidental releases can be brought under control immediately. \r\n \r\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down or isolation valves and controls for the system, component or zone with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified at the facility.  \r\n\r\nFor Hazardous Materials Responders do not enter an IDLH condition. Responders are trained to the Air Purifying Respirator level and trained to retreat at (300 PPM or less) for ammonia. Facility responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases. All visitors, drivers and contractors will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for by the area supervisor and or person visited. Personnel not trained to respond will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for by area supervisors or managers\r\n\r\nThe Federal and Cali"
