      "SummaryText": "Nu-Gro Facility\n\nNu-Gro Technologies is located in the Glove Cities Industrial Park in the City of Gloversville, Fulton County New York.  The plant produces the nitrogen component of agricultural fertilizer by reaction of a urea-formaldehyde concentrate solution (UFC-85) with sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide.   The only substance  regulated by 40 CFR 68 above the threshold limit at the facility is UFC - 85 which contains formaldehyde which is at 30% concentration by weight.  If the tank containing UFC - 85 (Tank #2209) is at  full working capacity of 15,876 gallons, 52,500 pounds of formaldehyde could be present. Current practice is to maintain 8,000 gallons of UFC - 85 (26,421 pounds of formaldehyde) in the tank.  Tank #2209 is protected by a dike and a dedicated enclosed containment room separated from the rest of the plant.\n\nOverall Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nNu-Gro is aware of the properties of UFC - 85 and practices for storing this material as described in the MSDS sheets and recommended practices provided by our supplier.  We are  firmly committed to following these practices and applicable government regulations to maintain a safe and healthful working environment for our employees and the public. To this end, Nu-Gro Technologies Inc.  provides training, education, information, equipment and controls necessary to safely use UFC - 85.  We have an appropriate response program in the event that a spill may occur.\n\nOur prevention program has be written and given to employees  to prevent or minimize the consequences of a release.  It is based on Part 1910.119 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR 68 and New York State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations 6 NYCRR 595 -599.  Specific written elements include: a formaldehyde training program; spill reporting/response guidelines; plant safety practices; hazard communication for on-site contractors; respiratory protection; procedures for control hazardous energy source"

      "SummaryText": "s; hot work permits; management of change; confined space entry; personal protective equipment and emergency action and response plans.\n\nFive-Year Spill History\n\nIn the last 5 years we have not had a release of UFC -85 into the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThere is an emergency response program in place that, in the event of a spill, outlines procedures to notify in-plant personnel, minimize and clean up the spill and to determine what authorities need to be notified and appropriate time frames.  Also addressed are health and safety isues such as first aid, medical procedures, personal protective equimpemnt and training.  Coordinating efforts have been established with the local emergency planning committee and the local emergency response coordinator.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nIn May 2004 a more accurate level controller for Tank #2209 was replaced.  Additional safety measures planned include; Environmental Compliance and Due Diligence Assessments by 12/04.  Nu-Gro follows up on all audit findings. These audits are performed every 3 years. Equipment inspections are performed annually.  Updating the Spill Prevention Report required by New York State is planned for 2004."
