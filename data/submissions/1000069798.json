Three portions are included in this assessment.\n\n\n\n4.1     Worst Case Scenario - The worst Case Scenario, as defined by the EPA; \"the owner/operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.\"   \n\n        Atmospheric dispersion modeling has been performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia before its concentration decreases to the toxic end point of 0.14mg/L. \n\n\n\n4.2     Alternative Case Scenario - The alternative case scenario was performed as above with the exception that the alternative case involves a relief valve release of 434 lbs over a 10 minute period. The result of this evaluation was a \n\n        radius of 0.08 miles with an affected population of 0. Please refer to the alternative case section for specific details.\n\n\n\n4.3     Five Year Accident History - None.\n\n\n\n5.0    Accident Prevention Program - SuperValu Penn - Harrisburg Facility is in full compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management guidelines for the method of Accident Prevention. The Accident Prevention and PSM Programs emphasize: \n\n        operator training, preventative maintenance, state of the art equipment, use of accurate operating procedures, hazard reviews of the system, ammonia awareness, proper auditing program and inspection programs.\n\n\n\n6.0    Emergen"

The facility is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by a computer system that dials out to the owners and refrigeration service company if \n\n        any parameters are violated. The refrigeration service company performs monthly walkthroughs of the facility and has the ability to dial into the control system to monitor the refrigeration system remotely. The emergency action \n\n        plan is reviewed annually and all parties are to be informed of any facility changes.\n\n\n\n"
