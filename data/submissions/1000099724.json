      "SummaryText": "Superior Pipeline Kansas, LLC. (SPK) owns and operates a natural gas processing and liquids recovery facility, the Cheney Gas Processing Plant, in Kingman County, KS. The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, refrigeration, and expansion. Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas. Section 112(r ) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Reeding plant because it handles and stores process flammables such as ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane in excess of threshold quantities. \n\n\n\nSPK management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. The Cheney plant is has no recordable accidents in the past five years. SPK has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident. In this case, the \"worst case\" would be a complete release from the SV-4 Condensate Tank storage tank, resulting in instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes. Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the potential radius of impact, due to the explosion, was calculated to extend three-tenths (0.3) of a mile. Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 0.3 mile radius. The worst case event would affect (2) nearby residential structures. A consideration of the 0.3 mile radius is incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. \n\n\n\nSPK implements safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are implemented. In addition, SPK has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Kingman County Emergency Planning Committee. Cheney Plant personnel and responders are required to participate in facility-specific training. With"
