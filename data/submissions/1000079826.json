      "SummaryText": "The Plan describes procedures implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Agribusiness Division (\"Wilbur-Ellis\") to prevent accidental releases of ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 599 C Street in Walla Walla, Washington (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons each that are operated in tandem.  The contents of the tanks are transferred to tender trucks and are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  Approximately 75% of the anhydrous ammonia stored onsite is used in a blending process for the production of aqueous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThere are four aqueous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility, each with a capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons.  The contents of the tanks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer. \r\n\r\nGene"

      "SummaryText": "ral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n  \r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Walla Walla Fire Department #4 (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tProcedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\r\n2.\tInformation on emergency"

The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\r\n\r\n1. Implement PHA recommendations for the aqua ammonia process.\r\n2. Implement testing in accordance with a testing Standard and schedule presented in the RMP Mechanical Integrity Program. \r\n3. Update PSI for all relief valves including mobile containers. \r\n4. Conduct relief analysis for mobile pressure vessels. \r\n5. Review procedures for filling of mobile PV's. \r\n6. Install HRV with a start to discharge pressure of 350 psig between valves LSJ3, L13, and L15. \r\n7. Construct a proper bypass system in accord with the CGA standard and manufacturer recommendations. \r\n8. Install pressure gauge on discharge side of the pump. \r\n9. Review operating procedures for accuracy and add consequences of deviation and steps to avoid deviation. \r\n10. Update P&ID and prepare MOC documentation for changes that have occurred and the changes occurring from PHA. \r\n11. Review written mechanical integrity program. \r\n12. Add first aid instructions for exposure to anhydrous ammonia to the Operating Procedures under those parts of hte procedure that address \"Health and Safety Considerations\" per the regulation. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture.
