Flammables: Alternative Release.\n\nThe Hannibal plant has a well-established accident prevention program. The primary purpose of the program is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property loss and environmental or community impact. The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure reliable and predictable operations. The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected events. The program consists of four fundamental elements: (1) written procedures; (2) training; (3) auditing; (4) process reviews or evaluation.\n\n(1) The written procedures include personal health and safety, work practices, equipment operation, loss prevention, and related topics. The procedures are implemented using administrative, engineering and personal protective equipment controls. The procedures receive periodic review and are revised as necessary.\n\n(2) The training element includes job specific safety, emergency response and hazard awareness training. Training plans are specifically developed for various employee groups. The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\n\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits.  Internal audits are completed using a wide range of plant resources.  Plant personnel conduct routine general inspections of plant facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Facility personnel conduct extended plant-wide audits at a minimum three-year frequency.   These audits include safety, housekeeping, transportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections.  Corporate and Division staff, state and federal agencies, insurance companies, etc. conduct external audits.\n\n(4) Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each manufacturing and r"

      "SummaryText": "(Br2), phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) & phosphorus trichloride (PCl3): The same release scenario was assumed for each of these materials. It was assumed that while unloading a tank truck, the unloading hose fails due to the movement of the tank truck due to improper job set up. It was also assumed that a continuously evaporating pool formed in the diked area. The distance to the EPA toxic endpoints were estimated using RMP*Comp (tm) version 1.06. See Section 3. Toxics: Alternative Release.\n\nAlternative scenario - chlorine: It was assumed that a single chlorine cylinder is involved in a forklift truck accident. (A forklift truck is used to transport chlorine cylinders from the cylinder storage area to the chlorine dispensing system.) It was also assumed that the cylinder is damaged causing the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint was estimated using RMP*Comp (tm) version 1.06. See Section 3. Toxics: Alternative Release.\n\nRelease scenarios - Flammable substances\n\nWorst case scenario - ethyl mercaptan: For this scenario, it was assumed that all eight tank cars of ethyl mercaptan (which may be in inventory) are stored adjacent to each other and are involved in a common incident. In addition, it was assumed that this incident causes the simultaneous release of the mercaptan from all tank cars.  It was further assumed that the total inventory (1,100,000 pounds) is vaporized and undergoes a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to an EPA endpoint of 1 psi overpressure was estimated using RMP*Comp (tm). See Section 4. Flammables: Worst Case.\n\nAlternative scenario - ethyl mercaptan: For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that a fully loaded tank car is derailed and rolls over.  It was further assumed that manway on the railcar was improperly secured. The manway fails releasing the entire tankcar load of ethyl mercaptan (140,000 pounds). It was also assumed that ethyl mercaptan forms a pool that is ignited forming a pool fire. The"

Selected management of change activities also requires a hazard analysis. The analyses evaluate the impact of unexpected events to both in-plant and off-plant receptors.\n\nFive-year accident history: The plant maintains records of all chemical releases. Our records document that we have had no accidental releases of the RMP-listed substances meeting the RMP rule criteria for the past five years.\n\nThe plant also has a well-established emergency response plan. Its primary purpose is to guide plant personnel during emergency situations. The secondary purpose is to communicate to the surrounding communities and area response agencies how the facility intends to respond to potential emergency situations. The plan's objective is to provide a coordinated response to potential plant emergencies that could threaten employee health and safety, the local community, the environment or plant property.\n\nThe plant maintains experienced personnel who are fully trained to respond to potential emergencies arising from fires, hazardous material releases, and medical emergencies and confined space incidents. The various teams are equipped to respond to plant emergencies.  The plant recognizes the potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency situations. Therefore, plant emergency response teams work closely with members of the Palmyra, Hannibal, Quincy and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing plant response information, conducting joint training exercises, providing emergency response support to communities for incidents not related to plant activities, and in many areas participating in local voluntary response agencies.\n\nThe Hannibal Plant has an effective safety program as indicated by its excellent safety performance record.

TMA is transferred to the chemical process to make an intermediate for an agricultural product. The total plant inventory is 280,000 pounds.\n\nRelease scenarios - Toxic substances\n\nWorst case scenario - bromine: For the worst case scenario, we assumed a total failure of the storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed which would release 95,000 pounds of bromine. (Active mitigation systems were not considered according to EPA guidelines for worst cases.) Although the storage tank is designed to store approximately 110,000 pounds, plant administrative controls limit the amount to 95,000 pounds.  For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire tank contents (at 100 degrees F) are released to the secondary containment area (diked area). The EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) version 1.06 was used to estimate the distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint - see Section 2. Toxics: Worst Case.\n\nAlternative scenario - ammonia: For the alternative scenario it was assumed that while unloading a tank truck, the liquid ammonia unloading hose fails due to movement of the tank truck.  It was assumed that the truck was improperly set up for unloading.  Additionally, it was assumed that all systems designed to prevent ammonia release operated except the excess flow valve in the liquid line connected to the flexible hose.  It was estimated that 14,000 pounds of ammonia would be released.  The Plant's ability to use the firewater system to knock down and dissolve ammonia vapors was not assumed as active mitigation for this scenario even though the system is designed for use in this type of incident.
