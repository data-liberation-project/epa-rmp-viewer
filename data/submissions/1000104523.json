      "SummaryText": "connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons.\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s). The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved. These events are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\nA complete tank failure is highly unlikely.   \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nThe Andersons, Inc - Union City site has an installed excess flow valve that is located on the storage tanks . The valve closes automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate. The excess valve will not reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat. Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or leaking downstream pipe.\n\nPressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks and fixed steel piping to\nrelieve pressure that is too great. This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or\noverfilling. The pressure relief valves open directly to the atmosphere at 250 PSIG and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\nAn emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the bulk storage tanks activates the\nemergency shutoff valves. This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a large water tank  next to the bulk storage tanks. \n\n he Andersons personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank \n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program. All\nhoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the spring and fall season. A"

      "SummaryText": "The Andersons, Inc - Union City site is located in a rural area of Randolph County, 2.5 miles south of Union City, IN.  \n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons, Inc - Union City site is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies. This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since November of 2022. \n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. Three 12,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of the material. The tanks are located on the south side of the facility, away from any buildings. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 30,600 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. The facility also owns (11) 1465 gallon and (37) 1000 gallon nurse tanks  for a combined nurse tank quantity of 45,145 gallons held in nurse tanks. This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure. It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard. Ammonia is a toxic material, but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body. However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes. Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery truck to the bulk storage tank or a transfer from the loading station to the small application tanks (aka nurse wagons). Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly. Hoses are dated and replaced on a maintained schedule.\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel\npipes  with some braided steel hose, all of which comply with ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and are manually controlled. Flexible hoses are used to"
