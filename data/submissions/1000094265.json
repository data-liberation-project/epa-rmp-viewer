Process hazards will be evaluated during the PHA based on the nature of the chemicals involved (such as toxicity, flammability, etc.), the process conditions (i.e., flow, temperature, pressure, and composition), the team's experience, and the information about previous incidents in the plant (and/or at other sites).  Hazards associated with non-routine operations (such as startup, shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and temporary operations, if any) will also be studied.\r\n\u00bf\tPrevious Incidents\r\nAny past incidents or near misses that had a likely potential for catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical should be identified and discussed by the PHA team.  Prior to the PHA study, relevant incident investigation reports filed within the past five years should be collected to prepare a list of past incidents and near misses that had a potential for catastrophic consequences.  These incidents will then be analyzed during the study to evaluate the findings as well as the originally suggested remedies.\r\n\u00bf\tEngineering and Administrative Controls\r\nThe engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships will be addressed during the PHA and documented under safeguards as existing safeguards in the worksheets. Such controls include appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases; inventory reduction; substitution of less hazardous materials; protective systems such"

Such consequences, associated with failure of engineering and administrative controls, may result in the release of hazardous chemicals, which may result in the following:\r\n\u00bf\tPotential personnel injury\r\n\u00bf\tEquipment damage or loss of equipment\r\n\u00bf\tLoss of plant\r\n\u00bf\tLoss of production\r\n\u00bf\tImpacts on public safety.\r\n\u00bf\tEnvironmental impacts\r\n\u00bf\tOperability problems\r\n\r\nConsequences discussed during the study will be limited to employee protection and protection of the environment.  For deviations potentially resulting in significant consequences, the team should consider the need for specific and reliable safeguards.  Palmetto Pedic uses a matrix approach to determine the priority to be placed on an action associated with each failure event. The priority is based on the severity of the consequences of a particular failure and the likelihood that an event will take place.  The matrix will result in a priority ranking for recommendations associated with each failure resulting in recommendations. The matrix will be developed by the PHA team and agreed upon prior to the start of the PHA. The matrix will be documented in the PHA report.\r\n3.3.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis Documentation and Follow-up\r\nPHA action items and follow-up recommendations will be tracked using spreadsheets.
