The 630,000 sq ft plant is on a 59 acre plot in the stockyards industrial complex which is refrigerated with a 120,000 pound anhydrous ammonia system.  This state of the art system is operated 24/7 by experienced, licensed refrigeration management and operators. \n\nOver one half of the plant is protected by an automatic sprinkler system where flammables and combusible materials are either used or stored.  The balance of the facility is of concrete and metal construction.  The sprinkler system is monitored by a remote alarm system which is supervised by security personnel which are on site 24/7.  \n\nThe plant has a Waste Water Pre-Treatment Plant on site to ensure all waste water is within St. Joseph Waste Water Permit specifications before being released to the city waste water system.  Storm water runoff is managed by the use of detention ponds on the site. \n\nAll employees are trained per OSHA, EPA regulations and other mandated industrial standards, including Hazards Communications which instructs employees on the particular hazards and proper handling of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals used in the plant.  Particular emphasis is placed on the reporting of spills and releases or any other unusual events.\n\nTriumph Foods has written emergency action and response plans which identify potential emergencies and the steps to be taken to safetly remove all employees from harms way in the event incidents should arise.  A Health Services Department is staffed by nurses on both production shifts and supplemented with designated First Aid/CPR/AED responders throughout all departments and shifts to provide medical for employees.\n\nEmergency declaration is done via radio and/or telephone to designated Emergency Coordinators, w"

Plant Emergency Response Team members receive additional training for; Incident Command, 24 Hr HAZWOPER Technician, Confined Space Rescue, High Angle Rescue, and First Aid/CPR/AED. \n\nTriumph Foods does not have a Fire Brigade on site, but the Saint Joseph Fire Department's Station #2 is within one-half mile from the plant, and Station #1 is within three miles.\n\nThe plants Emergency Action and Response Plans are shared with the Saint Joseph Fire Department, Northwest Missouri Region H Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the St. Joseph/ Buchanan Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Triumph Foods will host any emergency response agency wishing to tour the facility and will schedule joint response drills periodically.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nAs this is a new facility, there are not NH3 related injuries to report.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nContinued training as listed above, plus cooperative efforts with local and regional ERS."
