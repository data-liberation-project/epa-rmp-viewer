This sommittment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental relase prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated sustances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.  Our facility's primary activities encompass Semi-conductor grade hydrochloric acid and zinc diakyldithiophosphates.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Hydrochloric Acid, and Furan.  Chlorine is used for making hydrochloric acic.  Hydrochloric acid is used for strictly to ship as a finished product to customers.  Furan is used for pyrrole and n-mehtyl pyrrole.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 540,000 pounds, hydrochloric acid maximum inventory is 800,000 pounds, and furan has a maximum inventory of 40,000 pounds. \n \n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Senarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comply.  The following provides details of the chosen scenarios.  \nThe worst case release scenario submitted for program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of chlorine storage and handling system.  In this scenario, 180,000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity is 100% of a rail car.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic"

An estimated 160,000 people mayl be affected by this release.    \nThe worst case scenario for furan involves a release of 40,000 pounds from the storage tank of furan.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1000 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike that is 238 square feet and 3.3 feet high is taken into account to calculate this scenario.  This dike has the effect of controlling the spread of the liquid.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0012 mg/L.  An estimated 81,000 people may be affected by this type of release.  \nThe worst case scenario for hydrochloric acid involves a release of 300,000 pounds from the storage tank of hydrochloric acid.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 694 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike that is 1200 square feet and 2.5 feet high is taken into account to calculate this scenario.  This dike has the effect of controlling the spread of the liquid.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 4.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L.  An estimated 33,000 people may be attected by this type of release.  \nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine involves a release from chrlorine storage and handling system.  The scenario involves the release of 8,000 pounds of chlorine.  The chlorine is assumed to evaporate during one minute from a burst pipe during transfer.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems.  At class D atomospheric stability and wind speed of 3 m/s,  the maximum distance of 3.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.

The acid will spill into a dike that is 1200 square feet and 2.5 feet high to contain the material.  It will take 240 minutes for the liquid to evaporate.

The General Accidental Release Prvention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDetrex Chemicals Division maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  Th"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularyly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining\nDetrex Chemicals Division has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nDetrex Chemicals Division carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: Pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  These personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Detrex Chemical Division to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 1, 2003.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\nCompliance Audits\nDetrex conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on May 12, 2003.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \n\nIncident Investigation\nDetrex promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years. \n\nEmployee Participation\nDetrex truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Emergency Response Plan\nDetrex has a written emergency response pland to deal with accidental release of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response inculding outside agencies, when necessary,  to provide first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post incident decontamination of affected areas.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  \nAshtabula County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committe (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.
