Helena\u00bfs Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance are fundamental parts of every Helena Chemical Company employee\u00bfs job.  Helena\u00bfs spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If such a release does occur, Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Helena protects the safety of employees, the nearby community, and the environment.\n\n1.2  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nThe primary activity at the Helena Chemical Company Centralia, Kansas Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to end users.  As defined in 40 CFR 68.3, a stationary source means any buildings, structures, equipment, installations, or substance-emitting stationary activities which belong to the same industrial group, which are located on one or more contiguous properties, from which an accidental release may occur.  The Facility receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia for direct application and blending for mixed-grade fertilizers used for crop production nutrients.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 250,000 pounds (lbs.) stored in anhydrous ammonia bulk storage tanks, nurse tanks, application tanks, and rail"

This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source.\n\n   1.3.1  Safety Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  The Facility inspects the anhydrous ammonia bulk storage tanks, nurse tanks, application tanks, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps on a monthly basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n   1.3.2  Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities associated with anhydrous ammonia, the Facility maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is readily accessible to employees.\n\n   1.3.3  Training\n\nThe Facility has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent"

In addition, employees not operating the anhydrous ammonia process are involved in safety training on the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n   1.3.4  Maintenance\n\nThe Facility performs maintenance checks on anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer equipment to ensure proper functions.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n   1.3.5  Incident Investigation\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  The anhydrous ammonia spill release reporting procedures are found in the Emergency Action Plan spill procedures.  Report forms will be completed in the event of an incident or possible incident.\n\n   1.3.6  Compliance Audits \n\nThe Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are performed at least every 3 years as required by 40 CFR 68.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n1.4  Five-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\nDue to release prevention policies, the Facility has not had a reportable accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years previous to June 21, 1999, the effective date of the RMP regulation.\n\n1.5  Emergency Response Plan (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (Emergency Action Plan).  The Emergency Action Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of an anhydrous ammonia accidental release.  Aspects o"

A site map, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), and a list of chemicals kept on the site are included in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n1.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(g))\n\nMechanical integrity checks, maintenance checks, compliance audits, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.  The Facility has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety regarding the anhydrous ammonia process when necessary."
