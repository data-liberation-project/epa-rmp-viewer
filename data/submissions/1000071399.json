In addition, Lawson Products, Inc. coordinates emergency response measures with the Reno Fire Department. Lawson Products contracts FM Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting. At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events. Lawson Products utilizes the following: Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Hazardous Communication Program and Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nLawson Products, Inc. is an industrial distributor of maintenance and repair supplies, distributing products from our 105,000 square-foot facility in Reno, Nevada. The Reno distribution center consists of administration offices, warehouse storages, and shipping areas.

There is a fire monitoring system 24/7 in the facility for a potential event.\n\nSome aerosol products stored in Reno facility contain flammable propellants which are regulated under the RMP Rule if handled, manufactured or stored in a process at a facility in a quantity greater than its listed threshold quantity. The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. The warehouse facility constitutes a single process. The warehouse stores greater than 10,000 pounds of butane and propane in aerosol products.\n\nThe aerosol products are typically in metal containers, with the maximum size of aerosol can is 24-ounce.\n\nThe average weight of these aerosol products is 17.28 oz. and the average amount of propellant in each can is 14%. Per EPA Helpline, the worst case scenario was clarified as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single aerosol can. The worst case scenario was based on one 18 oz. aerosol can containing 15% of propane and 15% of butane. The quantity released in a vapor cloud explosion would not affect any residential population or public receptor or have any off-site consequences.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nLawson's Reno facility is subject to OSHA PSM rule. Lawson Products, Inc. is ISO 9001 certified company, and internal and external audits are performed regularly.\n\nLawson Products, Inc. has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards. We take a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\n\n- ERP\n\n-    Standard work instructions - Daily pre-startup meeting - Job hazard analysis /job safety analysis\n\n-    Compliance audits\n\n- Regular facility inspections (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annual)\n\n- Operating procedures - Accident investigation\n\n-    Tr"

Our fire pump and sprinkler systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nLawson's Reno facility has no history of accidental releases. Lawson Products, Inc. certifies in the RMP submission to the EPA that during the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred involving regulated flammable substances from the warehousing of aerosol products.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nLawson Products, Inc. has an emergency response plan which details procedures to follow in response to an accidental release and other emergencies.
