There is a fire monitoring system 24/7 in the facility for a potential event.\r\nSome aerosol products stored in Reno facility contain flammable propellants which are regulated under the RMP Rule if handled, manufactured or stored in a process at a facility in a quantity greater than its listed threshold quantity. The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. The warehouse facility constitutes a single process. The warehouse stores greater than 10,000 pounds of butane and propane in aerosol products.\r\nThe aerosol products are typically in metal containers, with the maximum size of aerosol can is 24-ounce.\r\nThe average weight of these aerosol products is 17.28 oz. and the average amount of propellant in each can is 14%. Per EPA Helpline, the worst case scenario was clarified as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single aerosol can. The worst case scenario was based on one 18 oz. aerosol can containing 15% of propane and 15% of butane. The quantity released in a vapor cloud explosion would not affect any residential population or public receptor or have any off-site consequences.\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nLawson's Reno facility is subject to OSHA PSM rule. Lawson Products, Inc. is ISO 9001 certified company, and internal and external audits are performed regularly.\r\nLawson Products, Inc. has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards. We take a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\r\n- ERP\r\n-\tStandard work instructions - Daily pre-startup meeting - Job hazard analysis /job safety analysis\r\n-\tCompliance audits\r\n- Regular facility inspections (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annual)\r\n- Operating procedures - Accident investigation\r\n-\tTr"
