A Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system has been installed and continually monitors each unit in the process as well by personnel stationed at the facility.  All employees are thouroughly trained on the characteristics and safe handling procedures for liquified natural gas. Access is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. Marathon Oil has implemented a variety of safe work practices and procedures to minimize risk to the employees and surrounding neighbors."

      "SummaryText": "Natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility via pipeline from several Central Production Facilities.  The natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility through a pig trap and a multi-finger slug catcher.  Gas from the slug catcher is compressed by one of four single staged flow-through compressors, dehydrated by one of two glycol dehydration units then sent to multiple sales points via two sales scrubbers.  The liquids from the slug catcher are routed to the liquids side of the process where any water is separated from the liquids.  The liquids flow through a caustic wash system to remove H2S, and a carbon filtration unit to treat the color (if needed) for pipeline quality purposes. The resulting NGL is then stored in pressurized bullet tanks prior to exiting the facility via pipeline (the normal operation mode after June 2013), or by truck (used during periods of pipeline shutdowns) to a third party gas plant for further processing.  Additionally in January 2014 Marathon began processing stabilized NGL's received from a third party (Murphy).  These third party NGL's are hauled to the plant via truck.  They are unloaded into a pressurized tank and then are introduced into the Marathon process and are commingled with Marathons production (described above).  NGL's is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Because NGL's are pressurized flammable gas, it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent fire/explosion risks and reduce health threats to our workers and neighbors.  Marathon has implemented various health and safety programs and processes and will strictly adhere to all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.   \r\n\r\nSafety depends on:\t\t\r\n(a) The manner in which we handle this product\t\t\r\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility\t\t\r\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures, and \t\t\r\n(d) Employee training\t\r\n\r\nMarathon Eagle Ford Asset Team's emergency response program details employee responsibilities"
