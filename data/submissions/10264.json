A PSM/RMP audit was conducted in February 1999.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Roundup PSM/RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."

      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC) Roundup Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Extraction Facility.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Roundup PSM/RMP manual for the LPG, drip gas, and propane system. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.  Additionally, PSC has determined that, despite qualification for Program 2 compliance, it is prudent to establish and maintain Program 3 compliance as a conservative safety and business approach.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nRoundup is a natural gas liquids extraction facility designed to process 40 mmscfd of natural gas.  The purpose of the Roundup NGL Extraction Facility is to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission.  Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas is water-saturated in many cases.  The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) in the inlet gas increases.  As gas flows through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding ground.  If this te"

For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (the LPG product storage gas tank or 48,576 pounds of LPG) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  Reference Table 9 of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance (dated May 24, 1996) was used to determine the distance to overpressure of 1.0 psi for a vapor cloud explosion of hydrocarbon product.  A distance of 0.30 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 48,576 pounds in ten minutes.  The RMP*Comp model also predicted the same distance to the flammable endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was developed based on discussions at the process hazard analysis and consists of a release of 2777 pounds of LPG from the LPG product storage tank over a one-hour period due to continued release (and potential failure open) from a 5/16 inch relief valve on the tank.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  The ALOHA air dispersion model was used to determine the volume of LPG that would be released in sixty minutes, and Reference Table 9 of the RMP OCA Guidance was used to calculate the distance to overpressure of 1.0 psi.  A distance of 0.05 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for LPG, Drip Gas, and Propane\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Roundup PSM/"

The resulting buildup of hydrates can begin to restrict process flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, the hydrates may even form a potentially dangerous ice plug.\n\nIn order to reduce the dew point of the gas (and accordingly, minimize the formation of hydrates), the inlet gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system.  This process allows the heavy hydrocarbons and water to condense out of the process flow.  Ethylene glycol is spray-injected into the inlet gas at each heat exchanger to absorb the condensed water.  Ethylene glycol, condensed liquid hydrocarbons, and residue gas are then separated in a cold separator.  The lower the temperature in the separator, the greater the volume of liquid extracted, which also lowers the dew point of the residue gas.  The ethylene glycol is circulated through a reboiler to drive off condensate, and then it is circulated to the separator.  Condensed hydrocarbons are then stored.  The residual gas is at its dew point when it leaves the cold separator and is then delivered to the transmission pipeline.\n\nThe PSM/RMP-regulated substances handled at this facility are LPG, drip gas, and propane.  Following is a breakdown of the locations of these materials at Roundup:\n\nNGL Plant Propane System:  Maximum Volume = 500 gallons       Maximum Weight = 2530 lbs.\nPropane Makeup Tank:          Maximum Volume = 800 gallons       Maximum Weight = 4048 lbs.\nLPG Product System:            Maximum Volume = 150 gallons       Maximum Weight = 759 lbs.\nLPG Product Storage:           Maximum Volume = 9600 gallons     Maximum Weight = 48,576 lbs.\nDrip Gas:                               Maximum Volume = 5000 gallons     Maximum Weight = 25,300 lbs.\n                                              \nThe propane and liquid hydrocarbon system is the only covered process at this time at the Roundup Gas Storage Facility.
