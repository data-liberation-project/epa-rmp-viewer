      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC) Comanche Station.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Comanche Station PSM/RMP manual for the chlorine system. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nComanche Station is a coal-burning electric generating station.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling and process water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 4 containers (8,000 lbs.) on site.  The chlorinator rating for the existing system is 1000 ppd. \n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one-ton container of chlorine) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.

A distance of 3.0 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated for a release of 2000 pounds in ten minutes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of a release of 959 pounds of chlorine over a one-hour period due to a severed pigtail on the one-ton container.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.7 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Comanche Station Chlorine System PSM/RMP manual.  \n\nThe prevention program includes the following elements:\n\u00b7 Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant PSM/RMP program, as well as ready access to program information\n\u00b7 Process safety information, which has been collected in the Comanche Station Document Storage Room and summarized in the PSM/RMP manual\n\u00b7 Process hazard analyses (PHAs) - The initial PHA for the chlorine system was conducted in 1994;  the inital PHA was updated in February 1997.

      "SummaryText": "the container for transport, but the release was reported to the National Response Center and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.  An incident investigation was conducted, and indicated that additional operator training for connecting the containers to the manifold should be performed and that an evaluation of the connections to the chlorine container be conducted to determine if they needed to be modified.  These recommendations have been addressed.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Comanche Station PSM/RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
