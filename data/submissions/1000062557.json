(MarkWest) - Boldman facility located in Pikeville, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Pike County, Kentucky Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction.  NGL is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  The flammable substance is a mixture comprised of propane, butane, isobutene, and natural gasoline (mostly pentanes and hexanes). \n\n\n\nThe NGL is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline.  Once extracted, the NGL is stored in two 60,000 gallon capacity pressure vessels (A11 and A12).  The Y-grade is then transferred offsite via tank truck.\n\n\n\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 80% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filed to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessel and lead to a release.\n\n\n\nBased "

      "SummaryText": "on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory present at the facility would be equal to 80% of the total 120,000-gallon capacity: 96,000 gallons.  Using a Y-grade analysis collected on January 4, 2012 from the Langley facility and the specific gravity of each constituent yields 440,000 pounds of NGL.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables, and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be a complete rupture failure of the NGL storage tank leading to a complete loss of the product in the tank of 96,000 gallons (440,000 pounds).  The alternative-case scenario is described as a hose failure during loading of tanker trucks which would lead to a release.  This release is described as a five-minute release until the valves are completely shut off, which would lead to up to 1,000 gallons (4,400 pounds) of Y-grade being released.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative-case radius of impact were determined using the EPA RMP-COMP model.  Populations within that radius were determined using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS), Version 10c using data from Summary File 1, 2010 Census and by inputing the coordinate points and the radius of influence.  \n\n\n\n4.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\n    Steps\n\n\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  The propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline, and NGL storage and distribution processes at MarkWest are subject to the Occupational Safety and He"

The \"What If?\" methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Conclusion\n\n\n\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C. has taken all necessary measures required by EPA and OSHA regulations to ensure the continued safe operations of the MarkWest - Boldman facility.  The Risk Management Plan provided herein summarizes the active release prevention program that is currently in place at the facility.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest's commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest's emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Pike County, Kentucky LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigated. \n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation of Calculations for March 2012 Revision\n\n\n\nTanks Included in the Plan\n\nThe tanks included in the RMP are 2 -60,000 gallon y-grade storage tanks 120,000 gallons; however, as noted below the capacity are administratively limited to 80% of the capacity of any one vessel for maximum total of 96,000 gallons on site.\n\n\n\nDetermination of Quantities\n\n\n\nThe following factors were used to determine the amount of regulated material stored on the site:\n\n-    Tanks will not be filled above 80% of capacity.\n\n-    Y-grade is a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, pentane and natural gasoline\n\n-    The mixture has a density of 4.422 lb/gallon and has the following weight percentage distribution based on analysis on January 4, 2012\n\no    C2 - 3.2738\n\no    C3 - 59.6132\n\no    IC4 - 5.5206\n\no    NC4 - 19.2567\n\no    IC5 - 3.2089\n\no    IC5 - 4.2944\n\no    C6+ - 4.8278 - not regulated under RMP\n\n-    Each tank is assumed to be at the maximum operating capacity\n\n-    Transfer hose will leak at a rate of 200 gal/min. for a total of 5 minutes\n\n\n\nDetermination of Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Scenarios\n\nAs the only tanks storing an RMP regulated substance, the y-grade storage tanks rupturing was considered the"
