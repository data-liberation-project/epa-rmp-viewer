The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 404 North 1st Street in Fairfield, Washington (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into tender trucks ranging in capacity from 1,000 gallons to 1,500 gallons.  There are of two tender trucks with three tanks (1,000 to 1,500 gallons each), two tender trucks with two tanks (1,000 gallons each), and four tender trucks with one tank (1,000 to 1,500 gallons each), with a maximum of 15,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia stored in tender trucks at the facility.  The contents of the tender trucks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nGener"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Fairfield Fire Department District #2 (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.

The Branch Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Install load-in valves on bulkhead for breakaway protection.\n\n2.    Evaluate installation of a remote-activated emergency shutdown system.\n\n3.    Evaluate installation of an emergency shutdown system which can be activated from the load out area used for tender trucks.\n\n4.    Evaluate potential installation of a fenced perimeter for added security.\n\n5.    Ensure that signage displaying emergency contact information is visible at the entrance of the facility.\n\n6.    Install barricades around the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks/loadout area to prevent impact from vehicular traffic.\n\n7.    Ensure that a fire extinguisher is stored in the immediate vicinity of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks/loading area.\n\n8.    Ensure that chock blocks are present and ready for use at the site."
