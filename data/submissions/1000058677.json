Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe City of Melrose, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant uses the chemical chlorine for the purpose of disinfection of drinking water. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The City of Melrose is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at our facility. It is our policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the safe handling procedures that we use combined with the safety devices included in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nIf a release of chlorine should occur, we are coordinated with the Melrose Emergency dispatcher and in turn the Melrose Fire Department and Emergency Operations Coordinator, who will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of an unforeseen release.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Melrose, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant has one regulated substance over RMP threshold quantities, chlorine, at the facility. Chlorine, a toxic gas stored under pressure as a liquid, is used for disinfection of the city's wastewater effluent.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility at any time is two 2,000 pound (1-ton) tanks and one 2,000 pound (1-ton) spare tank, for a total of 6,000 pounds (3-tons).\r\n\r\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenario, we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and RMP*Comp. For alternative release scenario analysis, the rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase rate was estimated by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. using the SAFER/TRACER model, Pamphlet 74, Edition 3, April 1998. The distance to endpoint is based on EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, Exhibit 4-12.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest chlorine storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor in an outdoor setting within 10 minutes of tank failure. An urban setting was chosen as the topographical setting. Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles corresponding to an endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (volume/volume) is reached. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario - An outdoor release of gas due to valve failure was considered for the alternative release scenario. It is assumed that mitigation occurs within one hour of the start of the release under neutral weather conditions. As in the worst-case scenario, an urban topographical setting was chosen. \r\n\r\nThe maximum distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (v/v) is 0.1 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. \r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Melrose, MN Water Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in 40 CFR part 68. The Plant is also in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine cylinders are handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. The facility is designed with a SO2 injection system in the event of an indoor chlorine delivery system release. Additionally, the facility's vacuum demand chlorine delivery system automatically stops the flow of chlorine if a vacuum loss occurs (e.g. a piping or valve failure)."

Employee participation and training is occurring.    \r\n\r\n5. Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Melrose, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant's current chlorine disinfection system (over the RMP threshold quantity) was installed in April 2016.  No accidental releases have occurred to date.  In addition, there were no documented accidental releases associated with the Plant's previous chlorine system (which was below the RMP threshold quantity).   \r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nEmergency Response by the Melrose, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant employees will be limited to incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Melrose Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. The Wastewater Treatment Plant's Emergency Response Plan is studied, practiced, and updated as needed."
