The bulk of our business is selling fertilizer to our crop producers which raise wheat , beans and milo.  The worst case scenario resulting in a rupture of our largest tank would release 132,000 pounds of NH3 effecting nearly 1200 patrons with a distance to endpoint of 2.5 miles.  Our employees are trained on a rotational 2-year basis where they attend a state conducted NH3 school.  They receive classroom training as well as a written test.
