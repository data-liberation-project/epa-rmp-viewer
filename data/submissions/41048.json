Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Chicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. - Bedford Park are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as hazardous materials segregation procedures, material handling equipment maintenance, and employee training associated with storage of hazardous materials at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have three (3) regulated substances present at our facility:  hydrazine; hydrofluoric acid 70% aqueous solution; and peracetic acid.\n\nWe have varying inventories for these chemicals.  For this reason we are filing this RMP report under the predictive filing concept.  The maximum inventories for these chemicals are:  hydrazine 31,000 pounds, packaged in 55-gallon drums and 350-gallon IBC; hydrofluoric acid 70% aqueous solution 30,400 pounds, packaged in 55-gallon drums; and peracetic acid 36,400 pounds, packaged in 55-gallon drums.\n\nDrums are transported and stored in wooden pallets and secured with metal strips to protect a drum from falling from a pallet.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMPComp.  The worst case scenario will be a liquid spill and vaporization of the biggest container present in our warehouse.  A 350-gallon Intermediate Bulk Container or tote of hydrazine is our biggest container.  We are considering the building as passive mitigation for t"

      "SummaryText": "he calculation of the toxic endpoint.  The alternative scenario will be the release of hydrofluoric acid 70% from a plastic drum damaged with a forklift during handling operations.  For the calculations of the toxic endpoint we considered the same passive mitigation and a sprinkler system as active mitigation components available.  Our results from the worst case scenario indicate that we could have public receptors within the distance to the endpoint; therefore we are reporting a prevention program level 2 for our facility.  Public receptors were estimated using Landview III-Environmental Mapping Software.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program Level 2 and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards (MSDS) for the regulated substance.  The drums or tote-tanks used to transport hydrazine, hydrofluoric acid, and peracetic acid are manufactured according to DOT requirements at 49 CFR Part 178, Specifications for Plastic Drums and Specifications for Composite Drums (Metallic Drums).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our warehousing process were identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis was Industry Checklist, as recommended by CMA's Warehouse Assessment Protocol.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.

Refresher training is provided on an yearly basis and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on forklift equipment to ensure proper operations.  Materials handling equipment examined by these checks include forklifts.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our warehousing process that would require a modified emergency response."
