Major plant construction took place in the 1980s, with the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP) was completed in 1998.\r\n\r\nMonterey Regional Treatment Plant (RTP) has developed a risk management program to address the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program requirements (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) 40 CFR \u00a768).  The facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility's staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine in the wastewater treatment process. This is a RMP Program 3 facility.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nMonterey RTP has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine wastewater treatment process.  It is Monterey RTP's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nChlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process for odor control and disinfection.  Chlorine is supplied in one-ton containers. Containers, evaporators and chlorinators are contained inside a building equipped with a scrubber system.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that could potentially be stored at the RTP at any one time, is 30 tons.  \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one toxic worst-case analysis has been defined for the chlorine process.  The results can be"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook. \r\n\r\nOff-site Receptors\r\nRMP requirements state that sensitive populations such as schools, hospitals, day-care centers, long-term health care facilities, prisons, residential areas, public use parks/recreational areas, and major commercial facilities, located within the at risk area must be identified.  These sensitive populations include individuals who could not remove themselves from the exposure area without assistance. \r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the Monterey RTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an chlorine release:\r\n- The system has alarms \r\n- The system has scrubbers in place and interlocks\r\n- Exhaust gases from the chlorine building can be routed to the scrubber during an emergency.\r\n-Gas detectors\r\n-The system has relief valves and rupture discs\r\n-Emergency air supply\r\n-Emergency po"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  As chlorine is self alarming due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n- Management of Change\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Employee Participation\r\n- Hot Work Permit\r\n- Contractors\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no RMP applicable releases of flammable materials at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.
