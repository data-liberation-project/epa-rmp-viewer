In order to effectively implement these policies, ARP established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\nARP operates two bleached kraft pulp mills that employ approximately 540 full-time workers.  The two mill produce bleached kraft market pulp for sale to customers.  As part of this manufacturing process, ARP handles chlorine and chlorine dioxide in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nARP performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ARP does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like ARP and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  \n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by ARP.  The rule requires one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide, and one alternative release scenario for chlorine.  The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by ARP.\n\n1.3.1  Chlorine Dioxide Storage and Transfer\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the rupture of a 147,000 gallon of aqueous chlorine dioxide solution at a concentration of 10.5 grams per liter.  This scenario would result in the release of 12,873"

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nARP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  ARP trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the mill's fire department works with the City of Monroeville fire department and with the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

As part of this commitment, ARP has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Alabama River Pulp and Alabama Pine Pulp mills that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ARP.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program implemented by ARP.\n\nARP's risk management program consists of three elements:\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at ARP helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.  In fact, ARP has implemented a comprehensive safety program and established many levels of safeguards against release"

Several public receptors are located within this distance (e.g., the Alabama River, Claiborne Landing, the City of Monroeville, and Silver Creek Park).  One environmental receptor, Claude D. Kelley State Park, is located within this distance from the mill.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is a release from a chlorine dioxide transfer line to the bleach plant.  This scenario assumes that chlorine dioxide solution is spilled to the ground at a rate of 500 gallons per minute and requires 10 minutes before the transfer pump is deactivated.  The maximum distance to a toxic endpoint is 1.9 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 269 people live within this distance from the mill.  The Alabama River and several houses are located within this distance.
