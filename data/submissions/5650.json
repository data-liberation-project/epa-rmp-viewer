The Facility Policy.\nThe owners, management, and employees of AG Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 78000 pounds in our 18000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be th release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quqntity released would be 78000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 17 miles.\nfb.  The alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .1 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\na.  There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;nor to ourknowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\nThe facility has:\na.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to"
