The facility was expanded in 1998 to treat 11.5 million gallons per day of groundwater to help meet the City?s domestic water service demands.  A gaseous chlorine system is used at the Bailey WCF to oxidize the iron and manganese in the influent well water and to provide a chlorine residual for disinfection.  The facility is equipped with chlorine gas detectors and a chlorine gas scrubber system.\n\n\n\nThe facility normally operates without the presence of onsite personnel.  Operators and maintenance staff travel to the Bailey WCF from the City?s Operation Center at the Avenue Water Treatment Plant in Ventura.\n\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (RMP) RULE\n\n\n\nThe Bailey WCF uses chlorine in quantities above the federal RMP and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) thresholds.  One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are delivered to the WTP by truck.  Typically, the City stores a maximum of 9 one-ton chlorine cylinders onsite in a building equipped with gas detectors and an automatic emergency scrubber.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELESES DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had any releases in the past 5 years that resulted in fatality, injury, offsite evacuation or property damage.\n\n\n\nPROCES SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bailey WCF is subject to state and federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  The City has implemented a stringent PSM safety program that includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n* Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\n\n\n* Updates of standard operating procedures to include specific information on s"

The key elements of the Emergency Action Plan include:\n\n\n\n* All plant staff members (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n\n\n\n* The chlorine building is equipped with and electronic chlorine detector.  The chlorine detector has an audible alarm and alerts the City?s Central Operations control room in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\n* In the event of a large release, Central Operations would immediately contact the City of San Buenaventura Fire Department.\n\n\n\n* A team of City supervisors and operators are fully trained, certified, and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emerge"
