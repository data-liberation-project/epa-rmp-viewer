This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System.  Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nThe Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility is located at 11765 Mountainview, Kingsburg, California. 93631. The regulated substance at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia stored on site is used for controlling concentration of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the combustion flue gas from the boiler unit.  This solution is volatilized into anhydrous ammonia vapor prior to injection into the boiler.  The anhydrous ammonia is consumed by the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia inventory in the ammonia injection system at the facility is 9600 gallons (54,720 lbs.).  The amount of anhydrous ammonia corresponds to the 80% capacity of the ammonia storage tank, as the facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum filling of the tank to 80% of the capacity. \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n?Worst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nPer CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Injection System.

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014  Five Year Update Binder.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following:\n\n?Well Designed Relief System\n\n?Ammonia Detection, two detectors located in the ammonia storage tank area and one detector located in the Skid area.\n\n? Ammonia Alarms. There are two alarms; one is located inside the power house and a second alarm is located on the Distribution Control System (DCS).\n\n?Deluge System located on top of the ammonia storage tank.\n\n?Safety Showers/Eyewash Stations are available for Operators, if exposed to ammonia at the below locations.\n\noSouth-west corner of Control Emissions Management System (CEMS) building and one by Auxiliary MCC.\n\noInside /outside Power House east wall\n\n?Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used "

Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe total anhydrous ammonia inventory of the ammonia injection system at the facility is 9600 gallons (54,720 lbs.).  The amount of anhydrous ammonia corresponds to the 80% capacity of the ammonia storage tank, as the facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum filling of the tanks to 80% of the capacity. \n\n\n\nTherefore, the covered process has over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities, and over the 500-lb state threshold for CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, US EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.  \n\n\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?
