      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWESTERN PLAINS ENERGY, LLC\n\nWestern Plains Energy, LLC started operation in January 2004.  Since the commencement of operations, plans and records have been reviewed periodically.  There has been some turnover in staff, including management.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nWestern Plains Energy, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nWestern Plains Energy, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nWestern Plains Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located near Oakley, Gove County, Kansas.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Western Plains Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.60 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on-site.  \n\nOff-site Consequences Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud or a release of 560,000 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on-site.  The worst-case toxic cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant. Residence homes are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "For denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on-site.  The worst-case vapor cloud is approximately 0.70 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes are located within this 0.70 miles radius.\n\nAlthough Western Plains Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Alternative scenarios have also been determined for this process. \n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents or reportable spills for Western Plains Energy, LLC since the initiation of operations in 2004.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nWestern Plains Energy, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC has been prepared and implemented in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of the facility activities.  Western Plains Energy, LLC's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
