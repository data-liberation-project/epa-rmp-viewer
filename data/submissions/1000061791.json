Communications are established with Jefferson Parish's and St. Charles Parish's departments of emergency management, the City of Kenner fire department, Louisiana State Emergency Response, and others as needed. \r\n\r\nFortier responds to incidents with a facility Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responders Operations level. We have an automated system that can call to warn neighbors of emergency, as well as call in additional Cornerstone personnel if needed in the event of an emergency. We also have access to a parish-wide siren/message warning system, should it become necessary to notify neighboring residents of a plant emergency. Planned drills are used to test the procedures. Fortier also has mutual aid agreements with local agencies, which can assist in\r\nthe event of an emergency.\r\n \r\nThe Fortier Plant is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, and inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\r\n \r\nTITLE V AIR PERMITS\r\nCornerstone currently has four Title V Operating Permits as follows:\r\nFacility Permit I.D.\r\nAcrylonitrile Plant 2195 (V-6)\r\nAcid Plant 594 (V-4)\r\nMelamine Plant 1981 (V-4)\r\nUtilities Plant 2306 (V-4)\r\n \r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA) REVIEWS\r\nThe information submitted is true, accurate and complete as of January 26, 2017."
