      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\n\nIn accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, the City of Apple Valley has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Water Treatment Plant.  An RMP is required because over 2,500 pounds of chlorine is stored at the Water Treatment Plant.  The RMP is required to be updated and submitted to the EPA every five years.\n\nIn addition to the RMP, a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) is in place.  The PSM is required by OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM is required if over 1,500 pounds of chlorine is stored on site.  The PSM and RMP work hand in hand to prevent or minimize exposure to chlorine gas for the safety of Utilities Division employees and residents of Apple Valley.  A compliance audit of the PSM is required every three years and was last completed on April 2, 2003.\n\nThe Apple Valley Water Treatment Plant, constructed in 1989, has been safely treating the community?s drinking water supply for 15 years.  With the construction of the treatment plant, chlorine no longer needed to be maintained at each well site, which significantly decreased the amount of chlorine within the City used for water treatment.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant treats an average of 6.2 million gallons of water each day.  Approximately 128 pounds of chlorine are used daily to treat and disinfect the water supply.  Under normal operating conditions, 4,000 pounds of chlorine are stored in two 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders.  During peak summer operating conditions when water demands increase, 6,000 pounds of chlorine may be on site.  \n\nSafety is of utmost importance.  Chemical safety training by our chemical supplier is required to be done annually.  Simulated OSHA safety inspections are done periodically by the City?s safety consultant.  Employees are required to have a second standby person available whenever working with chlorine; for example, when changing chlorine cylinders.  Respirator and confined space t"

      "SummaryText": "raining is done annually for all Utilities Division employees.  Fire Department employees do monthly tests of the self-contained breathing apparatus at the facility and provide annual training for the Utilities Division.\n\nTo ensure safety, a daily visual inspection is made of the chlorine room, pre and post chlorinators, chlorine alarm, and overall facility.  Monthly, the inspection also includes the chlorine lines.  The chlorinator is inspected when a cylinder is changed.  Periodically, the chlorine lines are replaced.  An emergency backup generator is on site and capable of running the entire facility plus one well during power outages or emergency situations.\n\nNo significant chlorine releases have occurred.  In the unlikely event an emergency response would be required, the Apple Valley Fire Department is the emergency contact.  The Police Dispatch is the after hours and holiday emergency contact.  The Police Department is also familiar with the site and can provide emergency assistance.  \n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is included in the community emergency response plan.  In the event of a chlorine emergency, the Utilities Division would contact the Fire Department.  The Fire Department would assess the situation and, if necessary, contact the State Duty Officer.  The State Duty Officer would determine if a HAZMAT team needs to be notified.  The Fire Department, Duty Officer, and HAZMAT teams are trained in handling emergency situations involving hazardous materials.  They would also be responsible for mitigating the effects of a release and coordinating evacuation procedures when needed.\n\nIn accordance with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, a water system vulnerability assessment of security was done on the water system.  Recommended upgrades from the vulnerability assessment will be budgeted and implemented in the coming years.  These upgrades should help ensure the security of the Water Treatment Plant and chlorin"
