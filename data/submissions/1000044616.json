The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Pardis Fractionator is coordinated with Paradis Volunteer Fire Department.

The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.  \r\n\r\nThe Paradis Fractionator's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Paradis Fractionator processes a y-grade natural gas liquid into pure propane, iso-butane, butane, and natural gasoline. The raw material is received by pipeline and railcar. The finished products are delivered to pipelines, truck loading racks, and railcar loading racks.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe Paradis Fractionator has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Paradis Fractionator maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, ("

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR\u00bfs): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: Pardis Fractionator has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.  \r\n\r\nTraining: The plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensu"
