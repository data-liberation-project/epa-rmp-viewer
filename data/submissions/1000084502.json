The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is submitting the EPA RMP as a 5-year update.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Covered Process 1: NH3 Storage and Handling\n\n?    Covered Process 2: Base Blending\n\n?    Covered Process 3: Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Blending\n\n?    Covered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\n\n?    Covered Process 5: O-Phos Blending\n\n \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all five (5) covered processes.  The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 2, and 3), the worst case release was modeled as if a 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 4 and 5), the worst case release scenario assumes that the 20,300-gallon aqua amm"

      "SummaryText": "onia AST failed and instantaneously spills the content into secondary containment that has a total containment capacity of 17,625 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  Therefore, some of the aqueous ammonia spills over the containment and collects onto the ground.  For purposes of determining the impacted surface area adjacent to the containment, it was assumed that the aqueous ammonia covers the impacted areas to a depth of 1 cm.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Process 1; (2) rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose during transfer and blending at Covered Process 3; and (3) a leaking 2-inch process pipe during transfer and blending at Covered Process 2. The alternative scenario for Covered Process 4 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to the rupture of a transfer hose during a transfer operation and the alternative release scenario for Covered Process 5 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to break in the process piping between the liquid pump and Blender that occurs during a blending operation. Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety In"
