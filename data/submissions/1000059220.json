The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Herrin, LTD are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Buffalo Fire Dept., Sanagmon Co. LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be in our Two storage tank(2x 30,000) storage tanks our nurse tanks and up to 2 rail cars at our location. \n\n\n\n3.
