It is the intent of the Athens Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA # 58-2011 Edition) into this process. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Athens-Clarke County Fire and Emergency Services as well as the Athens-Clarke County Emergency Management Agency.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (\"National EMS\") and Athens Regional Medical Center.\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC - Athens Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one butane storage vessel.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate (potential for off-site impacts) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC - Athens Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

      "SummaryText": "em, this facility has never had an accident involving the butane process which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC - Athens Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Athens-Clarke County Fire and Emergency Services (Primary Responder) and request their assistance. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with fire department and the Athens-Clarke County Emergency Management Agency. The Athens-Clarke County Fire and Emergency Services has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, the Athens-Clarke County Fire and Emergency Services is contacted regarding participation in annual site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
