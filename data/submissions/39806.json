The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA Standards.  Processes at our facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.    The following sections briefly describe the main elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility. \n\n1. Employee Participation - all employees at ATOFINA Bayport are involved in our safety program.  ATOFINA believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees actively participate in accident prevention and development of our process safety management programs.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the Risk Management Plan rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n2. Process Safety Information (PSI) - ATOFINA maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our processes.  The information is kept current and is available to all employees.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Systems are in place to safely manage change as part of our process safety management program.   Comprehensive hazard reviews (where teams of employees examine potential hazards and develop ways to mitigate them) are performed to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed promptly.  \n\n4. Operating Procedu"

These procedures cover initial plant startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  They describe the tasks we must perform, safe operating parameters that we must maintain, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The procedures are reviewed annually and are readily accessible to our Operators. \n\n5. Training - ATOFINA has a formal training program to ensure that all employees who are operating processes are trained and tested in the operating procedures associated with these processes.   Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.  During the training, each employee must demonstrate that they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities as provided in our operating procedures. \n\n6. Contractors - Our company hires contractors to perform maintenance and construction activities at the facility.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor?s safety performance is carried out.  ATOFINA has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and our processes.  Contractors are also informed of all of the emergency response procedures should an accidental release occur.  \n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at ATOFINA.  These reviews are used to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup before ever placing equipment into operation.\n\n8.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n9. Management of Change - Written procedures are used at ATOFINA to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, and other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training on any modification.\n\n10. Incident Investigation - ATOFINA promptly investigates any incident or near miss that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release or injury.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions necessary to prevent a release or injury from reoccurring.  Investigation report findings are shared with all employees affected by the findings.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nATOFINA has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent prevention policies, there have been no releases of any RMP regulated chemicals at our facility that have had any impact on the community, the environment, or plant personnel.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nATOFINA has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

We coordinate our emergency plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC, our facility?s Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  ATOFINA Bayport has been an active member of the LEPC since purchasing the plant in 1992.  The planning effort of the LEPC helps ensure our emergency plan is coordinated with that of the local municipalities.  \n\nTo quickly and effectively respond to emergencies at our facility, ATOFINA maintains both a mobile aerial foam truck and a fast attack truck onsite.  The entire plant is surrounded by an underground firewater header that will supply firewater from our 1.2 million gallon firewater storage tank.  In addition, our firewater system is also tied into the fire water system of the neighboring plant. This serves both as a backup to our system and offers additional firewater capacity if needed.  Fixed fire monitors and deluge systems are in place throughout the facility to respond to fires.  We have emergency flares in place to safely combust flammable chemicals during upsets or emergencies.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\nThe facility has a Whalen alarm system to alert nearby persons during emergencies.  We also have procedures in place to alert the surrounding communities during emergencies. We employ trained emergency responders, including onsite industrial firefighters, who train annually at the Texas A&M University Industrial Fire Fighting School.  We also have an onsite emergency medical team and an onsite rescue team.  Our hazardous materials response team is 40-hour HAZMAT certified and can respond to incidents both on and offsite.

It is a ?joining together? of firefighting, rescue, hazardous materials, and emergency medical manpower and equipment from more than 100 industrial facilities and federal, state, and local emergency response agencies in the Houston area for mutual assistance in case of an emergency.  We conduct quarterly drills on emergency procedures at the facility (fire, medical emergency, plant evacuation, rescue) with our neighboring plants often participating.   Our responders also participate in the annual CIMA Zone 4 Drill and the annual general membership drill.\n\nContinual Improvement\nContinual improvement is an integral component of our risk management program.  We recognize that even the best system can be improved.  We are continually working to reduce our accident and release rate, primarily through employee involvement in our Facility Safety Plan.  We seek to learn as much as possible from facility drills and any unusual incidents.  Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We are in the process of installing emergency shutdown and isolation systems for the unloading of railcars containing flammable products.   In the future, we will add additional deluge systems and improve our facility foam systems.  Revalidation of our Process Hazard Analysis, Operator Requalification, and continued development of the ATOFINA Integrated Management System (AIMS) are other major steps we will take to further improve safety at our facility.
