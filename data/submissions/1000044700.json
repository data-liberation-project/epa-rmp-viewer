EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Texas City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  For example, as a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care A&reg; to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Texas City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Texas City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.\r\n\r\n1.1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant is committed to the safety of Texas City Plant workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Texas City Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Texas City Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the Texas City fire department to alert the local industrial mutual aid society (IMAS"

Texas City Plant, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at company facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Site General Manager's staff. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Safety and Environmental Manager.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the plant Safety and Environmental Manager.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the plant Safety and Environmental Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\n1.2  The ISP Texas City Plant Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in Texas City, Texas. Chemicals manufacturing commenced on this 330 acre site in 1967. ISP Texas City employs approximately 170 hourly and salaried personnel. We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: acetylene, butanediol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methylamine, 2-pyrrolidone, vinyl pyrrolidine, vinyl acetate, and propane.

Some of these feed materials and products are toxic or flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.  In total, we have three (3) process units that are covered by the RMP rule. The following are the RMP substances we handle in covered processes: acetylene, methylamine, propane, and vinyl acetate.\r\n\r\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThis information is no longer required to be submitted in the executive summary.\r\n\r\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Texas City Plant.  Because processes at the Texas City Plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard,  and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for chemical manufacturing facilities, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Texas City Plant, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of  process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, pre-startup safety reviews, design safety reviews and plant and process inspection teams.

In addition, the Texas City Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Texas City Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Texas City Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their Process Operating Manuals.  The Texas City Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique in conjunction with the Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Texas City Plant operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texas City Plant has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New or transferred employees receive basic training in Texas City Plant operations. The new or transferred employee is then given classroom training on  the unit(s) to which they will be assigned. After successfully completing this training, a new operator begins the second phase of training, on-the-job training (OJT).

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Texas City Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Texas City Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors training with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Texas City Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  The Texas City Plant also conducts social security verification and utilizes an area Safety Council to for contractor screening and training.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Texas City Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Texas City Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the auditing process, including interviews and data collection.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the Texas City Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Texas City Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n- LEL detectors with alarms in selected areas\r\n\r\n- Alcohol detectors with alarms in selected areas\r\n\r\n- Ammonia detectors with alarms in selected areas\r\n\r\n- Acetylene detectors with alarms in selected areas\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate process materials to prevent overpressure damage to equipment\r\n\r\n- Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases \r\n\r\n- Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n\r\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n- Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., dump tank)\r\n\r\n- Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n\r\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation where needed (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, redundant firewater pumps)\r\n\r\n- Release mitigation systems\r\n\r\n- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \r\n\r\n- Trained emergency response personnel\r\n\r\n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\n1.6  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years, there have been no releases at the ISP Texas City site that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelte"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, plant evacuation plans and accounting for plant personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Texas City Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Texas City Plant is coordinated with the Texas City fire department, local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and with offsite responders, Texas City IMAS, who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Texas City Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire depa"

In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, the Texas City Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \r\n\r\n1.8  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nTexas City Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The Texas City Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following capital projects are approved and in progress:\r\n\r\n- Add SIS and upgrade acetylene analyzer shutdown system in vinyl pyrrolidone reaction area\r\n- Move methylamine storage tank to more remote location\r\n- Add deluge system to methylamine storage tank and loading area\r\n- Add methylamine sensors with alarms"
