Furthermore, the Alexander Orr WTP has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP and PSMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe key element of complying with the RMP and PSMP rules is development of policies, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and emergency response plans to ensure the safety of employees and the public.  MDWASD is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to its employees and protecting the public, on-site and off-site property, and the environment from releases of chlorine.

The facility's mission is to protect public health by providing safe drinking water.  The Alexander Orr WTP is located at 6800 SW 87 Avenue, Miami, Florida.  The plant is bounded by SW 64th Street to the north, SW 87 Avenue to the east, and by SW 72nd Street (Sunset Drive) to the south.  The Alexander Orr WTP covers 68 acres.  \r\n\r\nThe Alexander Orr WTP stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule. The chlorine system at the Alexander Orr WTP provides chlorine to the softened water to maintain required disinfection levels for drinking water.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Alexander Orr WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered in rail cars to a chlorine car enclosure.  The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure which is fed to two chlorine facilities designated as Chemical Plant 1 and Chemical Plant 2.  Liquid chlorine flows from the rail cars through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in Chlorine Rooms 1 and 2.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms to ensure that normal temperature is maintained.  Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas meter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces hypochlorous acid that flows through polyvinyl chloride piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\r\n\r\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine systems are provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\r\nAt the beginning of the 1900s water-borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.).  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S.  dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\r\n\r\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule in volume 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The goal of these regulations is to reduce the risk to employees, the public, and the environment by preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Alexander Orr Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is regulated because it stores chlorine above the threshold quantity defined in these regulations.\r\n\r\nThe RMP Program Level 3 regulations are similar to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) rule in volume 29 CFR part 1910.119."
