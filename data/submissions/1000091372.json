(MarkWest) Hopedale Fractionator facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe Hopedale Fractionator is located in Jewett, Ohio. Its primary function encompasses the fractionation of natural gas liquids (NGLs). The NGL stream is separated into purity products of Propane, Iso-Butane, N-Butane, and Natural Gasoline, which consists of Iso-Pentane, N-Pentane, and 2,2-Dimethylpropane amongst additional non-flammable components. Ethyl Mercaptan is also stored at the site and is used as an odorant in some propane shipments.\r\n\r\nThe NGLs are received through NGL pipelines to the facility. They are separated using extraction towers with specific heats and pressures to isolate each purity product. Once separated the products are stored in storage tanks at the site awaiting shipment via pipeline, truck or rail.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels and the total of each substance over the threshold for RMP substances has been calculated in a separate document that is available for review but is not included in this summary as it may contain confidential business information. \r\n\r\nAs stated above the products at the Hopedale Fractionator contain propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. Methane and ethane are removed from the NGL stream prior to it reaching this plant. The regulated flammable substanc"

This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MPLX facility were based on set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario, and 40 CFR 68.28 for the alternative release scenario analysis. The worst case and alternative case radii to endpoint were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA. In evaluating the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios there were no administrative controls or mitigation measures taken into account to reduce potential off-site impact. Populations within each radius were determined using the Missouri Census Data Center.\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Program Level 3 accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nMarkWest Ohio Fractionation Company, L.L.C., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n\r\nMarkWest Ohio Fractionation Company, L.L.C., has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nEach PHA will address the following: \r\n1) hazards of the process, \r\n2) previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences, \r\n3) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, \r\n4) engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships, \r\n5) facility siting issues, and \r\n6) human factors. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
