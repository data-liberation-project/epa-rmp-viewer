Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6 Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (Cas #7664-41-7) is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nThe total ammonia inventory exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention..  \r\n\r\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\r\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\r\nDiscussion removed per regulation\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Result Summary\r\nDiscussion removed per regulation\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\r\n\r\nIIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\r\nIIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\nIIAR Bulletin R1, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Gateway Plant #75101 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 standard since October 15, 2012.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents in the last 5-years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Americold Plant #75101 (Gateway) has an Emergency Action Program in place.

Early in 2012 it was decided to start up a portion of the refrigeration system.  This small portion of the system was renovated prior to introducing ammonia.  Because of this we are considering this the initial start-up of this system. \r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Gateway Plant #75101 abides by the emergency action plan procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency action plan Plan program.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.)\tTo save lives.\r\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\r\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nAmericold maintains an safety & PSM teams whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Gateway Plant #75101 chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For exam"
