PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nFort St. Vrain Station is a gas-fired electric generating station.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling and process water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 6 containers (12,000 lbs.) on site.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one-ton container of chlorine) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  T"

A distance of 3.0 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated for a release of 2000 pounds in ten minutes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of a release of 960 pounds of chlorine over a one-hour period due to a severed 5/16 inch pigtail on the one-ton container.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.7 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Fort St. Vrain Station Chlorine System PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n7 Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant PSM/RMP program, as well as ready access to program information\n7 Process safety information has been collected and summarized in the PSM/RMP manual\n7 Process hazard analyses (PHAs) - The initial PHAs for the chlorine system were conducted in 1997 and 1998.  All recommendations from the PHAs have been addressed.\n7 Operating procedures for the chlorine process, which are included in the Fort St. Vrain Station Chlorine PSM/RMP Manual\n7 Training for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system\n7 Contractor management policy, which is to not allow contractors to operate or maintain the chlorine system\n7 Pre-startup safety review procedure for implementation for significant system changes to ensure that the construction and equipment installation is according to design specifications, appropriate procedures are in place and accurate, a PHA has been done and the recommendations resolved, and employees are trained prior to startup of the modified system\n7 Mechanical integrity program through the facility SSR system to ensure that the chlorine system equipm"

The program is described in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.

Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Fort St. Vrain Station PSM/RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations were implemented, all were considered.  The exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
