We prevent accidents by designing for safety, taking care of our equipment, operating safely, and auditing our operations.   SFFI has an active Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which is audited annually.\n\nSFFI has proven to be safe facility. This is demonstrated by the fact that no ammonia release with definite impact has ever occurred.  A worst case scenario modeling was performed for a large scale ammonia release.  In addition a more typical alternate accident scenario was modeled.  An emergency response plan for the facility and the local community was coordinated with Umatilla County Emergency Management."
