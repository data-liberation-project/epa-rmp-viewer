      "SummaryText": "1. Facility Policy. The owners, management and employees of the City of Savannah Water Treatment Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Andrew County LEPC, and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of drinking water to the community.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program. The City of Savannah abides by all pertinent State of Missouri Regulations related to Chlorine and to guard against accidental releases of chlorine at the water treatment plant. If a release should occur, we will notify applicable response agencies to minimize the harm to the surrounding community and the environment.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History. There have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program. The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan. We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release. If a large release of chlorine takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to improve Saftey. We currently have plans to relocate our 1,000 gallon propane tank to a new location that will provide protection from vehicle traffic."
