Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Woodspur Farms has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Woodspur Farms, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Woodspur Farms has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nSystem 1                      Anhydrous Ammonia                13,000\n\nSystem 2                      Anhydrous Ammonia                13,000\n\nSystem 3                      Anhydrous Ammonia                 3,400\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. \n\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedure"

Each emergency control box contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\nAll three (3) ammonia refrigeration systems at Woodspur Farms consist of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping within their respective systems.

In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.

Nevertheless, Woodspur Farms continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Woodspur Farms's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Woodspur Farms's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nWoodspur Farms has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Woodspur Farms has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Woodspur Farms now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Woodspur Farms employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
