All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nWoodspur Farms has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Woodspur Farms continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Woodspur Farms's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Woodspur Farms's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nWoodspur Farms has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Woodspur Farms has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Woodspur Farms now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Woodspur Farms employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Woodspur Farms will continue to maintain ove"
