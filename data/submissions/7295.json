      "SummaryText": "The City of Highland Park's George B. Prindle Water Treatment Plant has  been in continuous operation\nsince its commissioning in 1929.  During this time NO (on or off premise)  CHLORINE RELATED \nINJURIES HAVE OCCURRED.  This enviable safety record is typical of the water treatment industry because safety precautions have always been an important part of water treatment facility design.  Our \nchlorine feed system features delivery of chlorine to the point of application in a line under partial vacuum.  \nShould this line sustain damage, it will leak air into the line instead of chlorine out to the atmosphere.\n\nOut of concern for the recreational boating and swimming facilities abutting our Plant, we incorporated a \nchlorine leak scrubber system into a facility upgrade in 1986, long before the attention of the public and \nregulators turned to this issue.  This system features a leak detection system which can contain and \nneutralize the contents of a full ton chlorine cylinder without human intervention.  Integral to this system is \nautomatic notification of our Fire Department.  \n\nWe have also built our own leak simulator from the head of an old chlorine cylinder.  This device is used \nfor in-house and in cooperative drills with the Fire Department to simulate various types of tank and valve \nfailures.  This enables us to maintain a high level of readiness as well as familiarity with the emergency \nprocedures and equipment.\n\nOur concern for the public safety had led us to explore alternatives to the use of gaseous chlorine.  A \ncomponent of our next Plant renovation effort is the evaluation of sodium hypochlorite as a replacement."
