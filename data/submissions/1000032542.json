      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis document represents the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the peaking facility owned by the Gilroy Energy Center, LLC and operated under the name of Feather River Energy Center (FREC) located in Yuba City, California. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n?    Acknowledge the operation of a source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n?    identify hazards\n?    design and maintain a safe facility\n?    prevent releases\n?    minimize consequences of releases.\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. FREC has prepared and implemented its RMP of the aqueous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\nThe RMP applies to the FREC facility located at:\n302 Burns Drive, Yuba City, CA. 95993\n\nThe FREC consists of one 49.4-MW General Electric (GE) LM6000 Sprint simple-cycle combustion turbine generator and associated equipment. Principal equipment includes the combustion turbine generator (CTG), exhaust ducting and stack, and the cooling tower. \nEmission controls incorporate Best Available Control Technology (BACT).

      "SummaryText": "e includes selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and oxidation catalyst air pollution control systems. Aqueous ammonia of a concentration of less than 20 percent by weight is used as the SCR reagent. A 12,000-gallon aqueous ammonia storage tank is used for the SCR system. On-site trailer or skid-mounted water treatment units provide de-mineralized water on demand for turbine injection and cooling. Raw and de-mineralized water storage tanks are installed on-site. Additional project components include an electrical building, fuel gas compressor metering island, emergency generator, continuous emission monitoring system, and fire suppression system. Operations of the plant will be controlled remotely, from the Greenleaf 2/Yuba City Energy Center Control Building.\nWater injection suppression controls nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions to 25 parts-per-million by volume on a dry basis (ppmvd), corrected to 15 percent oxygen. NOX emissions are further controlled to less than 5 ppmvd corrected to 15 percent oxygen with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system; volatile organic compound (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are controlled by the addition of an oxidation catalyst. Particulate emissions are controlled by combustion air filtration and the use of natural gas, which is low in particulate matter. \nSubstance Used/Stored: Aqueous Ammonia <20% Solution (CAS# 1336-21-6)\nFacility SIC: 4911    NAICS Code: 221112\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0 respectively. A brief description of the prevention and emergency response policies is as follows.\n\nAccident Prevention Program Policies and Elements\n\nThe accident prevention program is implemented through an established set of policies and programs including, but not limited to, the following:\n?    Inspection and maintenance program for all system equipment.\n?    Monitoring of employee and contractor use of the system.\n?    Contractor Safety Program\n"

Establishment of criteria defining an emergency.\n?    Staff training and responsibility assignments.\n?    Emergency notification procedures (on and off-site)\n?    Evacuation procedures\n?    Emergency response procedures.\n?

System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n?    Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n?    Proper operation of all system equipment.\n?    Proper operation of all system equipment.\n?

FREC personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, FREC personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. YCFD HazMat Unit will handle spill/release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, FREC will join forces with YCFD HazMat Unit and a State/County OES personnel in a ?unified command effort? until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\nThe facility will constantly strive for improved performance and reliability from all its processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified, they will be evaluated by staff for application and implementation."
