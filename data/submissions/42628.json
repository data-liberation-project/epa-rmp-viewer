It is Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc.?s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc.?s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc. and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with Process Safety Management (PSM) and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc. audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 303A Salinas Road in Pajaro, California.  There are two refrigeration systems currently at the facility, the original (or main) refrigeration system and a second system based in engine room #2.  The original refrigeration system was installed in 1946.  The second refrigeration system (based in engine room #2) was installed in 1970.  Both refrigeration systems have been upgraded and modernized several times over the years.\n\nIn both of the refrigeration systems at Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc., anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cool"

Although the systems normally operate independently, it is possible to shut down engine room #2 and operate the cold storage rooms serviced by engine room #2 from the main refrigeration system.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, portions of the refrigeration system can be ?pumped down? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver in the original (main) refrigeration system is 4,930 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n? An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n? Written operating procedures are being developed and will be implemented, and will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n? Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are being developed and will be implemented.\n\n? Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n? Written mechanical integrity procedures are being established and will be im"

Pre-startup safety reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n? Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n? Incident investigation procedures are being developed.\n\n? A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation is being developed and will be implemented.\n\n? Hot work permits will be issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system, when required.\n\n? A Contractor Safety Policy is being developed and will be implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented at Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc., the owner has accepted the overall responsibility for the RMP.  The owner has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.
