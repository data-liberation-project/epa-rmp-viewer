The Bureau Office formulates operating policy and procedures, provides technical advice to the Commission and staff, and participates in inter and intra-agency meetings.    The Bureau Director serves as Chairman of the Blue Plains Regional Committee, and the Principal Civil Engineer serves as Chairman of the Blue Plains Technical Committee.

Support is also given to organizations outside the Commission, such as the US Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Maryland Environmental Services, and the Maryland Department of the Environment.\n\n\tThe Division operates six wastewater treatment plants, with an average daily flow of 73 mgd.  In addition to the seven plants there are thirty-nine (39) wastewater-pumping stations operated by the Division.  Five (5) of the wastewater treatment plants are covered by the CAAA 112 (r) requirements; two of the plants do not use the EPA threshold chemicals. \n\nPISCATAWAY WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe Piscataway Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located at 11 Farmington Road West in Accokeek, Maryland. It is our mission to protect and enhance the environmental quality of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, while meeting the wastewater needs of approximately 150,000 people in the southwest quadrant of Prince George\u0012s County. The Piscataway WWTP is designed to treat 30 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater. It employs a Step Feed Biological Nitrogen Removal process, followed by chemical phosphorous removal, secondary clarification, gravity filtration, chlorination, chemical pH adjustment, and dechlorination prior to release into the Potomac River. The current plant average flow is approximately 20 mgd. Plant biosolids are dewatered and nutrients are returned to the soil for beneficial reuse through application on agricultural land.

The plant has also received many awards from the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, including Gold Awards, for excellent compliance with the plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit in 1986, 1997, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1998. Piscataway WWTP has also received the Prince George\u0012s County Beautification Award in 1988, 1991, and 1992. In 1998, the plant was the proud recipient of the Governor's Award of Excellence.\n\nVII.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Commission accidental release prevention program is part of the agency\u0012s overall Safety & Health Program and involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to ensure our workers and the public a safe environment.  The RMP requirement is essentially an expansion of the OSHA Process Safety requirement and the Employee and Community Right to Know programs that have been in existence for a number of years.   \n\n\tHazardous material has always been recognized as a unique hazard for our employees and the public; therefore, we have made every possible effort to ensure the proper and safe use of all hazardous materials.  WSSC\u0012s chemical safety prevention program includes: the availability of personal protective equipment; obtaining and use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS); designing facilities for safety and accident prevention; training and educating employees on chemical systems and processes;  planning and practicing for emergency situations; requiring consultants and contractors to abide by established safety practices; sharing of information with"

Piscataway has an excellent safety record, as evidenced by winning the WSSC Wastewater Operations Division Annual Safety Award, which was awarded to the WSSC wastewater treatment plant with the best safety record four years in a row from 1989 through 1992, and also in 1996 and 1998. Because safety is so important, there have been no releases of sulfur dioxide or chlorine gas to the environment in the history of the plant.\n\nThe plant is designed to provide reliable operations year round. Power to the plant originates from two different electrical sources, providing electrical redundancy and thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage.  The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process. Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and provide maximum protection to our environment.\n\nIX.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PLANNING\n\nThe Piscataway WFP has an written emergency response and planning program.  A written emergency plan is maintained by on site plant personnel with the support of the WSSC Safety Section.  The plan is consistent with the EPA 40 CFR, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 of the Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and includes: delegation of authority; notification of officials; emergency procedures; and procedures for working with local officials should an emergency create the need for an evacuation of the plant and/or surrounding community. \n\n   Plant personnel are regularly trained on the plan requirements and conduct periodic emergency response drills for a variety of plant emergencies.
