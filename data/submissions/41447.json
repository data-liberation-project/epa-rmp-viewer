The facility has implemented a process safety management plan in accordance with OSHA standards. Additionally, the company has developed an Emergency Response Plan in association with the vulnerability assessment performed under the bio-terrorism act of 2002. There have been no incidents involving the chlorine containers or use. The facility is visited on a daily basis by a trained employee familiar with the chlorination process. The facility is located in a remote rural area with very little potential to impact residential areas. There is no commercial property near the facility."
