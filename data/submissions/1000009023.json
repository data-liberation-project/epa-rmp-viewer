In the past five years there have been no ammonia releases that would be classified as an accitental release per the RMP regulations.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nHAZMAT training is performed in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and pre-emergency planning and drills are conducted with local emergency responders. The emergency response program complies with the OSHA PSM Program as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119. The HAZMAT team conducts joint training and drills with the local fire department. Facility personnel conduct meetings informing the public of the facility's Emergency Response Program. The facility uses the Incident Command System that was developed by the National Fire Academy. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nCF will continue to provide support to and work with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and emergency responders to plan for the appropriate emergency response and to prepare for responding to an emergency through practice and drills. In addition, as part of the company's community giving program, CF Industries provided funds used to send members of the Tampa Fire Department to special ammonia suppression training in Holden, Louisiana, conducted by CF Industries and the Louisiana State Police. This training provides fire fighters the opportunity to learn how to protect the public in the unlikely event of an accidental ammonia release. "
