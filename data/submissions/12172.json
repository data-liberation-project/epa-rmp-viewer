      "SummaryText": "     The Fayetteville Water Treatment Facility uses chlorine to treat water at a rate of 5.0 MGD.  The facility hasone (1) active 1-ton chlorine cylinder, one (1)  cylinder for switch over, and one (1) reserve cylinder located in the same building on-site.  The building is made of concrete blocks with steel doors and roofing and would be considered a passive mitigation control.  There are no administrative controls limiting the fill level of the chlorine cylinders.\n     The worse case release scenario is the failure of one cylinder containg 2,000 lbs of chlorine, 10 minute release within a building, and rural topography.  This scenarios results in a 2.2 mile radius to the toxic endpoint under worse-case weather conditions.  The alternative release scenario is a result of a transfer hose failure that would release the cylinder contents over a 30 minute period, within a building, and with rural topography.  This release event would have an affected radius of 0.3 miles from the facility.  \n     The facility prevention program is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and an Emergency Action Plan in place.   In case of an emergency, the facility has chosen to call the Linclon County Emergency Management Agency (LCERA) for response.  All accidential releases will be handled by the LCERA and emergency respnse procedures for facility employees and applicable contact names and numbers are included in the emergency action plan.  \n     The facility has not had a reportable accident within the last five years.\n     The facility intendes on improving safety at the site by adhering to the RMP regulations and maintaining maintenance on the chlorine system and proper training for employees."
