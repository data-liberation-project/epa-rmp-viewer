Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe, at the Andover Manufacturing Center of The Gillette Company (Gillette, AMC) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our plant.  We are completely coordinated with the Town of Andover Fire department, which provides emergency response expertise in the event of an accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur plant's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of personal care and toiletry products (e.g. aerosol deodorants, aerosol and non-aerosol hair care products, aerosol antiperspirants, aerosol body sprays, aerosol shave creams and shave gels).  We have five regulated substances present at our facility in six different processes.  These substances include isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], isopentane [butane, 2-methyl-], propane, dimethyl ether [methane, oxybis-] and difluoroethane [ethane, 1,1-difluoro-].  All of the regulated substances at our facility are used in the production of aerosol personal care and toiletry products.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of our six different processes at any one time are as follows:  Dimethyl ether [methane, oxybis-] is present in a maximum quantity of approximately 140,000lbs; isopentane [butane, 2-methyl-] blended with isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] has a maximum quantity of approximately 140,000lbs; isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] blended with propane has a maximum quantity of approximately 100,000lbs; isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] has a maximum quantity of approximately 120,000lbs; difluoroethane [ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] has a maximum quantity of a"

The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp tool.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have also utilized EPA's RMP*Comp tool.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our Tank Farm in the A-70 storage process.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 130,000lbs of isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] and propane blend.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using this worst case release scenario, under normal weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure and would have minimal / insignificant damage to residential units.  This is the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch specified for this regulated substance under the RMP Rule.  It should be noted that the A-70 vapor cloud explosion release scenario is a representative 'worst case' of all six Program 3 processes at our facility.  \n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the Tank Farm in the dimethyl ether [methane, oxybis-] storage process.  The release is assumed to result in a Boiling Liquid Expansive Vapor Explosion (BLEVE).  The scenario involves the release of approximately 140,000lbs. of gas as a BLEVE.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge s"

It should be noted that the DME BLEVE release scenario is a representative 'worst case' of all six Program 3 processes at our facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur plant has systems in place to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This plant was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our plant are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nGillette, AMC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur plant conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and adequately controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety, environment and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\nWe employ an overall risk assessment (ORA) prior to the installation of any equipment or process.  Like the PHA, the ORA is conducted by a team of various qualified personnel with expertise in areas such as engineering, process operations, facilities,"

This is conducted in the early design phase of a project in order to address, and potentially design out, identified risks.\n\n\n\nAny non-routine activities that take place in our plant are preceded by a Quick Risk Prediction (QRP).  Personnel involved in the task and those working in the area review all possible risks associated with the activity and either eliminate the risk, minimize the risk, or make everyone aware of the presence of the risk.  QRPs also include any contractors that may be involved.  \n\n\n\nEach shift team meeting begins with a Safety Trigger, which is a safety assessment of the planned work conditions and activities for that shift.  Each safety trigger assessment is either rated green (low hazard), yellow (moderate hazard) or red (high hazard).  A yellow or red assessment will trigger the operating shift team to perform a Quick Risk Prediction or determine other mitigating actions to minimize the risk during that shift.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Gillette, AMC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nGillette, AMC has comprehensive training programs in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Gas Room Operators (GROs) receive a thorough initial training program prior to operating a gas room and refresher training is provided at least every six months.  \n\n\n\nDepartments utilize training 'step up cards' to document the skills necessary to perform their job with excellence.  There is a separate Health, Safety and Environmental step up car"
