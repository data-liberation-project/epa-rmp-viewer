The Release Prevention Program includes:\n\n\n\nSafety Information (SI)\n\nLES develops and keeps current working copies of SI documentation including information pertaining to hazards of the process, the technology of the process and the equipment of the process. This information is used to inform both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nHazard Review (HR)\n\nLES is committed to performing HRs to identify, evaluate and control hazards associated with Operating Procedures (OPs). Rokeby Station has developed OPs as required and keeps them current.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nLES is committed to providing employees with comprehensive training to assure that the workforce can perform their duties safely, efficiently and effectively.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nLES has developed a maintenance program for the ammonia system at Rokeby Generating Station. The maintenance program includes pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency\n\nshutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance procedures are developed or promulgated by equipment vendors, federal or state regulations, or industry codes.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe LES Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan for Rokeby Generating Station has well defined incident reporting and investigation procedures. Responsibilities, titles and phone numbers are provided therein.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 668.155(e) The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Rokeby Station has not had a reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years. \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(f) The Emergency Response Program\n\nLES has a detailed Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan designated specifically for\n\nan ammonia release for Rokeby Generating Station. The plan is reviewed with response\n\norganizations on a routine basis.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(g) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLES will follow up on all of the recommendations of the Risk Management Program in a timely manner. \n\n",

To augment power output during high summer air temperatures, a cooling system is used to lower turbine inlet air temperatures. The cooling system uses ammonia refrigeration to make ice that is stored in two separate concrete tanks with capacities of 1.1 million gallons and 3 million gallons respectively. The cooling system consists of Ice System #1, which was commercial in 1991, and Ice System #2 which was comme"
