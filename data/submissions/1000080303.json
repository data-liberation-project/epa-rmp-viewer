LES is committed to the accidental\n\nrelease prevention program and also maintains a detailed Emergency Response Plan designated\n\nspecifically for the Terry Bundy Generating Station. The plan is routinely reviewed with HazMat\n\nresponder organizations.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Rokeby Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base load electric power generation by utilizing one or more of the three dual fuel combustion turbines, two diesel blackstart engines, and one fuel oil storage tank located on the 160-acre onsite. To augment power output during high summer air temperatures, a cooling system is used to lower turbine inlet air temperatures. The cooling system uses ammonia refrigeration to make ice that is stored in two separate concrete tanks with capacities of 1.1 million gallons and 3 million gallons respectively. The cooling system consists of Ice System #1, which was commercial in 1991, and Ice System #2 which was comme"
