This facility is one of five water and wastewater plants operated by the City. WTP #2 and three other plants have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold. The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant. Only WTP #2 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\r\n\r\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\nCOAB WTP #2 Accidental Release Prevention Program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices. The prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\n2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM \r\nCOAB has a management system in place which is led by the Deputy Public Works Director, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements. This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\r\n\r\n3.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2 \r\nCOAB maintains policies, procedures, and systems as part of their prevention program. These are applied to WTP #2 and each COAB treatment plant. The COAB program addresses each of the elements needed to implement the EPA RMP Program Level 2, which are also addressed in the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Being a public entity, COAB is subject to only the EPA RMP Level 2 Prevention Program. The policies and procedures are maintained in the COAB Document Management System (DMS).\r\n\r\n4.\tSITE DESCRIPTION \r\nThe site is owned and operated by the City of Atlantic Beach. The site is located at 2301 Mayport Road, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida. The site is bordered by a mini-storage warehouse on the north"

The facility includes a chlorine storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems. These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&IDs) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\r\nCOAB WTP# 1 employs two full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations. Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\r\n\r\n5.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE \r\nChlorine is the only regulated substance onsite which exceeds the 40 CFR 68 threshold quantity. The COAB chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption. It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to the process control systems.  Chlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical. It is an irritant and it is corrosive. Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2. It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable. It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards. Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\r\n\r\n6.\tWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \r\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.\r\nThe first is a \"worst case release\". The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the ... shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  An atmospheric disp"

The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\r\n\r\na.\tWORST CASE \r\nAn atmospheric dispersion assessment for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions. Results demonstrate a distance of ____ miles to the toxic endpoint. The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at ______ people.\r\n\r\nb.\tALTERNATIVE CASE \r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the vacuum system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container. Assessment using the EPA water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 20.0 lb/min. The toxic endpoint distances determined is ___ miles. The residential population potentially that would be impacted by this release is _____.\r\n\r\n7.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\nThe COAB Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the OSHA PSM Standard.
