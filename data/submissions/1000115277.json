The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and storm water management.\n\n2. Emergency Action Plan: Skylark Meats, LLC has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms, and alerting. The Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the hazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC.\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: Skylark Meats, LLC is a meat processing, cold storage, and distribution facility located at 4430 South 110th Street, Omaha, NE. The processed products and cold storage of those products require refrigeration. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used.\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp(TM) was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years; however, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Monthly Safety meetings and training is conducted for all employees at this facility; in addition, PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements. Refer to the Process Safety Management Program f"
