(Addressed under Training Element)\n\n6) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Hazard Review study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  In addition, some of these elements are reviewed and trained on annually or every three years or if a change is made at minimum as required by the code and industry standards. This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities. \n\nSecond, all Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers, LLC, employees and at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the complete CalARP, the IIPP and more for review, comment and input.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees.\n\n7) Compliance Audits: Verification of Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers, LLC, 's compliance with the CalARP program.  The audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program has been implemented and properly documented by Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers, LLC, personnel.  Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers, LLC,  has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find.  A priority list is developed, and target dates are set for any changes or corrections.   (Addressed under Compliance Audit Element)   \n\n8) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nA. Calibrate and test all safeties annually\nB. Install remote notification system for alarms and failures.\nC.
