      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Loveland, Colorado (City) takes a very active approach in  maintaining and improving chemical safety.  The City has demonstrated its  commitment to safety by upgrading the chemical feed process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in early 1999 from a gas pressure system to a vacuum system mounted directly on a chlorine cylinder, which decreases system maintenance dramatically and therefore reduces the potential for chlorine leaks.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\n\nThe City's WTP is located northwest of the City at 3152 North County Road 29. Chlorine is used at the facility to provide disinfection of the public water supply.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders, and no more than eight cylinders of chlorine (16,000 pounds) are stored at the WTP.\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single cylinder of chlorine outside of any enclosure. The rule for worst case release analysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes. The alternative case release scenario was based on process hazard analysis, and involves the release of 600 pounds of chlorine in 60 minutes as a result of a fusible plug failure. The distance to endpoint for both scenarios was analyzed using EPA's RMP*Comp(TM). The analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles and an alternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for  Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on the written operating procedures for the WTP, as well as an aggressive\n\nmaintenance, inspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered process.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize un"

      "SummaryText": "intended releases of chlorine.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe WTP has NOT had an accidental release of chlorine within the last five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the primary responder to the WTP is the City of Loveland Fire Department.  WTP employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBy the winter of year 2016 the City's WTP expects to eliminate the storage of the eight 1 ton chlorine cylinders (16,000 pounds) from the site. The plan is to have two 7,000 gallon tanks that will store 12.5% sodium hypochlorite for disinfection. "
