      "SummaryText": "The Borger Products Terminal serves as the beginning pump station for five (5) different pipelines transporting refined products from the Borger Refinery.\r\n\r\nEach piping system is fed from refinery tanks and consists of at least one (1) coalescer and two (2) dehydrators, a meter, and continues on to mainline pumps. The coalescers and the dehydrators are RMP covered and DOT jurisdiction starts at the meter. \r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the equipment in each of the five (5) pipeline systems (with the jurisdiction ending at the meters), and the Dehydration Regeneration system. This document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68). The process is classified as Program Level 1 under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the Facility is to act as a refined petroleum storage and distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling Butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Phillips 66 - Borger Products Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which LPG is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent or minimize possible releases of Butane, if a release does occur, an emergency response plan is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the local fire departme"

The maximum amount of Butane that can be stored at this facility is approximately 235,000 pounds and the maximum amount of Propane is approximately 88,500 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThe Facility complies with 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA and with all applicable State codes and regulations. The Facility's covered process complies with 29 CFR Part 1910.119 (Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals). Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents/incidents related to or the operation of the covered system that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place during the past five years.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nResponse actions are coordinated with the local fire department and Hutchinson County Emergency Management. The Facility has a written Emergency Response Program in the event of an accidental release which includes emergency health care and steps to inform the public.  A plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, medical emergency, etc., and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nThe Facility is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems through the use of prevention programs such as MOC and the PHA program. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur.
