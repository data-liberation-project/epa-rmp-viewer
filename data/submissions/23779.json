The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Resolution Performance Products:\n\n Methyl mercaptan - an RMP toxic chemical worst-case and alternate release scenario\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" involving a toxic substance at this facility would involve the catastrophic failure of the methyl mercaptan storage tank. This scenario assumes a maximum inventory of methyl mercaptan would be released and evaporates within a 10-minute period. Under the EPA defined worst weather conditions, the methyl mercaptan gas cloud could potentially travel 6.7 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 25ppm. No credit is taken for passive or active mitigation in the analysis. Potential public receptors include schools, residences, recreation areas, and industrial areas. Environmental receptors within this distance include a state park.\n\nAn \"alternate release scenario\" for methyl mercaptan involves a 1\" inch hole in the piping of the methyl mercaptan tank. It is estimated that a normal inventory of methyl mercaptan would be released over a 13-minute period. Active mitigation accounted for in the analysis includes operator intervention to shut-off the pump and isolate the leak. No credit is taken for passive mitigation. Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, the normal inventory of methyl mercaptan could potentially travel 0.8 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 25 ppm. Potential public receptors include schools, residences, and industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nEpichlorohydrin - Alternate release scenario at tank D-340:\n\nAn \"alternate release scenario\" for epichlorohydrin (ECH) involves a failure of a 3-inch storage tank discharge line inside the tank dike.  This line failure results in an epichlorohydrin spill into the tank dike. Credit i"

Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, this release would travel 0.19 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 20ppm. There are no public or environmental receptors within the area potentially affected by the spill. The EPA OCA Guidance document was used in evaluating this scenario.\n \n\nC-Plant-  Alternate release scenario Overfilling T-3407.  Tank 3407 is inside a tank farm, which is 10000 square feet in diameter and has 4 1/2 ft high wall around the tanks. The epichlorohydrin(ECH) is coming out of 4 inch hatch on top of the tank. Under the EPA altenate release weather conditions, this release would travel .20 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 20ppm.

This flammable substance release scenario assumes the entire contents of the tank is released and vaporizes to form a vapor cloud that subsequently ignites.  In this scenario, a pressure of 1-psi over normal atmospheric pressure is used as the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion. Although, we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit is taken for active or passive mitigation. Under the EPA defined worst weather conditions, the pentane explosion could potentially affect areas up to 1.8 miles away before the pressure diminished below the 1-psi endpoint. Potential public receptors include schools, residences, and industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.

The facility is located on Highway 225 in Deer Park, Texas. Resolution sells resins & its precursors to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products ranging from plastics to building materials. About 150 full-time employees work at the site.\n\n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nResolution is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for our workers, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations.As part of this commitment, Resolution has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the site. The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Resolution Deer Park Chemical Site.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at Resolution Site consists of the following three elements:\n\n\u00b7 A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and to (b) provide information to the public regarding accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substan"

In fact,\nResolution has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nResolution's  policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance needs to be used, plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes. \n\nResolution  strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment. Resolution also uses Corporate Engineering Guides and Standards (EGS) when designing new or modifying ex"

The facility mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\n\nResolutions goal is to minimize impacts from accidental release should they occur. In the event of an accidental release, plant operators and emergency responders work together closely to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment. The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled at Resolution. The facility promotes the use of the CAER Phone Hotline number to inform citizens of any unusual plant event and will actively work with the Deer Park Citizen's Advisory Council. \n\nResolution's Emergency Response Plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations, as well as corporate guidelines.  This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency within the boundaries of the facility.  If the emergency extends beyond or could potentially extend beyond the plant boundaries, the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is notified and a statement of the type of emergency and any community protection factors are recommended.\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, Resolution has established a management system lead by the Plant Manager with support from the Health,Safety (H&S) & Environmental Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n2.Resolution Deer Park Site and Regulated Substanc"

The facility is located on Highway 225 in Deer Park,Texas. Resolution manufacturers and sells resins and it's precursors to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products. \n\nThe following RMP listed toxic and flammable chemicals are handled at Resolution:\n\n    \u00b7 Regulated Toxic Substances: Methyl mercaptan, Epichlorohydrin.\n    \u00b7 Regulated Flammable Substances:Pentane.\n\n The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (' 68.155(c))\n\n\nThe facility performed off-site consequence analyses of accidental releases of regulated substances to estimate potential affects to the public or the environment. The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternate release scenario. Resolution does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in place to prevent such a scenario. The alternative release scenarios that have been developed are based on more likely potential accidental releases. These will be shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to assist them in improving the community emergency response plan.\n\nResolution will continue to address RMP with the local emergency planning committees.\n\nDistances to toxic and flammable endpoints were calculated based on the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA standard for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview.

Under the EPA Guidance document a pool fire, the estimated distance to heat radiation would be .19 miles to the endpoint.  Potential public receptors include industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point. The EPA OCA Guidance document was used in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(d))\n\nUnder the EPA RMP criteria for establishing a prevention program, a Program 3 prevention program is required for all Resolution's covered processes.  A Program 3 prevention program is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment beyond the plant's boundaries.  The following sections briefly describe the 12 elements of Resolution Plant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Resolution maintains technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  The facility ensures that this process safety information is up-to-date and available to all employees.  Information pertaining to hazardous chemicals in the process is documented in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n\u00b7 Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits \n\u00b7 Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point) \n\u00b7 Reactivity and corrosivity data \n\u00b7 Thermal and chemical stability data \n\u00b7 Hazards of mixing substances in the process\n\nInformation pertaining to the technology and equipment in the process is documented in design"
