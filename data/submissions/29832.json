      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nROCKY MOUNTAIN ENERGY CENTER\n\n\n\nThe facility and the regulated substance handled:  \n\nRocky Mountain Energy Center (RMEC) is a 600 MW combined-cycle electric generation facility located in a rural area of Weld County Colorado, near the towns of Hudson and Keenesburg.  It is a zero-liquid-discharge facility and employs state of the art equipment and processes to control air emissions.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the selective catalytic reduction process to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX.)  Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic chemical and an uncontrolled release could be hazardous to employees and to the public.  The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a liquid under pressure in two 52,500-pound (12,000-gallon) usable capacity storage tanks.\n\nFacility?s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia necessitates a facility Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as a Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Because both programs focus on the health and safety concerns of storing and processing anhydrous ammonia, Rocky Mountain Energy Center has developed these two programs together.   Program development was done by the facility PSM Committee.  This team consists of plant employees and management with experience in RMP and PSM development and risk analysis techniques as well as expertise in process operations and maintenance.   The committee called in outside experts at several points during program development.  These experts included Calpine and contractor Engineers and Safety Representatives, the system vendor Product Engineer, the Weld County Fire Marshall?s Office, and Calpine Commissioning Engineers.  The committee reported progress in program development to other employees and to management at weekly facility Safety Meetings.\n\nCalpine Corporation has made a major commitment to worker safety and environmental compliance at its facilities nationwide"

      "SummaryText": ".  A corporate safety specialist has trained all employees at the plant in the Calpine Safety Culture.  Comprehensive corporate guidelines govern the development of all facility safety, health, and environmental procedures.  Facility employees conduct weekly Safety Meetings and participate in standing Safety, Environmental, and PSM Committees.\n\nWorst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nRMEC chose the model used in the EPA?s RMP Comp software as the worst case for RMP analysis.  Other models considered included those in Science Applications International Corporation?s ?Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration? and the EPA?s ?Technical Background Document for Offsite Consequence Analysis for Anhydrous Aqueous Ammonia, Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide.?  All of these analyses yield similar results and are based on very conservative models and assumptions.  One conservative assumption is that the entire contents of a tank becomes airborne and forms a cloud of vapor and mist.  No consideration was made for the passive mitigation (secondary containment) or active mitigation (deluge system) actually in place.  \n\nThe likelihood of the entire contents of the tank becoming airborne without any mitigation is extremely low.  Several steps have been taken to prevent the major storage system failure assumed in the worst-case analysis.  The storage and handling system has been built in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1 (1999,) ?American National Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.?  Several inspections, tests, and documentation reviews have been conducted by The Industrial Company (TIC,) Calpine Project Engineering, Calpine Commissioning, plant System Experts, the PSM Committee, and the county Fire Marshall to assure code compliance. The facility maintenance plan incorporates the requirements of ANSI K61.1 and the guidance of the Compressed Gas Association?s CGA G-2 ? 1995 ?Anhydrous Ammonia? and the Nationa"

      "SummaryText": "l Board?s ?Stress Corrosion Cracking of Steel in Liquefied Ammonia Service.?\n\nEPA?s RMP Comp software was also chosen for the alternative case scenario.  The most serious release reasonably likely to happen would be the result of a liquid transfer hose failure.  This failure would release up to 20 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Several steps have been taken to prevent this from occurring.  Measures taken on the basis of the PSM Committee?s review include inspections and tests of hoses, connections, relief valves, and emergency shutoff valves as well as the use of wheel chocks, running water, transfer safety checklists; and proper operator training.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nRelease prevention at RMEC is in compliance with EPA?s Risk Management Program standard, OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard, OSHA?s Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia standard, and the UFC Hazardous Materials Management System guidelines.  RMEC has taken several technical and administrative steps beyond those specified in the standards to prevent releases.  Passive mitigation includes a secondary containment berm and redundant storage and handling equipment.  A deluge system provides active mitigation.\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nRMEC is a new facility and has no history of accidental releases.\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nAll RMEC personnel are trained to the first responder / awareness level, in the emergency response plan, and facility safety and environmental procedures.  They are also trained in OSHA 500 topics and Calpine?s Safety Culture.  Most employees have additional responsibilities and training under the facility?s Emergency Response procedure.  Coordination with local emergency responders is accomplished through the 9-1-1 system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nRMEC is a new facility, which has established Safety, Environmental, and PSM committees that will continue to improve site and public safety.
