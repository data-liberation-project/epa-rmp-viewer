Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Ventura Coastal - Visalia will manage this program like other regulations with our management team updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Ventura Coastal - Visalia, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Ventura Coastal - Visalia has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                           | Process Chemical             | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration          Anhydrous Ammonia              17,000\nNew Freezer                                 Anhydrous Ammonia              4,000 \n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The Concentrate Chiller, Cold Wall Tanks C-G, and Silo 2 are equipped with accumulators as required for flooded operation. In this system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to the liquid recirculators, ceiling-suspended evaporators, and some jacketed storage tanks, heat exchangers, and accumulators. The liquid recirculators are equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the liquid recirculators. Low pressure liquid is pumped from the liquid recirculators to the penthouse evaporators, and various jacketed storage tanks and heat exchangers located throughout the facility. \n\nThe evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. In the jacketed storage tanks, the low temperature liquid is pumped into piping within the tank that extends around the tank wall. In the plate and frame heat exchangers, the low temperature l"

      "SummaryText": "iquid flows through channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the product on the opposite side of each plate. In the shell and tube heat exchanger, the low pressure liquid enters the vessel shell and absorbs heat from the product piped through the interior of the heat exchanger. As the liquid ammonia absorbs heat from the product or air, it evaporates to form low temperature and pressure vapor and returns to the liquid recirculators. From the liquid recirculators, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\nThe system also includes direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coils. In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receiver directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within each condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. \n\nSafety Systems\n\nAt an ammonia concentration of 25 ppm, an alarm is activated on the PLC, and necessary personnel are automatically notified via email. At 50 ppm, the muster system is activated which includes activating a blue light (blue indicates ammonia) inside the production rooms."

      "SummaryText": "Additionally, the muster system will activate audible alarms plant-wide at 50 ppm. At an ammonia concentration inside the machinery room exceeding 150 ppm, the compressors are automatically shut down. The compressors are also shut down in the event that a sensor located in a production area reaches 80 ppm. \n\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) roof-mounted emergency ventilation fans. The New Freezer machinery Room has a single (1) roof mounted emergency fan. The emergency ventilation systems can be controlled manually by the HAND/OFF/AUTO switches or the emergency break glass switches outside each machinery room door, and automatically by the RCS above 25 ppm.\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. The high side of each system relieves at either 250 or 300 psig while the low side of each system relieves at 150 or 250 psig. All pressure relief valves vent to the atmosphere.\nEach recirculator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\nThe Emergency Pressure Control System (EPCS) operates as follows: \n- EPCS is activated at not greater than 90% pressure relief valve setting (e.g. 270 psig or less) [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.3] \n- Upon activation, all compressors are stopped by a means that is independent of all other safety controls [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n- Upon activation, cross-over valve is opened [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.6] \n- Upon activation, a signal is provided to personnel responsible for refrigeration system maintenance [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.7] \n- EPCS remains active until manually reset [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.5.8]\n- EPCS crossover isolation valves are locked open [ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Appendix I.4.4.2] \n- The emergency pressure control system"

During these meeting we also discuss \npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nVentura Coastal - Visalia has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in in this document and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Ventura Coastal - Visalia facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The Main ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 17,000 (LBS) and the New separate Freezer has a charge of 4,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident Hi"
