All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to. Pacific International Cooling\u00bfs emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. It is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific International Cooling facility in Yuma utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their precooling, cold rooms and process water chilling operations. Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat. The produce is then stored in a cold storage warehouse. The facility holds 16,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration process. \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n(c)\tTraining of the operators.\r\n(d)\tPreventative maintenance program.\r\n(e)\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\r\n(f)\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures.\r\n(g)\tPerformance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\r\n(h)\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nChemical specific prevention steps including awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of these toxic substances.\r\n\r\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPacific International Cooling will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program includes an emergency response notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted once every year; emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
