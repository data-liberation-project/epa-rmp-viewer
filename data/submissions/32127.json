The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of ConAgra International Fertilizer are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the \nmanagement plan in those meetings. The facility maintains an internal emergency \ncontingency plan.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work \nwith local fire departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize \nthe impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \nindustry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, \nhere after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, store, and used in the \nproduction of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important source \nof Nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and fall of the year.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility is 52,530 pounds.  The typical \nmethod of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds. The \ntransports are unloaded into the stationary storage tank.  A pump transfers the ammonia \nto the batch process. Batch process is not continuous but is operated intermittently. \n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards  \nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and \nmaintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Process Safety Program \nthat dovetai"

All employees involved with the \nhandling and processing are trained in their duties. The Facility continues to review and \nlook for means to improve operating and Best management Practices for increase safety. \n\nIV. The Five-Year Accident History:\n       \nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \nin the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \nat the Facility.  \n         \nTo the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \nproperty  damage or environmental damage has occurred due to the operation of this \nfacility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  \"Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \nAgricultural\" 1991.\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  \"Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \nFertilizer Institute.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \"Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \nPrevention Advisory ?
