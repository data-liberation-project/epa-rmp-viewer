To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" section of this manual has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\n\n\nThis facility processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  High pressure gas from field wells is sent to a gas plant whereby NGL liquids are extracted and stored in one 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe NGL is a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane and pentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane).\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" part of this manual as prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss NGL which is the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accident as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\n\n\nBecause this facility is a Program 2 covered process, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this manual,"

Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\n\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
