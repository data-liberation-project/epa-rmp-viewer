IF AN EMERGENCY WERE TO OCCUR, IT IS OUR POLICY TO NOTIFY THE WINTERSET FIRE DEPARTMENT AND REQUEST THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY. THIS FACILITY MANUFACTURES AUTOMOTIVE FUEL FILTRATION AND REGULATION SYSTEMS. THE FACILITY IS LOCATED ON A 155,000 sq/ft PARCEL WITH A 44,000 SQ/FT BUILDING. THE AMMONIA IS USED AS FUEL FOR HEAT TREATMENT AND BRAZEMENT OF STAINLESS STEEL AUTOMOTIVE FUEL FILTER ASSEMBLIES. THIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 2 - 1,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS AND ASSOCIATED PIPING, VALVES, BURNERS, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT. OUR WORST CASE SCENARIO IS FAILURE OF ONE 1,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO CAPACITY. ACCORDING TO RMP-COMP THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 1.3 MILES, WITH 187 EST. RESIDENTIAL POPULATION WITHIN THAT AREA. THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH THE E.P.A. ACCIDENT PREVENTION RULE, O.S.H.A. P.S.M. PROGRAM RULES, AND ALL OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL CODES AND REGULATIONS. WITHIN THE PAST 5 YEARS WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING AMMONIA THAT CAUSED DEATH, INJURY, PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, EVACUATIONS, OR SHELTERINGS IN PLACE. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, IT IS OUR POLICY, AS STATED ABOVE, TO CONTACT THE WINTERSET FIRE DEPARTMENT AND REQUEST THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS POLICY WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REQUESTED THAT THEY MAKE A SITE VISIT TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH OUR FACILITY. AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE NO PENDING CHANGES TO OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES."
