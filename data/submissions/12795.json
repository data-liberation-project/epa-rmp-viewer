The accidental reliase prevention and emergency response policies at our facility.\n\nFarmers Coop complies with ANSI K-61 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify Daykin Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of our facility and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertiliezers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks is 230,944 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-case release scenario.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. An excess flow valve and an emergency shutdown system have been considered for active mitigation and they will help control the release.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  Five year accident history.\n\nWe never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia "

The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the mainteneance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
