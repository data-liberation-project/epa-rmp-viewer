      "SummaryText": "FACILITY NAME\nCraig Generating Station (Craig Station)\n\nFACILITY POLICIES & PROGRAMS\nCraig Station is a 1264 MW coal-fired steam electric generating unit located near Craig, Colorado.  Craig Station is owned and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. (Tri-State).  As a Tri-State facility, Craig Station operates under the direction of the Tri-State Board of Directors.  The Tri-State Board of Directors have developed environmental health and safety policies requiring compliance with all applicable regulations.  These policies have been implemented for the protection of the employees, the public, and the environment.  To further the goals of the board environmental policies, Tri-State management has also implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS), which is used to help set and achieve environmental goals, as well as to ensure environmental compliance.  \n\nIn addition to the compliance policies of the board of directors and the EMS, Craig Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prepare for and provide a coordinated response to emergency situations.  The integrated approach is used to coordinate all aspects of emergency planning and response to provide for a comprehensive response to emergency situations.  The Risk Management Plan is incorporated into the ICP to ensure that the Risk Management Plan requirements are taken into consideration in the facility emergency planning and response efforts.  Additional information on the ICP can be found in the Emergency Response Program section below. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe primary function of the Craig Station is to generate electric power for use throughout the region. Steam electric power generation involves burning fuel to heat water and produce steam.  The steam produced is used to spin a large turbine, which in turn rotates a generator that converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy for use by consumers.  The primary fuel use"

      "SummaryText": "d at Craig Station is coal, with natural gas or fuel oil used as the start-up fuel.    \n\nWater is used at Craig Station as an integral part of the power production process.  The majority of the water used by the station is for cooling with a portion being treated to produce potable water and process water.  Raw water for the plant is pumped from the nearby Yampa River into an on-site raw water pond.   The water then undergoes treatment to make it suitable for the processes.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at Craig Station in amounts greater than the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds, 1,500 pounds and 2,500 pounds respectively.  Chlorine is used at the station to disinfect the water and prevent biological growth within the water systems.  The use of chlorine in the circulating (cooling) water systems helps to increase the efficiency and lifetime of the process, as well as to reduce the maintenance demands of the system.\n\nThere are two chlorine systems at Craig Station.  One for the treatment of the Unit 1 & 2 circulating water and one for the treatment of the Unit 3 circulating water. Both systems operate under a vacuum, which draws chlorine directly from the cylinder regulators into the process.  A vacuum type system is used to minimize the need for pressurized lines.  The elimination of pressurized lines minimizes the potential for a large release and helps ensure the safety of the employees and the surrounding community. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nThe Unit 1 & 2 and Unit 3 circulating water chlorine processes both require a level three prevention program due to applicability of the OSHA PSM standard to each process.  To meet this requirement Craig Station has developed an integrated PSM/RMP for both chlorine systems. Due to the similarity of the RMP and PSM rules, an integrated approach was used to ensure compliance, eliminate redundancy, and simplify documentation.  \n\nThe Craig St"

      "SummaryText": "ation RMP/PSM Prevention Program includes detailed information on the following topics:  program management, employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis requirements, standard operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and audits.  Each of the prevention program elements listed above is included as an integral part of the RMP/PSM program and the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). This approach ensures that the chlorine system requirements are considered during emergency planning and response activities at the station.  Portions of the PSM/RMP prevention program are also integrated into the facility work management system to ensure that PSM/RMP activities and considerations are addressed during routine maintenance activities at the station.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nCraig Station is committed to ensuring the safety of its workers, the safety of the surrounding community, and the protection of the environment.  To this end, Craig Station maintains relationships with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee.  In addition, Craig Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to meet all OSHA and EPA emergency response requirements.  The ICP assists in the evaluation of risks and in the preparation for and response to all types of emergencies.  The ICP sets forth procedures for emergency response and required notifications of the public and government agencies.  The ICP also details the emergency response organization, the training requirements, and the required maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents at the Craig Station in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evaculations, sheltering in place, property damage, or"
