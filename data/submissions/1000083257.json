The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for Gilmore Gas Plant is coordinated with the Hidalgo County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  Gilmore Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nGilmore Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at Gilmore Gas Plant.\r\n\r\n* Gilmore Plant is currently planning to install additional gas detectors and alarms in response to a recommendation from a comprehensive facility siting study."

All three of the plants are designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and are assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.     Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\r\n\r\nListed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Gilmore Gas Plant are a mixed hydrocarbon (Y-Grade) liquid product containing propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and normal pentane.  Flammable inlet and residue gas is also present in the plant but do not exceed the threshold quantity.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Armstrong Gas Plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  \r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe processes at the Armstrong Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.
