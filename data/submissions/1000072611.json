(PowerSouth).\n\n\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nEmployee safety and environmental protection are the drivers for PowerSouth policies at our Lowman Power Station.  In our view, environmental protection includes the health and welfare of the community surrounding Lowman.  This is why PowerSouth has installed air quality control equipment to reduce air pollution, to includle a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions, which uses ammonia as the most efficient chemical in the industry to accomplish this reduction.  The use of ammonia initially led PowerSouth to develop and implement a risk management plan to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  Since then, the Lowman Plant also switched to chlorine in its water treatment processes, the most effective and economical biocide of choice, and the chlorine process was added to the previous RMP plan.  A description of the RMP plan is included below. \n\n\n\nPowerSouth is committed to environmental leadership in managing its generating station for the public benefit, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power.  PowerSouth also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, which include the safe and responsible use of chemicals for air pollution reduction.  PowerSouth management and employees are responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.  Beyond the development and implementation of this RMP, PowerSouth's commitment to environmental protection extends to the review of new developments in safe technologies"

      "SummaryText": ", operating procedures, and emergency preparedness.  All such activities are conducted in accordance with the most current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPowerSouth is the supplier of electricity for residents and businesses in 39 Alabama counties and 10 Florida counties. Lowman Power Station was built in the 1960s to answer the increasing electric demand of a growing rural area.  The first Lowman generator placed on line was Lowman 1 in 1969, with a maximum capacity of 86 MW.  It was followed by Unit 2 and 3, 258 MW units in 1979 and 1980, respectively.  \n\n\n\nAll Lowman units are designed to burn coal.  Particulate emissions from the three units are controlled by electrostatic precipitators. In addition, all three units are now equipped with flue gas desulfurization systems (scrubbers) to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Additionally, Units 2 and 3 are also now equipped with SCR units for the reduction of NOx emissions.\n\n\n\nThe SCR process requires ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facility includes two 30,000-gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, forwarding pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection components to inject ammonia into the SCR emission control system.  For the purpose of the RMP, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are the only regulated substances at the facility above a RMP reporting threshold amount.  With two 30,000-gallon storage tanks, the potential maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored in the facility at any time is 310,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 154,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Lowman Plant also uses chlorine to disinfect process water used for the wet scrubbers used to removed particulate matter and sulfur dioxide and to disinfect cooling tower water and clarifier effluent.

Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for each toxic chemical were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility. \n\n\n\n IV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program is arguably the most important element of the RMP.  Its successful implementation requires the active participation of plant employees and managers in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If a prevention program could be perfect, there would be little need for emergency response activities, since no unexpected releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program lowers the possibility of an accidental release and minimizes the consequences of a release should one occur.  The prevention programs for the Lowman SCR and chlorination processes consist of twelve elements, which are briefly described here.\n\n\n\nA.  Employee Participation - PowerSouth believes in a team approach to process safety management and accident prevention in which employees are routinely consulted in these matters.  Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information developed through implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.  These policies are contained in a written employee participation plan that is part of the RMP.\n\n\n\nB.

This information was used as the basis for the Process Hazard Analyses and is readily available for review and reference by employees.\n\n\n\nC.  Process Hazard Analysis - PowerSouth conducted detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the process to ensure that the hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess these hazards for the SCR process.  The analyses, in the form of workshops, were conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations and facilitated by a person trained in the assessment methodology used.  The findings and recommendations that resulted from the workshops were addressed.  The What-If analysis of the ammonia system was conducted on December 11 - 13, 2006.  A pre-startup safety review of the system was conducted prior to the ammonia arriving on-site.  The HAZOP methodology was used to assess the hazards for the chlorination process.  The HAZOP was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety, and process operations and facilitated by a person trained in the assessment methodology used.  The findings and recommendations that resulted from the HAZOP were addressed.  The chlorine HAZOP was conducted on May 28, 2008.  A pre-startup safety review of the system was conducted prior to startup of the chlorination process.  Since then, another PHA was conducted on 12/06/2011 and the findings addressed as appropriate.\n\n\n\nD.  Operating Procedures - PowerSouth has established and maintains procedures for safely conducting activities related to the SCR and chlorination processes.  The procedures cover the required operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a t"

The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nE.  Training - PowerSouth's training program, as it relates to the SCR and chlorination processes, has been implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the workings of the process and are knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  These personnel were given initial training and will be provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\n\n\nF.  Contractors - PowerSouth develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and maintain generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, PowerSouth evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including its safety performance.  Written procedures are in place to ensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work on or near the regulated process, including the emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nG.  Pre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of each new process.  Established pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures were suitable for a safe startup before actually placing the process equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nH.  Mechanical Integrity - PowerSouth conducts well-documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations.

      "SummaryText": ", PowerSouth will submit the required Risk Management Plan correction within six months of an accident of this nature should one occur.\n\n\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Part 68 rule distinguishes between those facilities that will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and those that will not.  The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  For these facilities, an emergency action plan is required.  For a responding facility, the requirements are covered in Section 68.95 of the rule and a much more comprehensive emergency response plan is needed.  \n\n\n\nTo determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of \"response\" is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3) and is defined as a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders  to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.  If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing in magnitude, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\n\n\nPowerSouth has an emergency action plan in place to address accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes such requirements as adequate first-aid and medical treatment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident response and decontamination of affected areas.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPowerSouth is always receptive to suggestions from employees to improve safety.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly.  Further, employees are trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.  The many recommendations made during the process hazard analyses have been considered for implementation."
