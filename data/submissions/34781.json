      "SummaryText": "The Akzo Nobel McCook Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Akzo Nobel has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this site and that complies with the requirements of the EPA's regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Akzo Nobel McCook Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of this facility's risk management program.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAkzo Nobel is committed to the safety of their workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  It is company policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  It is necessary to observe safety precautions in handling hazardous substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to their own personal health as well as their co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Akzo Nobel implements reasonable controls including safety devices inherent in the design of the facility combined with safe handling procedures and provides proper training to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  \"NO ONE WORKS TO GET HURT\" is a corporate slogan that defines the company?s emphasis on safety.\n\nIn the event of a significant accidental release, the emergency response system will be activated and the Plant?s trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Akzo Nobel evaluates each situa"

Akzo Nobel and the fire department have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\n\n2.  The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAt the Akzo Nobel McCook Plant, a wide variety of industrial surfactants are produced from naturally occurring fats from the meat packing industry and from vegetable oils.  These raw materials are used to produce fatty acids and amines, which are then reacted with other chemicals that include Ethylene Oxide, Methyl Chloride and Propylene Oxide to produce over 200 products.  These materials have many applications and find their way into products used daily by most people.  Many of the items that you buy at the store, such as laundry detergents, fabric softeners, hair shampoos and conditioners, plastic wrap and plastic bags are made with our products.\n\nThere are two production units onsite in which the Plant handles three toxic substances regulated by the RMP rule that exceed the listed threshold quantities and these are Methyl Chloride, Ethylene Oxide, and Propylene Oxide.  All of these covered processes are eligible for program level 3. \n\n3. Consequence Analysis\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n5. Five Year Accident History\n6.
