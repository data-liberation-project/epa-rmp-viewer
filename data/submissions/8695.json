      "SummaryText": "BUNGE FOODS CORPORATION- MEXICO MISSOURI\n\n1.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBunge Foods Corporation (Bunge) owns and operates a bakery product manufacturing facility located in Mexico, Missouri.  On site, Bunge has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration and freezing of bakery products made at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) '68.130.\n\nSince the quantity of ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Bunge is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Mexico facility which includes three (3) major elements:  hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Bunge.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the deadline of June 21, 1999.\n\nBunge is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this report, Bunge is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBunge is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\n1.2    Description of Bunge and the Regulated Substance Handled\nBunge operates a bakery products manufacturing facility in Mexico, MO.  Bunge produces fresh bread products which are then frozen and shipped to various restaurants nationwide.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary freezing of the product"

      "SummaryText": " for shipment.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself.  There is approximately 26,238 pounds of ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n1.3    Worst Case Scenario\nSection '68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. \n\nAt Bunge, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest vessel containing ammonia.  The largest tank (12,680 lb) is assumed to instantaneously release the entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The ammonia will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA's dispersion modeling software DEGADIS and shows that the toxic endpoint will reach a toxic endpoint distance of 1.1 miles. This release would affect residential populations. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a 1/4 inch rupture of process piping.  This failure will conservatively assume that 2,916 pounds of ammonia will release for 45 minutes from the roof of the facility (30 feet above ground).  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA's dispersion modeling software SLAB and shows that the toxic endpoint will reach a toxic endpoint of 0.13 miles.  This release would affect a residential population of one.  \n\n1.4    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBunge has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. Bunge has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.  All inspection and testing procedures are contained within this program and are issued as required to the Bunge-personnel for completion.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system"

      "SummaryText": ".  These include an interlock system, alarms, and ammonia detectors located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n1.5    Five year Accident History\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia as outlined in '68.42 of the RMP Regulations.  \n\n1.6    The Emergency Response Program\nBunge's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal Regulations.  These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, Bunge will react with the proper actions, as listed in the Emergency Response Plan, in association with the local fire department and City of Mexico, MO Public Safety Department.\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nBunge makes safety a first priority in its every day operations to ensure a safe working environment for all of its employees.  Bunge is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the Bunge facility.  Recommendations from that PHA are being implemented which will improve the safety of the ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any ammonia spill."
