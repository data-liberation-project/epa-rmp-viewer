      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nOur Company THE FARMERS COOPERATIVE ELEVATOR COMPANY, INC strives to maintain a safe work place.  Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan for prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The activity of this company is the retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as fertilizer for crop production.\n\nOur plant consists of 1-30,000 gallon and 1-12,500 gallon  anhydrous ammonia tanks.  The maximum quantity stored  (filled at 85%) is 186,000lbs.  The worse case release scenario would be a release of 131,000 pounds of  NH3, over a ten minute period and has the potential to affect a total of  40 area residents.  Distance to end point in a worse case scenario would be 2.6 miles from our plant.  The alternative release would be 11,908bs. Release (transfer hose failure) in approximately 2 minutes.  This release scenario would have a distance to endpoint of .83 miles, still affecting the same 40 residents.\n\nOur plant is maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are trained on a regular basis on the proper procedures to operate the plant as well as the procedures to fill a nurse tank.  Our workers always have safety water on hand and wear the proper personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during ammonia operations.\n\nThe company is proud to report that there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years resulting in injury, property damage, death, evacuation, sheltering in place, or other emergency procedures.\n\nOur emergency response plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and area emergency responders.  Our company's emergency response plan is shared with the local fire department and the county LEPC.  First responders will be given a tour of our facility and in return they've agreed to assist us in the event of an emergency or accidental ammonia"
