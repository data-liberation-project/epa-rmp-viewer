The facility is inspected yearly by what we consider two entities. These are the NC department of Enviromental Health, Public Water section and NC League of Municipalities. We feel that working closely with these agencies has provided us with the necessary information to continuously adhere to all appilicable federal and state regulations pertaining to chlorine. Our training involves local emergency agencies and it is a written policy of PSM of this facility to notify the Shelby Fire Department of any release in order for them to respond and investigate.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULSTED SUSTANCES HANDLED: THE Shelby Water Treatment facility has the capability of treating 12 million-gallons a day of water which is fed by the First Broad River. The regulated substance on site for water treatment purposes is Chlorine which is used as a disinfectant in water.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO: Our worst-case scenario is based on a release of a one ton cyclinder filled with 2,000 pounds of chlorine resulting in the total release of the entire cylinder product over a ten-minute period at a approximately 1.5m/sec wind speed. According to the EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to the end point is 1.3 miles of urban terrian.  This release has the potential to spread in an area containing 2 schools, 3 convalescent centers, a 261 - bed unit hospital, and a prison annex facility. The projected population of the effected area is approximately 6,700 people. However, because of written procedures that comply with OSHA PSM standards and their enforcement along with training on such procedures and scenarios, a release of this magitude is highly unlikly. Also items in place such as leak detectors for the detection of product less than 1 part per million and a vacuum system that stops th"

According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to the end point is projected to be 0.10 miles. This release would not have a significant impact to the surrounding residential community. Due to enforced written procedures and policies and checklists that comply with OSHA PSM standard and state and federal guidelines a scenario to this effect is extremely unlikely. Detection systems, procedures and automatic shutdown devices help to prevent such a release.\n\n                                                                                         THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  This water treatment facility complies with OSHA 1910.119 regulation for accident prevention rules and other state and federal regulations that are applicable for the safety of its employees and citizens.  For critical operations, which chlorine, personnel working in pairs and checklist for such operations along with back up systems create a more competent prevention program. All accidents that occur at the facility, whether they are chemical related or not, are investigated to prevent the same mistake from occuring and to display a commitment to safety. \n\n                                                                                         FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: This facility has not had an accidental release during the"

The Cleveland County hazardous materials team is also a part of the response protocol. Involvement with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and training with local agencies to understand roles and responsibilities are all items this facility has incorporated into its program. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The City of Shelby implemented a Preventative Maintenance Program for the Chlorine Feed System.  An annual preventative maintenance is performed on all feed equipment used by the City of Shelby.  The City has vacuum chlorinators that automatically stops the flow of chlorine gas if the vacuum is breached. This facility has a good working  and training relationship with the Shelby Police and Fire Departments along with the Local Emergency Planning committee. With technology constantly changing, the City of Shelby continue to evaluate ways to improve  safety and operations of its facility along with ways to reduce inventory of regulated substances."
