              "Description": "Liquified ammonia is a raw material to produce nitric acid in one unit.  FCC receives ammonia predominately by pipeline and infrequently by rail car.  The ammonia is stored in one tank.   Therefore the  preventive program concentrates on monitoring the tank integrity, loading and unloading of the storage tank, the pressure relief valve, operating pumps, and piping.  Because this ammonia process is dedicated to one production process and two unloading processes,  the prevention program has very little variability.",

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation (FCC) has two chemicals on-site that exceeds the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as established in the 1990 Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and described in detail in 40 CFR 68.  These chemical are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine. Anhydrous ammonia has a single designated storage tank and is used as a raw material in a certain discrete process.  FCC receives ammonia principally by pipeline and infrequently by rail car. The unloading processes are continuously monitored. Chlorine is delivered on site in pressurized cylinders and is used in one discrete production process as well at two separate cooling towers for water treatment. \n\n\n\nThere is no flammable gas worst-case release scenario because FCC does not store any RMP flammable chemicals above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nUsing the EPA defined process, an ammonia tank rupture represents FCC's worst-case toxic chemical release scenario.  The ammonia alternative release scenario is a complete relief valve failure.  Unlike the worst-case scenario definition, the EPA allows companies to assume Operator response to reduce the off-site consequence of the alternative release scenario, as long as the consequence goes off-site.  The chlorine worst case scenario involves the loss of the contents of 5 cylinders stored next to each other, but not manifolded together, due to over pressurization. The alternative case involves the loss of the contents of one cylinder.\n\n\n\nIf either of these highly unlikely events ever occurred, FCC has an Emergency Response Plan in place. For the alternative scenario release, while the Shift Supervisor would be making emergency notification, an Operator would immediately prepare to close the emergency manual shut-off valve between the relief valve and the ammonia storage tank.  This process would take no more than twenty minutes.\n\n\n\nOther Operators would be designated to assist this Operator and would oper"

In addition, the water deluge valves would be activated on the ammonia tank storage area.\n\n\n\nFCC utilizes OSHA's PSM program to reduce the likelihood that this worst-case release or the alternative release never occurs.  There are formal review programs beginning with the initial determination to produce a product, continue through the entire premanufacture process, and are ongoing after manufacture begins.  Listed below are some of the formal procedures used to insure the safe storage of ammonia:\n\n \n\n1)  Equipment selection is part of a formal review by Certified Professional Engineers.  In the case of this ammonia tank, the selected tank had a one and three sixteenths steel wall thickness. Independent companies performed ultrasonic tests and the Brunell Hardness Test on the tank to certify the tank meets the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ammonia storage tank requirements.\n\n\n\n2)  FCC staff performed a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) before process startup.  Any change to the equipment or any modification to the tank or piping require the PHA to be repeated.  One concern identified in this analysis was the possibility of the pressure relief valve venting.  While the relief valve is a required piece of equipment, if it vented and failed to reseat, the PHA analysis revealed the release could be significant.  The PHA required the relief valve to be removed annually and inspected by an independent, certified inspector to insure the valve parts would be maintained and inspected regularly.  In addition, since overfilling would cause the relief valve to activate, FCC installed an automatic high level shut-off valve and alarm.  Automatic \n\nshut-off valves were installed on each fill and discharge line.\n\n\n\n3)  Operating procedures are written and available to all Operators for safe handling and storage transfers.   FCC has a formal Management of Change procedure detailing in w"

Competency is determined by written and oral testing.  After this initial testing, FCC has ongoing training for operating and safety analysis, as well as hazard response.  Each shift has members on the Emergency Response Team, which receives additional emergency response training.\n\n\n\n5)  A formal preventative maintenance program is in place to monitor the integrity of the tank, lines and pumps.  FCC performs an ultrasonic testing of the tank every 5 years.  The tank is emptied and internally inspected every 10 years.  Operators visually inspect the tank, lines and pump several times a shift.  The pumps are formally checked every week.\n\n\n\n6) FCC only uses vendor approved chlorine cylinders.\n\n\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation has not had a release of any RMP chemical that has had off-site health or injury consequences for the past five years.  The scenarios described above are hypothetical and have never occurred at this location.\n\n\n\nIf a release should occur that would create an off-site hazard, FCC will immediately notify the Industrial Park industries and emergency responders in the community.  The Fire and Police Departments will notify the community of the status of the release and the actions to take using public address systems.  These actions will depend upon the direction of wind, the amount of the material released, and the length of the release.  These actions may include shelter-in-place or evacuation.  Local radio and television stations will be notified and will assist in notifying the public of the proper actions to take.\n\n\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation has many written programs in place to prevent accidental releases of chemicals into the environment.

A Work Order and Hot Work procedure are utilized for maintenance and contractor activities.   In addition, the Maintenance Department has written procedures specifying critical tests, calibration for instruments, and pump and tank inspections.  Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) are performed for every process before construction begins, making sure that all factors of safe storage and handling of the chemicals are considered and safety measures are incorporated into the unit.  FCC updates PHAs every 5 years or more frequently if process piping or a tank is modified.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Team has designated members and emergency response \n\nequipment, conducts frequent training on response techniques, and regularly performs a emergency response drills.  The Emergency Response Team is made up of employees from each shift.  The Emergency Responders are trained in all hazard response and safety procedures and receive formal training in emergency response.  The written Emergency Response Plan establishes responsible personnel and contains emergency telephone numbers and notification requirements.  FCC will respond immediately and systematically to any spill or release emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Chemical Corporation and its employees are committed to storing and producing chemicals in a manner that will protect the environment and the health of the community.
