We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAt this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety management systems.  In addition, we are investigating the possibilities for containment of our railcar-unloading site and continue to improve the computerized process control system as outlined in our hazard review.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Atlanta Foam Plant, as part of the Woodbridge Group of companies, believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, is the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\nComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\nReview and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental  improvements.\n\nOur complete Heath Safety & Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility. \n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manger, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Atlanta Foam Plant is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry.
