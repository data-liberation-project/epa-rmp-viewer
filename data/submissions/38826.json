If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Saginaw Fire Department and the Eagle Mountain Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Also, StyroChem has a contract agreement with Garner Environmental Services to respond in case of some specific types of releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \r\nThis facility is a polystyrene manufacturing facility.  We plan to start Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) production in 1999.  This process will use pentane.  Pentane impregnates polystyrene beads and converts them into EPS.  The system will consist of two storage tanks, one or more reactor(s), and associated pipes, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenario:  \r\nPer EPA requirements, our worst-case scenario is a failure of a Triblend pentane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There are no schools, hospitals, or parks within the distance to the endpoint.  The facility adjoins with other businesses and abandoned residential houses only.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenario:  \r\nOur alternative scenario is a pipe rupture resulting in a pool fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  \r\nThe facility will comply with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The pentane system is designed and will be installed and maintained taking into account similar StyroChem facilities manufacturing EPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:  \r\nNo accidents involving pentane have ever happened at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency response program:  \r\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the Saginaw Fire Department, the Eagle Mountain Fire Department, and Garner Environmental Services and request th"

We have discussed this policy with the fire departments and LEPC representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:   \r\nSimilar processes at two other StyroChem facilities were analyzed during the preparation of the equipment installation to provide a safe environment for the workers and neighbors.  All elements of the Risk Management Program will be addressed prior to start-up and operation.  A procedure will be written to limit the fill level of the storage tanks to 90% or less.  This will reduce the endpoint distance of potential impact.  StyroChem believes that safety is a never-ending process.  We will continue to evaluate and improve safety for the life of the process."
