      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) New Carlisle, IN Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the New Carlisle Facility located at 54300 Walnut Road, New Carlisle, IN 46552.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the New Carlisle Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the New Carlisle Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena Chemical Company is submitting this as a 5-year update.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility were reviewed and/or updated. The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe New Carlisle Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates two (2) covered processes that include Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling (stationary storage tank) of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a railcar (34,000 gallons) or commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferred to the single (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  If by Railcar, trained H"

      "SummaryText": "elena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia.  If by commercial truck, the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (1) 18 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and (2) 23 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for two covered processes that are conducted at this Facility.  The two covered processes include anhydrous ammonia Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility was the same for both covered processes and assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released over a 10-minute period.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 34,000-gallon railcar that is delivered in the winter months.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was different for each covered process.  The alternative scenario for the Railcar Storage assumes a 60-minute release from a Railcar vapor valve that was not completely closed.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30 second release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena "

      "SummaryText": "staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes the Chemical Inventory, Offsite Consequence Analysis, Management System, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena's New Carlisle Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the New Carlisle Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the New Carlisle Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the New Carlisle Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the St. Joseph County LEPC and New Carlisle, Olive-Hudson Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the New Carlisle Facility.\n\n"
