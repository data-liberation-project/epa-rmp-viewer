Treated water is distributed to residential, commercial, and industrial users. The Plant can hold a maximum intended inventory of 80,000 pounds of chlorine in two 20-ton tanks. Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and can hold a maximum intended inventory of 14,000 pounds in two tanks. The inventory volume of each chemical is above the respective threshold quantities established by the Environmental Protection Agency. As a result, the Plant is subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nInitial operation of the facility by the City began in March 2003.  No accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia meeting the requirements of the five-year accident history, as defined in the Risk Management Program regulations, have occurred at the facility to date.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine and ammonia feed systems and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine and ammonia systems are documented, and each system is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine and ammonia systems. When a major process change is made to either chemical system, procedures are in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia systems are also in place for the Plant.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by facility personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nPlant operators receive training in the operatio"

Competency is determined through supervisor observation, operator demonstration of activities, and oral tests. Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine and ammonia systems.\n\nA team of City personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations. A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, procedures are in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nMembers of the Plant Emergency Response Team (ERT) are trained, qualified, and equipped to respond to significant chlorine and/or ammonia releases at the Plant. The ERT coordinates response training with the Denton Fire Department. The facility maintains an up-to-date emergency response plan that includes procedures for responding to chemical releases, notifying the public of chemical releases, providing emergency health care, and other emergency information. Plant personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine or ammonia release occurs, requiring the assistance of emergency response personnel, the Plant ERT and the Denton Fire Department are responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community.\n"
