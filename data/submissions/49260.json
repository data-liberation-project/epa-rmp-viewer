              "Description": "System:  Ammonia Compressors\n1.    Description of the process:   Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the lower pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) circuits.  #1 Circuit goes to the #1block cooler and #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.  \nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  Liquid Ammonia boils at -28 degrees F at atmospheric pressure.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure lower temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the \"Frick Computer\".  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.  A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bled valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n                                                                                                           MAJOR COMPONENT FUNCTIONS\n?    Ammonia Compressors:  There are five compressors all located in the engine room.  The compressors control the pressure on the suction side of the system; this function is to control the boiling point of ammonia in all of the system.  The current set point of the suction pressure is 34 PSIG.  The discharge vapor is sent to the condenser where the vapor is cooled to its condensing point, the condenser set point is 125 PSIG.  This controls the high pressures from the compressors.  All of the set points can be changed either from the \"Frick Computer\" or the microprocessors located on each compressor.\n\n2.    Equipment List\n1.    Compressors (Engine Room):\na.    One (1) Frick model RXF85 200 HP\nb.    Two (2) Frick model RXF68 150 HP\nc.    One (1) Frick model RXF101 250 HP\nd.    One (1) Frick model RWFII134 300 HP\n\n3.    Quantities\n?    The refrigeration system currently holds 13000 lbs of ammonia.\n?    The starter room receiver at any time could have as much as 2000 lbs.\n?    A catastrophic loss would result in the release of approximately 15000 lbs of ammonia.\n\n4.  Head Pressure:\n?    100-150 PSIG at the compressors\n?    Condensing pressure 125 PSIG\n\n5.  Suction pressure:\n?    27-42 PSIG\n\n6.  Liquid pump discharge pressure;\n?    68 PSIG normal operating\n\n7.  Desired process temperature:\n?    #1 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    #2 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    Shipping dock 33-35 F\n?    #1 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #2 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #1 Cold storage 43-45 F\n?    #2 Cold storage 43-45 F\n\n8.    Age of system:\n?    Operational July 2001\n?    Expansion May 2006\n\n9.    Number of employees that could be affected\n?    Total staff is approximately 75 - 85\n?    Per shift would be around 10 ? 25\n\n10.    Product contamination:\n?    Direct exposure minimal\n?    Spoilage would occur if there was a loss of refrigeration\n\n11.    Property Damage\n?    Structural damage only if fire or explosion would occur\n?    Possibility of equipment damage\n\n12.    Operating History:\n?    Very minimal.  A few small leaks under 1 pound, during the start-up and commissioning phase \n?    None since acceptance in July 2001\n?    A few small leaks under 1 pound during the pump downs and start up of the expansion\n\n13.    Consequences of deviation:\n?    The temperature of space (Block Cooler, Cold storage, Shipping dock) or liquid Glycol heat exchanger) would increase or decrease depending on how the system failed and what component failed.\n?    The evaporators are sized so that a loss of one of them in each space would not diminish the ability to cool.\n\n14.    Steps to correct the Deviation:\n?    The temperatures are monitored daily.  Alarms are in place so that any deviation from the set points would sound an audible alarm.  Based on which alarm is sounding will determine what course of action to take.\n\n15.    What tasks are performed here?:\n?    The temperature is monitored daily, each evaporator is visually inspected daily.\n?    Daily rounds are completed and documented on the compressors and condensers.\n\n16.    Is the equipment accessible?\n?    A ladder would be required to isolate receiver valves.\n\n17.    How difficult is it to understand and adjust the controls?:\n?    It takes minimal training to operate this equipment; the controls are very straightforward.\n?    Each operator has his/her own password to access the ?Frick? computer.\n\n18.    Are labels easy and clear to understand?\n?    All valves (manual, or electrically operated) have tags on them.\n?    All piping is labeled to content and direction of flow.\n\n19.    What are the safety warning systems?\n?    The temperatures that are monitored will give us an indication of equipment malfunction.\n?    The smell of ammonia will give an indication of a leak, there are also ammonia detectors throughout the plant that will alarm if the level reaches 25PPM in the cold storage, block cooler, and shipping dock.  A 50PPM will set off an alarm in the engine room.\n\n20.    Can the inventory of refrigerant be reduced or substituted to make this system safer?\n?    No.  The inventory is at a minimal level to make the system function.\n?    A changeover to a substitute refrigerant is not feasible.  All Equipment and piping sizes would have to be changed.  All refrigerant has its own characteristics and hazards.\n\n21.    Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?\n?    The automatic controls work very well, this system would be hard to operate manually, and there is always a risk of human error.\n\n22.    Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?\n?    No.  Each unit is separate; there are valves in place to isolate each area from the system.\n\n23.    Where are the nearest oil drains?\n?    Oil pot located under the LPR\n?    Under each glycol chiller\n\n24.    Where is the nearest water?\n?    There are eye wash stations in the engine room and dry storage area.\n\n25.    How would ventilation be performed?\n?    There are two roof exhaust fans in the engine room that can be turned on manually or will start automatically on temperature and ammonia level alarms.\n\n26.    Where are the relief lines and valves?\n?    Two located on the tank in the engine room\n?    King tank, LPR, Glycol Chiller, Frick Compressors (5),\no    All located on the equipment in the engine room.\nO    Glycol Chillers\n?    Oil Pot\no    One located on the pot beneath the LPR in the engine room.\n?    Condenser\no    Two located on the condenser located on the roof above the engine room.\n\n27.    The location of breakers and isolation valves:\n?    #1 Frick compressor, (as built number 3)\nBreaker is 1306 located in the switchgear room.  Valves are:\n?    MS1-1 Oil cooler inlet\n?    MS1-2 Suction\n?    MS1-3 Discharge\n?    MS1-4 Oil cooler outlet\n?    #2 Frick compressor, (as built number 2)\nBreaker is 1304 located in the switchgear room.  Valves are:\n?

              "Description": "System:  Ammonia Liquid Pumps                                     1.    Description of the process:  Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the low pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) different circuits.  Circuit #1 goes to #1 block cooler, #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.\nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  LIQUID AMMONIA BOILS AT ?28 DEGREES F AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of Ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure low temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the ?Frick Computer?.  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.   A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high Temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bleed valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n\n \n2.    Equipment List\ni.    Pumps\n1.

              "Description": "System:  Block Cooler\n1.    Description of the process:  Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the low pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) different circuits.  Circuit #1 goes to #1 block cooler, #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.\nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  LIQUID AMMONIA BOILS AT ?28 DEGREES F AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of Ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure low temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the ?Frick Computer?.  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.   A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high Temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bleed valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n\nMAJOR COMPONENT FUNCTIONS\n?    Block Cooler (cheese chilling tunnel):  The liquid ammonia goes through a pilot operated stop valve before entering a manifold, which connects four (4), coils.  An Intech SR46 controller monitors the preset temperature of the air entering the coils.  As the air temperature increases or decreases the controller will open or close the liquid stop valve.  The set points are entered from a touch panel located at the processor control panel.  There are four (4) fans associated with the block cooler.\n\n2.    Equipment List\n?    #1 Block Cooler \no    Manufactured by RealCold, New Zealand\no    Four (4) 10 HP fans\n?    #2 Block Cooler\no    Manufactured by RealCold, New Zealand\no    Four (4) 10 HP fans\n\n3.    Quantities\n?    The refrigeration system currently holds 13000 pounds of ammonia.\n?    The starter room receiver at any time could have as much as 2000 pounds.\n?    A catastrophic loss would result in the release of approximately 15000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n4.    Head pressure:\n?    100-150 PSIG at the compressors\n?    Condensing pressure 125 PSIG\n\n5.    Suction pressure:\n?    27-42 PSIG\n\n6.    Liquid pump discharge pressure;\n?    68 PSIG normal operating\n\n7.    Desired process temperature:\n?    #1 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    #2 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    Shipping dock 33-35 F\n?    #1 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #2 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #1 Cold storage 43-45 F\n?    #2 Cold storage 43-45 F\n\n8.    Age of system:\n?    Operational July 2001\n?    Expansion May 3006\n\n9.    Number of employees that could be affected\n?    Total staff is approximately 75 - 85\n?    Per shift would be around 10 - 25\n\n10.    Product contamination:\n?    Direct exposure minimal\n?    Spoilage would occur if there was a loss of refrigeration\n\n11.    Property Damage\n?    Structural damage only if fire or explosion would occur\n?    Possibility of equipment damage\n\n12.    Operating History:\n?    Very minimal.  A few small leaks under 1 pound, during the start-up and commissioning phase\n?    None since acceptance in July 2001\n?    A few small leaks under 1 pound during the pump downs and start up of the expansion\n\n13.    Consequences of deviation:\n?    The temperature of space (Block Cooler, Cold storage, Shipping dock) or liquid (Glycol heat exchanger) would increase or decrease depending on how the system failed and what component failed.\n?    The evaporators are sized to that a loss of one of them in each space would not diminish the ability to cool.\n\n14.    Steps to correct the Deviation:\n?    The temperatures are monitored daily.  Alarms are in place so that any deviation from the set points would sound an audible alarm.  Based on which alarm is sounding will determine what course of action to take.\n\n15.    What tasks are performed here?\n?    The temperature is monitored daily, each evaporator is visually inspected daily.\n?    Daily rounds are completed and documented on the compressors and condensers.\n\n16.    Is the equipment accessible?\n?    A ladder would be required in the block cooler.\n?    A man lift would be required in the cold storage, shipping dock, and select valves in the engine room.\n?    All other valves and controls are within reach.\n\n17.    How difficult is it to understand and adjust the controls?\n?    It takes minimal training to operate this equipment; the controls are very straightforward.\n?    Each operator has his/her own password to access the ?Frick? computer.\n\n18.    Are labels easy and clear to understand?\n?    All valves (manual, or electrically operated) have tags on them.\n?    All piping is labeled to content and direction of flow.\n\n19.    What are the safety warning systems?\n?    The temperatures that are monitored will give us an indication of equipment malfunction.\n?    The smell of ammonia will give an indication of a leak, there are also ammonia detectors throughout the plant that will alarm if the level reaches 25PPM in the cold storage, block cooler, and shipping dock.  A 50PPM will set off an alarm in the engine room.\n\n20.    Can the inventory of refrigerant be reduced or substituted to make this system safer?\n?    No.  The inventory is at a minimal level to make the system function.\n?    A changeover to a substitute refrigerant is not feasible.  All Equipment and piping sizes would have to be changed.

              "Description": "System:  Cold Storage and Shipping Dock\n1.    Description of the process:  Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the low pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) different circuits.  Circuit #1 goes to #1 block cooler, #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.\nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  LIQUID AMMONIA BOILS AT ?28 DEGREES F AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of Ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure low temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the ?Frick Computer?.  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.   A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high Temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bleed valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n\nMAJOR COMPONENT FUNCTIONS\n?    Cold storage, Shipping dock:  There are three (3) evaporators located in #1 cold storage, suspended from the ceiling.  There are three (3) additional evaporators located on the shipping dock also suspended from the ceiling and four (4) evaporators in #2 cold storage.  All ten (10) evaporators are an overfeed style, meaning that more liquid ammonia is pumped through them than what is allowed to boil.  The liquid vapor mixture is returned to the low-pressure receiver (LPR) to begin the cycle again.  The temperature probes located on the air inlet side monitor the set points; this probe is connected to the processor located in the engine room.  As any of the evaporators raise or lower in temperature a solenoid operated liquid valve opens or closes.  The evaporators in cold storage are set to defrost once (1) per week, the evaporators in the shipping dock are defrosted twice (2 times) daily.\n\n2.  Equipment List\n?    Plant:\ni.    #1 Cold storage\n?    Three (3) Frigid coil evaporators\n        1.5 HP fans\n        18.45 ton capacity each\n\nii.    Shipping Dock\n?    Three (3) Imeco evaporators\n        .3 HP fans\n        5 ton capacity each\n\niii.    #2 Cold storage\n?    Four (4) Frigid coil evaporators\n        1.5 HP fans\n        18.45 ton capacity each\n\n3.    Quantities\n?    The refrigeration system currently holds 9600 pounds of ammonia.\n?    The starter room receiver at any time could have as much as 2600 pounds.\n?    A catastrophic loss would result in the release of approximately 12000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n4.    Head pressure:\n?    100-150 PSIG at the compressors\n?    Condensing pressure 125 PSIG\n\n5.    Suction pressure:\n?    27-42 PSIG\n\n6.    Liquid pump discharge pressure;\n?    68 PSIG normal operating\n\n7.    Desired process temperature:\n?    #1 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    #2 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    Shipping dock 33-35 F\n?    #1 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #2 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #1 Cold storage 43-45 F\n?    #2 Cold storage 43-45 F    \n\n8.    Age of system:\n?    Operational July 2001\n?    Expansion May 2006\n\n9.    Number of employees that could be affected\n?    Total staff is approximately 75 - 85\n?    Per shift would be around 10 - 25\n\n10.    Product contamination:\n?    Direct exposure minimal\n?    Spoilage would occur if there was a loss of refrigeration\n\n11.    Property Damage\n?    Structural damage only if fire or explosion would occur\n?    Possibility of equipment damage\n\n12.    Operating History:\n?    Very minimal.  A few small leaks under 1 pound, during the start-up and commissioning phase\n?    None since acceptance in July 2001\n?    A few small leaks under 1 pound during pump downs and start up of the expansion\n\n13.    Consequences of deviation:\n?The temperature of space (Block Cooler, Cold storage, Shipping dock) or liquid (Glycol heat exchanger) would increase or decrease depending on how the system failed and what component failed.\n?    The evaporators are sized so that a loss of one of them in each space would not diminish the ability to cool.\n\n14.    Steps to correct the Deviation:\n?    The temperatures are monitored daily.  Alarms are in place so that any deviation from the set points would sound an audible alarm.  Based on which alarm is sounding will determine what course of action to take.\n\n15.    What tasks are performed here?\n?    The temperature is monitored daily, each evaporator is visually inspected daily.\n?    Daily rounds are completed and documented on the compressors and condensers.\n\n16.    Is the equipment accessible?\n?    A ladder would be required in the block cooler.\n?    A man lift would be required in the cold storage, shipping dock, and select valves in the engine room.\n?    All other valves and controls are within reach.\n\n17.    How difficult is it to understand and adjust the controls?\n?    It takes minimal training to operate this equipment; the controls are very straightforward.\n?    Each operator has his/her own password to access the ?Frick? computer.\n\n18.    Are labels easy and clear to understand?\n?    All valves (manual, or electrically operated) have tags on them.\n?    All piping is labeled to content and direction of flow.\n\n19.    What are the safety warning systems?\n?    The temperatures that are monitored will give us an indication of equipment malfunction.\n?    The smell of ammonia will give an indication of a leak, there are also ammonia detectors throughout the plant that will alarm if the level reaches 25PPM in the cold storage, block cooler, and shipping dock.  A 50PPM will set off an alarm in the engine room.\n\n20.    Can the inventory of refrigerant be reduced or substituted to make this system safer?\n?    No.  The inventory is at a minimal level to make the system function.\n?    A changeover to a substitute refrigerant is not feasible.  All Equipment and piping sizes would have to be changed.  All refrigerant has its own characteristics and hazards.\n\n21.    Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?\n?    The automatic controls work very well, this system would be hard to operate manually, and there is always a risk of human error.\n\n22.    Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?\n?    No.  Each unit is separate; there are valves in place to isolate each area from the system.\n\n23.    Where are the nearest oil drains?\n?    Oil pot located under the LPR\n?    Under each glycol chiller\n\n24.    Where is the nearest water?\n?    There are sinks in the Salter room, Shop, Shipping dock restroom.\n?    There are eye wash stations in the engine room and dry storage area.\n\n25.    How would ventilation be performed?\n?    There are two man doors in the block cooler.\n?    There are two exterior man doors in cold storage.\n?    There are two exterior shipping doors in the shipping dock area.\n?    There are two roof exhaust fans in the engine room that can be turned on manually or will start automatically on temperature and ammonia level alarms.\n\n26.

              "Description": "System:  Condensing Towers\n1.    Description of the process:  Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the low pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) different circuits.  Circuit #1 goes to #1 block cooler, #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.\nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  LIQUID AMMONIA BOILS AT ?28 DEGREES F AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of Ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure low temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the ?Frick Computer?.  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.   A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high Temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bleed valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n\nMAJOR COMPONENT FUNCTIONS\n?    Condensing Towers:  The condensing tower is located on the roof over the engine room.  The condenser serves two purposes; the first is to condense the high pressure, high temperature vapor to a high-pressure low temperature liquid.  The heat of vaporization is removed.  The second purpose is to eliminate any non-condensibles in the ammonia using an auto purger located inside the compressor room.\nThe set points of the condenser are entered on the ?Frick Computer? located in the maintenance shop, there are three fans located on the tower that help cool the vapor.  Water is supplied by two (2) water pumps located I the engine room, the indoor water sump is also located in the engine room.\n\n2.    Equipment List\ni.    #1 Condenser\n1.    Imeco Tower model XLPXL845\na.    One (1) 20 HP motor (one motor controls two fans)\nb.    One (1) 10 HP fan\nc.    Two (2) 20 HP water pumps\nii.    #2 Condenser\n1.    Imeco Tower model XLPXL940\na.    One (1) 30 HP motor (one motor controls two fans)\nb.    One (1) 15 HP fan\nc.    One (1) 20 HP water pump\n\n3.    Quantities\n?    The refrigeration system currently holds 13000 pounds of ammonia.\n?    The starter room receiver at any time could have as much as 2000 pounds.\n?    A catastrophic loss would result in the release of approximately 15000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n4.    Head pressure:\n?    100-150 PSIG at the compressors\n?    Condensing pressure 125 PSIG\n\n5.    Suction pressure:\n?    27-42 PSIG\n\n6.    Liquid pump discharge pressure;\n?    68 PSIG normal operating\n\n7.    Desired process temperature:\n?    #1 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    #2 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    Shipping dock 33-35 F\n?    #1 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #2 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #1 Cold storage 43-45 F\n?    #2 Cold storage 43-45 F\n\n8.    Age of system:\n?    Operational July 2001\n?    Expansion May 2006\n\n9.    Number of employees that could be affected\n?    Total staff is approximately 75 - 85\n?    Per shift would be around 10 - 25\n\n10.    Product contamination:\n?    Direct exposure minimal\n?    Spoilage would occur if there was a loss of refrigeration\n\n11.    Property Damage\n?    Structural damage only if fire or explosion would occur\n?    Possibility of equipment damage\n\n12    Operating History:\n?    Very minimal.  A few small leaks under 1 pound, during the start-up and commissioning phase\n?    None since acceptance in July 2001\n?    A few small leaks under 1 pound during the pump downs and start up of the expansion\n\n13.    Consequences of deviation:\n?    The temperature of space (Block Cooler, Cold storage, Shipping dock) or liquid (Glycol heat exchanger) would increase or decrease depending on how the system failed and what component failed.\n?    The evaporators are sized to that a loss of one of them in each space would not diminish the ability to cool.\n\n14.    Steps to correct the Deviation:\n?    The temperatures are monitored daily.  Alarms are in place so that any deviation from the set points would sound an audible alarm.  Based on which alarm is sounding will determine what course of action to take.\n\n15    What tasks are performed here?\n?    The temperature is monitored daily, each evaporator is visually inspected daily.\n?    Daily rounds are completed and documented on the compressors and condensers.\n\n16.    Is the equipment accessible?\n?    A ladder would be required in the block cooler.\n?    A man lift would be required in the cold storage, shipping dock, and select valves in the engine room.\n?    All other valves and controls are within reach.\n\n17.    How difficult is it to understand and adjust the controls?\n?    It takes minimal training to operate this equipment; the controls are very straightforward.\n?    Each operator has his/her own password to access the ?Frick? computer.\n\n18.    Are labels easy and clear to understand?\n?    All valves (manual, or electrically operated) have tags on them.\n?    All piping is labeled to content and direction of flow.\n\n19.    What are the safety warning systems?\n?    The temperatures that are monitored will give us an indication of equipment malfunction.\n?    The smell of ammonia will give an indication of a leak, there are also ammonia detectors throughout the plant that will alarm if the level reaches 25PPM in the cold storage, block cooler, and shipping dock.  A 50PPM will set off an alarm in the engine room.\n\n20.    Can the inventory of refrigerant be reduced or substituted to make this system safer?\n?    No.  The inventory is at a minimal level to make the system function.\n?    A changeover to a substitute refrigerant is not feasible.  All Equipment and piping sizes would have to be changed.  All refrigerant has its own characteristics and hazards.\n\n21.    Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?\n?    The automatic controls work very well, this system would be hard to operate manually, and there is always a risk of human error.\n\n22.    Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?\n?    No.  Each unit is separate; there are valves in place to isolate each area from the system.\n\n23.    Where are the nearest oil drains?\n?    Oil pot located under the LPR\n?    Under each glycol chiller\n\n24.    Where is the nearest water?\n?    There are sinks in the Salter room, Shop, Shipping dock restroom.\n?

              "Description": "System:  High Pressure Receiver\n1.    Description of the process:  Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the low pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) different circuits.  Circuit #1 goes to #1 block cooler, #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.\nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  LIQUID AMMONIA BOILS AT ?28 DEGREES F AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of Ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure low temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the ?Frick Computer?.  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.   A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high Temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bleed valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n\nMAJOR COMPONENT FUNCTIONS\n?    Ammonia Compressors:  There are five compressors all located in the engine room.  One (1) Frick model RXF85; two (2) Frick model RXF68; One (1) Frick model RXF101; and one (1) Frick model RWFII 134.  The compressors control the pressure on the suction side of the system; this function is to control the boiling point of ammonia in all of the system.  The current set point of the suction pressure is 34 PSIG.  The discharge vapor is sent to the condenser where the vapor is cooled to its condensing point, the condenser set point is 125 PSIG.  This controls the high pressures from the compressors.  All of the set points can be changed either from the ?Frick Computer? or the microprocessors located on each compressor.\n\n?    Condensing Tower:  The condensing tower is located on the roof over the engine room.  The condenser serves two purposes; the first is to condense the high pressure, high temperature vapor to a high-pressure low temperature liquid.  The heat of vaporization is removed.  The second purpose is to eliminate any noncondensibles in the ammonia using an auto purger located inside the compressor room.\nThe set points of the condenser are entered on the ?Frick Computer? located in the maintenance shop, there are three fans located on the tower that help cool the vapor.  Water is supplied by three (3) water pumps located in the engine room, the indoor water sump is also located in the engine room.\n\n?    High-pressure receiver (King Tank):  The king tank is located in the engine room.  Its purpose is to hold the ammonia in reserve until it is needed in the glycol surge drum or the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The ammonia is classified as high-pressure low temperature.  There are no pumps or fans associated with the king tank.  Capacity is 20,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n?    Glycol chiller surge drum:  The glycol surge drum is located in the engine room; its purpose is to supply liquid ammonia to the glycol plate and frame heat exchanger.  There are no pumps or fans associated with this chiller on the ammonia side.  A Hanson level control probe controls the level of ammonia in the drum.\n\n?    Low-pressure receiver (LPR):  Located in the engine room, this receiver is also called the suction accumulator.  Its purpose is two fold; it is a receiver for low-pressure low temperature liquid ammonia and an accumulator for ammonia gas (vapor).  The liquid ammonia comes from the king tank.  The level is controlled by a Hanson level control.  The ammonia vapors come from the liquid ammonia that has been pumped out to the evaporators in cold storage, shipping dock or the block cooler.  As the ammonia absorbs heat it boils and returns to the LPR through the suction piping.\n\n?    Block Cooler (cheese chilling tunnel):  The liquid ammonia goes through a pilot operated stop valve before entering a manifold, which connects four (4), coils.  An Intech SR46 controller monitors the preset temperature of the air entering the coils.  As the air temperature increases or decreases the controller will open or close the liquid stop valve.  The set points are entered from a touch panel located at the processor control panel.  There are four (4) fans associated with the block cooler.\n\n\n?    Cold storage, Shipping dock:  There are three (3) evaporators located in #1 cold storage, suspended from the ceiling.  There are three (3) additional evaporators located on the shipping dock also suspended from the ceiling and four (4) evaporators in #2 cold storage.  All ten (10) evaporators are an overfeed style, meaning that more liquid ammonia is pumped through them than what is allowed to boil.  The liquid vapor mixture is returned to the low-pressure receiver (LPR) to begin the cycle again.  The temperature probes located on the air inlet side monitor the set points; this probe is connected to the processor located in the engine room.  As any of the evaporators raise or lower in temperature a solenoid operated liquid valve opens or closes.  The evaporators in cold storage are set to defrost once (1 time) per week, the evaporators in the shipping dock are defrosted twice (2 times) daily.\n\n2.    Equipment List\n?    Engine Room:\ni.

              "Description": "System:  Low Pressure Receiver\n1.    Description of the process:  Liquid Ammonia is pumped from the low pressure receiver to cold storage where it is split into four (4) different circuits.  Circuit #1 goes to #1 block cooler, #2 cold storage.  Circuit #2 goes to #1 cold storage.  Circuit #3 goes to #2 block cooler.  Circuit #4 goes to the shipping dock.\nAs the liquid ammonia enters the evaporators (regardless of which one) some of the ammonia boils off.  LIQUID AMMONIA BOILS AT ?28 DEGREES F AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.  The liquid and vapor mixture exits the evaporators and is drawn back to the low-pressure receiver (LPR).  The liquid settles at the bottom of the receiver where it is then pumped back to the evaporators in the circuits.\nThe vapor is drawn into the suction of Ammonia compressors, after compression in any of the five compressors the vapor exits as a high-pressure high temperature vapor.  This vapor is directed to the condensing tower where it will travel inside of tubes cooled by water and airflow.  The vapor is cooled to its condensing point and returns to a liquid which is called high pressure low temperature liquid.  At this point the liquid returns to the high-pressure receiver (HPR) also called the king tank.  Here the liquid ammonia is stored until it is needed in the low-pressure receiver (LPR) or is needed in the glycol chilling system.\nAnother process of this system is the evaporator defrost called hot gas defrost.  The piping arrangement is between the discharge-piping manifold of the compressors and the condensing tower.  A regulator controls the amount of pressure that will go to each evaporator.  The entire process is automated and controlled by the ?Frick Computer?.  When the evaporator is entering a defrost mode the liquid ammonia valve will close allowing any ammonia in the evaporator to boil and leave the coils.  After a time the hot gas valve will open allowing high-pressure high temperature vapor into the evaporator.   A backpressure regulator controls the vapor pressure in the coil while excess pressure is released into the suction line.\nThis high Temperature gas warms the coils melting any ice that may have built up on the surfaces of the coils and fins.  At the end of the cycle the bleed valve will open and the hot gas valve will close relieving any pressure left in the evaporator.  After a time delay the liquid valve opens and the fans start to begin the next cooling cycle.\n\nMAJOR COMPONENT FUNCTIONS\n?    Low-pressure receiver (LPR):  Located in the engine room, this receiver is also called the suction accumulator.  Its purpose is two fold; it is a receiver for low-pressure low temperature liquid ammonia and an accumulator for ammonia gas (vapor).  The liquid ammonia comes from the king tank.  The level is controlled by a Hanson level control.  The ammonia vapors come from the liquid ammonia that has been pumped out to the evaporators in cold storage, shipping dock or the block cooler.  As the ammonia absorbs heat it boils and returns to the LPR through the suction piping.\n\n2.    Equipment List\ni.    Tanks\n1.    Low pressure receiver\na.    Morfab Equipment\nb.    Capacity 2000 gallon\n\n3.    Quantities\n?    The refrigeration system currently holds 13000 pounds of ammonia.\n?    The starter room receiver at any time could have as much as 2000 pounds.\n?    A catastrophic loss would result in the release of approximately 15000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n4.    Head pressure:\n?    100-150 PSIG at the compressors\n?    Condensing pressure 125 PSIG\n\n5.    Suction pressure:\n?    27-42 PSIG\n\n6.    Liquid pump discharge pressure;\n?    68 PSIG normal operating\n\n7.    Desired process temperature:\n?    #1 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    #2 Block cooler 43-45 F\n?    Shipping dock 33-35 F\n?    #1 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #2 Glycol Chiller 33 F\n?    #1 Cold storage 43-45 F\n?    #2 Cold storage 43-45 F\n\n8.    Age of system:\n?    Operational July 2001\n?    Expansion May 2006\n\n9.    Number of employees that could be affected\n?    Total staff is approximately 75 - 85\n?    Per shift would be around 10 ? 25\n\n10.    Product contamination:\n?    Direct exposure minimal\n?    Spoilage would occur if there was a loss of refrigeration\n\n11.    Property Damage\n?    Structural damage only if fire or explosion would occur\n?    Possibility of equipment damage\n\n12.    Operating History:\n?    Very minimal.  A few small leaks under 1 pound, during the start-up and commissioning phase\n?    None since acceptance in July 2001\n?    A few small leaks under 1 pound during the pump downs and start up of the expansion\n\n13.    Consequences of deviation:\n?    The temperature of space (Block Cooler, Cold storage, Shipping dock) or liquid (Glycol heat exchanger) Would increase or decrease depending on how the system failed and what component failed.\n?    The evaporators are sized to that a loss of one of them in each space would not Diminish the ability to cool.\n\n14.    Steps to correct the Deviation:\n?    The temperatures are monitored daily.  Alarms are in place so that any deviation     from the set points would sound an audible alarm.  Based on which alarm is sounding will determine what course of action to take.\n\n15.    What tasks are performed here?\n?    The temperature is monitored daily, each evaporator is visually inspected daily.\n?    Daily rounds are completed and documented on the compressors and condensers.\n\n16.    Is the equipment accessible?\n?    A ladder would be required in the block cooler.\n?    A man lift would be required in the cold storage, shipping dock, and select valves     in the engine room.\n?    All other valves and controls are within reach.\n\n17.    How difficult is it to understand and adjust the controls?\n?    It takes minimal training to operate this equipment; the controls are very straightforward.\n?    Each operator has his/her own password to access the ?Frick? computer.\n\n18.    Are labels easy and clear to understand?\n?    All valves (manual, or electrically operated) have tags on them.\n?    All piping is labeled to content and direction of flow.\n\n19.    What are the safety warning systems?\n?    The temperatures that are monitored will give us an indication of equipment     malfunction.\n?    The smell of ammonia will give an indication of a leak, there are also ammonia detectors throughout the plant that will alarm if the level reaches 25PPM in the cold storage, block cooler, and shipping dock.  A 50PPM will set off an alarm in the engine room.\n\n20.    Can the inventory of refrigerant be reduced or substituted to make this system safer?\n?    No.  The inventory is at a minimal level to make the system function.\n?    A changeover to a substitute refrigerant is not feasible.  All Equipment and piping sizes would have to be changed.  All refrigerant has its own characteristics and hazards.\n\n21.    Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?\n?    The automatic controls work very well, this system would be hard to operate     manually, and there is always a risk of human error.\n\n22.    Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?\n?    No.  Each unit is separate; there are valves in place to isolate each area from the system.\n\n23.    Where are the nearest oil drains?\n?    Oil pot located under the LPR\n?    Under each glycol chiller\n\n24.    Where is the nearest water?\n?    There are sinks in the Salter room, shop, and shipping dock restroom    \n?    There are eye wash stations in the engine room and dry storage area.\n\n25.    How would ventilation be performed\n?    There are two man doors in the block cooler.\n?    There are two exterior man doors in cold storage.\n?    There are two exterior shipping doors in the shipping dock area.\n?    There are two roof exhaust fans in the engine room that can be turned on manually or will start automatically on temperature and ammonia level alarms.\n\n26.    Where are the relief lines and valves?\n?    King tank, LPR, Glycol Chiller, Frick Compressors (5),\n?    All of the relief valves are plumbed outside on the roof near the condenser.\n\n27.    The location of breakers and isolation valves:\n?    Low pressure receiver (suction accumulator)\n?    Ammonia pump #1 (West) MCC10 Bucket #34\n?    Discharge valve ML016\n?    Hand expansion ML017\n?    Vent ML018\n?    Suction \n?    Ammonia pump #2 (East) MCC10 bucket #37\n?    Discharge valve ML031\n?    Hand expansion ML030\n?    Vent ML021\n?    Suction \n?

      "SummaryText": "Purpose:  The safety and health of our employees, along with our responsibility to our consumers, makes it paramount that we take every measure to eliminate as far as possible the consequences of a catastrophic ammonia release or spill.  Therefore Columbia River Processing has established the Risk Management Plan to set policy and give direction to managers, operators, and employees at this facility.\n\nScope and Application:  This Plan applies to all ammonia refrigeration units, lines, tanks, and compressors throughout this facility.\n\nEmployee Participation:  The Risk Management Plan is the responsibility of everyone at Columbia River Processing.  Consequently, managers and employees are jointly responsible to ensure the effectiveness of the plan.  Maintenance staff and the appointed RMP Manager will consult with affected employees on a regular basis regarding conduct and development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's) and in the development of any program element.\n\nColumbia River Processing Risk Management Plan:\n\nProduction of superior dairy products requires the use of some chemicals that could pose a risk to both employees and the public if handled improperly, spilled, or released.  Columbia River Processing recognizes the duty to protect the safety and health of employees, the community, and our customers.  Therefore Columbia River Processing has developed and implemented a Risk Management Plan for anhydrous ammonia.  The purpose of this plan is to keep safe operation a company priority through establishing policy, identifying risks, documenting maintenance, and tracking compliance with established standards.\n\nThis plan is a living collaborative effort developed by employees, maintenance staff, and management.  The Plant Manager and the Engineering Manager are the plan managers and will consult with employees on a regular basis regarding conduct and development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's) and plan modification.\n\nColumbia River Processing produces natural ch"

      "SummaryText": "eddar cheeses, which are stored for a time period, which requires precise temperature control and extensive refrigeration.  As is common in the industry, this facility uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in all cheese storage areas.  Approximately 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is contained in the refrigeration system.  Another 2,000 pounds is used in the cheese making process.  It is the intent of the Risk Management Plan to identify and prepare for a worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan applies to all ammonia refrigeration units, lines, tanks, and compressors located throughout the facility\n\nThe worse-case scenario identified is the Risk Management Plan is the catastrophic loss of 15,000 pounds of ammonia within 10 minutes.  Such a release will have off-sight consequences that will require notification, and potential evacuation of nearby facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas or liquid with a readily detectable odor at 0.7 ppm.  Ammonia gas is a severe irritant to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.  Exposure to concentrations of 2,500 to 6,500 ppm, which could occur in a worst-case scenario, can cause corneal irritation, shortness of breath, bronchospasms, chest pains, and pulmonary edema, which may be fatal.  Contained in the plan are procedures to mitigate the off-sight consequences and procedures to implement resident notification.\n\nAn alternate more likely scenario identified in the Risk Managemen Plan is the release of 1 to 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  A release of this size still presents a risk to employees.  However, such a release does not have the off-sight consequences identified in the worst-case scenario, and will not require notification or evacuation of nearby residences or facilities.  Maintenance policy and training have been developed to facilitate immediate resolution of any ammonia leak, before it can develop into a worst-case scenario.  Within the plan are procedures to evacuate employees while r"

      "SummaryText": "epairing the leak.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan also outlines a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program.  This program identifies each component of the ammonia refrigeration system and evaluates the potential ammonia release risk.  An important item of the PHA program is a \"what if analysis\" of each component.  The intent of the \"what if analysis\" is to identify ways in which ammonia could be released, and develop a response to minimize the magnitude of the release.\n\nDevelopment of a Risk Management Plan is a proactive effort by Columbia River Processing to protect both the employee and the community from future releases of ammonia.  While small releases of ammonia do occur, there has not been a release of a reportable amount of ammonia in this facility.\n\nAnother important aspect of the Risk Management Plan is the Emergency Response Program.  This program is a written action plan outlining the response to any release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Key issues outlined in this plan include escape routes, decontamination procedures, medical duties, post evacuation procedures, and reporting requirements.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan developed by Columbia River Processing is a dynamic document.  This plan is updated annually, or whenever any component of the ammonia system changes.  This facility is commited to reducing the likelihood of an ammonia release.  To improve process safety and protect employees, improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system will be identified and implemented.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nColumbia River Processing currently uses ammonia as its main refrigerant.  In the event of a major ammonia catastrophe all ammonia could be lost.  Approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released into the plant and surrounding areas.\n\nDependant upon the time of the year, the wind could blow the ammonia in one of several directions: North, South, East or West.  The wind speed could range from 5 mph to 60 mph, again dependant upon the time of th"

Most often, the leak will quickly be isolated and taken care of by a trained member of the maintenance staff.  However, if the leak occurs within a highly populated working area, employees in that area would be evacuated.\n\nIf the ammonia leak occurs within a work area of low population, the leak would be isolated and vented into the atmosphere.  Employees would not have to be evacuated from their stations and production could continue as normal.\n\nMaintenance mechanics are continuously on sight and would be notified of the leak immediately, thus greatly reducing the chances of a minor incident turning into a major incident."
