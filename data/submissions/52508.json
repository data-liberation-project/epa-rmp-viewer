Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAtlas Copco Mafi-Trench Company LLC of Costa Mesa, California is committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures.  The facility handles liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, also known as propane) and liquefied natural gas (LNG, also known as methane.)  It is the policy of the company to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. Only trained personnel work with regulated materials. These personnel are trained to follow safe handling procedures at all times. Regular maintenance and auditing of the system occurs in order to prevent problems.\n\nOther regulations that cover the materials handled include, but are not limited to, OSHA PSM and hazardous material storage regulations.  Those regulations also include accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions.  As discussed below, the facility will respond to minor incidents onsite, but will rely on outside responders in the case of any offsite release situations.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAtlas Copco Mafi-Trench Company LLC manufactures, assembles, and tests submerged cryogenic pumps.  Tests are conducted in an area known as the test stand, using the LPG or LNG as well as nitrogen.  The cryogenic test stand is the main area of the facility addressed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and supporting documentation.\n\nAccess to the property is controlled restricted to authorized employees, management, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe LPG and LNG are held in quantities that meet the criteria for mandatory RMP preparation.  LPG is stored in one tank holding approximately 31,000 pounds.  LNG is stored in two tanks of approximately 41,000 lb each.\n\n\n\n3.     General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAll prevention program elements apply to both LNG and LPG.  The company complies with the most stringent prevention program level unde"

The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with general safety standards, such as NFPA, Compressed Gas Association safe handling practices, Uniform Fire Code and other generally accepted practices.  The system is designed with safety backups throughout, such as backup valves in case one fails.  Many other safety regulations have also been implemented, including OSHA PSM and hazardous material inventory and business plan reporting.\n\nFire prevention is accomplished by controlling access and posting for \"no smoking.\"  In addition, the facility has hot work procedures, a water sprinkler deluge system, and UV detection all designed to prevent fires from affecting the storage tanks.  There are also hydrocarbon detectors in the test area to detect releases of LNG or LPG around the tanks, the test stand and the flare.\n\n \n\n4.     Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years that resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nAtlas Copco Mafi-Trench Company LLC has documented Emergency Response procedures compliant with OSHA PSM and locally implemented hazardous material storage regulations. The facility can and will respond to minor incidents within the capabilities of trained maintenance and operations staff, such as isolating and bypassing  a valve with a pin-hole leak.  However, the facility will notify and rely on outside public responders in the event of an offsite release, or any incident that has the potential to cause an offsite release. Public responders will be relied on to inform the public, provide emergency health care, and manage on and offsite mitigation.\n\nThe site staff is trained on emergency notification of public agencies.  The Costa Mesa Fire Department is aware of the hazardous materials onsite and has conducted joint onsite training and regular inspections.  There is a security"

Programs are reviewed and updated routinely, and physical changes are made if recommended by technical experts\n\n"
