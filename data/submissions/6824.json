The Process Safety Code of Responsible Care is designed to prevent fires, explosions and accidental chemical releases.  The code requires safety audits, inspection and maintenance programs and safety training for employees and contract workers.\n\nThe El Segundo site is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon producing facility that has approximately 60 employees.  The products that the facility produces are used as foam blowing agents and solvents.  The facility's process involves reacting 1,1,1-trichloroethane with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF). Chlorine is also used as a process chemical. HF and chlorine are on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  At the El Segundo site, HF and chlorine are present in quantities exceeding the RMP regulation's threshold quantities.\n\nThe El Segundo site has devoted considerable amounts of manpower and capital to bring its computer systems to Year 2000 compliance.  As an additional assurance of safe operation, the process will be shutdown on December 31, 1999 and re-started on January 1, 2000.  All employees critical to the operation will be on-site during the shutdown and startup of the process.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following seven elements is provided for the El Segundo site.\n\n1) Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIt is the policy of the El Segundo site to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety and environmental risks related to its operation.  We accomplish this goal by designing the processes to protect people, property and the environment by:\n \n( Professional engineering and design\n( Hazard assessments of critical processes (HAZOP)\n( Employee tra"

This includes the use of safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training and testing of the site emergency response plan, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Emergency Response Team. Our efforts and resources are coordinated with local emergency response agencies. We have an ongoing effort to communicate these programs with the community.\n\n\n2) Stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nThe El Segundo site uses HF as a raw material in the production of dichlorofluoroethane, chlorodifluoroethane, and hydrochloric acid.  HF is stored and handled in quantities above the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  The Site's stationary source of HF consists of one bulk storage tank and process distribution equipment located within the south side of the process area.  HF is delivered to the site via tankcar.  The tankcar's contents are unloaded by the site's specially trained serviceman into a refrigerated, above the ground, horizontal bulk storage tank identified as V-123.    HF is pumped from the storage tank to reactors. \n\nThe El Segundo site uses chlorine as a process chemical in the production of dichlorofluoroethane and chlorodifluoroethane.  It is stored and handled in quantities above the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule. Chlorine is purchased from an outside vendor and delivered to"

EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the El Segundo site is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\nModeling Procedures and Assumptions for Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the \"worst-case release scenario\" at the El Segundo site was performed for a 20,000 gallon liquid HF tankcar at ambient conditions. Utilizing EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the worse-case scenario releases of the contents of the tankcar showed that a hypothetical release from the tankcar would have an impact beyond the boundaries of the plant site.  The assumptions used for the worst-case scenario for the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride from the tankcar were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic liquids.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP Rule, the maximum capacity of the tankcar was assumed to be released as a gas.  The assumptions followed in the modeling analysis were:\n\n( Stability Class \"F\", 1.5 meters per second wind speed, an ambient temperature of 77 F and 50% relative humidity; \n( El Segundo was assumed to have an \"urban\" dispersion environment;\n( Followin"

This endpoint concentration was selected by EPA and listed in the RMP Rule specifically for anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.\n \nModeling Procedures and Assumptions for Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe HGSYSTEM dispersion model was used to calculate the distances to toxic endpoint for HF.  The evaporation rate for the spill in the Alternate Scenario was calculated by the use of the PAVE pool evaporation model. Other assumptions used in the modeling of \"Alternate\" releases are given below:\n\nNeutral atmospheric stability (Class \"D\");\nWind speed of 3 meters per second at 10-meter height above ground;\nAn ambient temperature of 77 F;\nRelative humidity at 50%;\nSurface roughness of 1 meter based upon EPA Guidance for \"urban\" dispersion\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)\n\nUnder the alternative release scenario required by the RMP Rule, HF would be hypothetically released at a pressure of 25 psig and a temperature of 60 F through a flange leak that develops in a liquid outlet nozzle of the HF storage tank. The effective diameter of the flange leak is 0.25 inches. Since the HF liquid is below its boiling point, it is assumed that all the liquid reaches the ground in the form of an evaporating liquid pool. \n\nWithin seconds of the release, HF atmospheric sensors stationed around the plant would automatically alert AlliedSignal operating personnel, the El Segundo Fire Department, and the South Coast Air Quality Management District of the leak. Remote controlled shutoff valves on both ends of the HF piping would be closed, thereby minimizing the quantity of HF released to the environment.

The chlorine is released at a rate of 93.8 lb./min until the cylinder is empty.\n\nWithin seconds of the release, a chlorine atmospheric sensor adjacent to the chlorine cylinder would automatically alert AlliedSignal operating personnel.

The plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate AlliedSignal employees and response personnel, El Segundo Fire Department personnel, and other response agencies during the site's emergency response activities.  The site has provided the Emergency Action Plan to local governmental agencies and hospitals.  The site maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond, mitigate, and stop incidents involving accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and chlorine.  The ERT holds quarterly plant emergency response drills.  The Emergency Action Plan is continuously improved and revised.\n\n\n7) Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe process hazards analysis (PHA) is updated and validated at least every five years. These PHA's were most recently completed in September of 1997.  A team consisting of plant personnel and management conducted a detailed safety review of the operation.  As a result, action items were identified and implemented to improve on the existing safeguards to further reduce the potential of an accidental release.  \n\nFuture safety improvements will be identified and implemented through risk management program audits, monthly safety audit conducted by front line supervision and site management, and continuous safety system analysis and improvement suggestions by plant operators, maintenance personnel, engineering staff, and site leadership."
