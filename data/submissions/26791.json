The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the LaGrange Gas Processing Plant because the plant handles an stores methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n1.  \u00a7112(r) \u00bf Purpose and General Duty Clause \u00bf The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  ET is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the LaGrange Gas Processing Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure the safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  ET, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Fayette County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n2.  Risk Management Plan \u00bf The LaGrange Gas Processing Plant processes natural gas, recovering natural gas liquids an producing pipeline quality natural gas.  This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in \u00a7112(r), ET management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids.  Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency respons"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nFor planning purposes, ETC has considered the impact of a \u00bfworst case\u00bf accident, defined to be the destruction of the slug catcher resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which explodes.  Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u00bfs (NOAA\u00bfs) RMP*Comp methodology, a potential radius of impact due to the explosion was calculated to extend to 0.60 miles.  Demographic information based on the 1990 census indicates that 15 people live within the radius.  However, it should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the 0.6-mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nETC also considered the impact of a more likely release.  This alternative release is characterized as an accident during loading of liquids from a truck into one of the \u00bfbullet\u00bf storage tanks at the site.  If the truck driver failed to disconnect the transfer hose prior to departure, upstream piping and equipment could potentially be damaged, resulting in a release of a mixture of natural gas liquids under pressure.  The duration of this release could be up to ten minutes, based on the time needed to close valves.  Using RMP*Comp, the impact distance of a potential explosion of the vapor cloud formed after this release was calculated to be 0.28 miles.  No off-site receptors, such as residence, schools, churches, and parks are located within this radius.\n\nEnergy Transfer Company (ETC) has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  ETC has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures.  ETC provides annual emergency response"

Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
