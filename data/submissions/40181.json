The management and employees of the Lincoln facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Methylacetylene-Propadiene/Propylene/Propane Mixtures (MAPP). If an accidental release sould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Lincoln operation is a MAPP storage and distribution facility which is generally unmanned. When manned, the facility's primary operation is the distribution, unloading of MAPP from railcars (35,000 gal/ 144,700 lb.) into two 18,000 gal. (73,400 lb.) high pressure ASME storage tanks. The MAPP is then transfilled into DOT approved road tankers and distributed to customers.
