Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Flagler Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is required to provide disinfection to the treated wastewater effluent.  Following disinfection of the treated wastewater, the chlorine is removed from the water with sulfur dioxide prior to discharge.  Chlorine gas is used to achieve the level of disinfection required under state and federal regulations.  Chlorine is considered a toxic substance by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and because quantities above the 2,500 pound threshold limit are stored on-site, a Risk Management Program (RMP) is required.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to on-site personnel, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of The City of Flagler Beach to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, safe handling procedures of the operators, and the training of personnel.\n\nThe City of Flagler Beach WWTP's emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the City of Flagler Beach Fire Department and through a mutual aid agreement throughout Flagler County, the Palm Coast Fire Department Hazmat Team. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of City of Flagler Beach WWTP is to provide a treated, disinfected, wastewater effluent that meets all Federal, State and local requirements prior to discharge.  The chlorine is received via truck from P.B.&S. Chemical. Access to this facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and other authorized personnel.  Chlorine is the only substance at this faci"

The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Catastrophic failure of a 1-ton chlorine container due to corrosion, impact, or structural defects.  It is assumed that all 2,000 pounds of the chlorine is released as vapor, which is heavier than air, in 10-minutes at a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be 1.3 miles using to the EPA model RMP*Comp.  The affected area would include residential areas with a population of 944 persons and the Wadsworth County Park. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of chlorine gas through the 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening.  It is assumed that a 317 pound total release of chlorine gas occurs with a maximum average sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute for a 60 minute duration.  The distance to endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be 0.1 miles using the EPA model RMP*Comp.  The affected area would include a residential area with a population of two persons.\n\nPrior to acceptance of the 1-ton chlorine containers, each container is inspected for visual defects that may cause an accidental release.  The chlorination system operates under vacuum pressure and is inspected daily. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and is operated in accordance with federal and state codes and regulations.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any accidental releases of chlorine i"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility uses chlorination to disinfect the treated wastewater prior to discharge.  The changes that have occurred since the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) meeting held on May 5, 1999 include the development of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for daily and emergency chlorine handling. In addition, all WWTP personnel along with Flagler Beach Fire Department personnel received chlorine handling and safety training from P.B.&S. Chemical in May of 1999.\n"
