Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Inergy Midstream LLC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Bath Volunteer Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled                                                                                      \nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Storage of Liquefied Petroleum Gas.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane and Propane.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Butane that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements 130,000,000 lb. while Propane is expected to be present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 30,000,000 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n To evaluate the worst-case scenarios in our Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), we have used RMP Comp 32, as supplied from the EPA. For alternative release scenario analyses in our OCA, we have used RMP Comp 32 as supplied from the EPA. Administrative controls and mitigation measures, although not reported here, have been made available to our personnel and"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nInergy Midstream LLC. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is an in-house hazard analysis.  The studies are undertaken by  qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Inergy Midstream LLC. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nInergy Midstream LLC. has a comprehensive training program in place to e"
