      "SummaryText": "     At Blue Star Growers the hazards are from all of the engine rooms and the pipes that carry the ammonia.  These engine rooms control all of the CA rooms in all of the buildings.   The process in these engine rooms has a total capacity of over 10,000 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n     The place were most leaks or releases of ammonia will occur are in the engine rooms themselves.  However all of the connections, valves and gauges have a potential for leaks or ruptures.   Most leaks or ruptures will be small and easily fixed by one of Blue Star Growers qualified refrigeration employees.  The most common causes of releases are operations and maintenance failures, equipment failures, and process failures.  These are the three leading causes of accidental releases of ammonia.\n     When there is an  accidental release when no one is on the premise, this would be handled by the computer.  The computer checks all areas where ammonia could possibly be.  When the computer finds ammonia it turns on the alarm, dials emergency numbers for all refrigeration employees.  The employees in turn come down to the warehouse and fix the leak and shut of the alarm.\n     Because of this Blue Star Growers makes daily inspections of the process to determine if there are any potential problems.\n     The Worst Case Scenario at Blue Star Growers would be an ammonia gas release from the breaking or rupture of a 4\" (18 square inches) ammonia pipe that is located inside the engine room and is attached to the receiver.  This would be accomplished by earthquake, fire, or over pressure within the system.  If this did happen, it would completely drain the system of ammonia.  This type of a release would allow the gas to travel 4277 feet and would affect about 2550 people.\n     The Alternative Case Scenario at Blue Star Growers would be where a forklift driver was either getting fruit out of a room or putting fruit into a room.  There are refrigeration lines toward the front of each room.  If a forklif"

      "SummaryText": "t driver wasn't paying attention, he could hit one of the lines when stacking or unstacking the fruit.  When this happens, a line about four square inches in size could be broken.  This would allow ammonia gas to leak into the room.  This gas could escape the room, hallways and go outside.  This type of a release would allow the gas to travel 1003 feet and would affect about 155 people.\n     Blue Star Growers has been in business since the early 1950's and has had ammonia refrigeration all of that time with no release that affected any on or off-site area.\n     The check for an accidental release of ammonia is an on-going operation.  It is performed on a daily basis.  Each Blue Star Growers refrigeration employee is responsible for the examining of each piece of the process that is located in the engine rooms and the piping that takes the ammonia from the engine room to each CA or common storage room.  Inspections are made seven days a week and repairs to minor leaks are corrected as they are identified.\n     If there is an accidental release of ammonia from Blue Star Growers in the amount that would affect the public, the following will occur.\n     The refrigeration department has received the 32 hour training course by ASTI, and will be the emergency response team.  They will try to control the release and will be in-charge of any repairs to the system.   It will also be determined whether the plant should be evacuated.  The emergency response team will follow all prescribed rules within the emergency response plan."
