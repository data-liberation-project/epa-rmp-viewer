Our goal as a company is to comply with federal, state and local laws. The entire management team has the responsibility of providing our employees with an environment conducive to an atmosphere of safety.\n\nAmmonia safety is a priority within our facility. Our goal is to prevent problems, through the use of our preventive maintenance program that we enforce. The purpose is to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions and make necessary modifications before problems develop. Our on going program is designed to maintain the integrity of the system and assure that all employees are properly trained and meet the requirements to operate our equipment within the boundaries of our PSM/RMP program.\n\nThe Facilities Team Leader is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle Jonesboro Plant produces and packages frozen prepared foods. The facility uses ammonia in its refrigeration system as a heat transfer medium.  The maximum inventory at the plant is approximately 48,000 pounds. Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Jonesboro Plant.\n\nSummary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at the Jonesboro Plant involves the release of 30,755 pounds of ammonia to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period due to the failure of a high-pressure vessel. The amount released reflects written administrative procedures in place at the plant to limit the amount of ammonia stored in the vessel to 80% of its capacity.  Under worst case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site consequences. \n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario at the Jonesboro Plant involves the release of 15,156 pounds of am"

The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\u00b7 Employee Participation\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information\n\u00b7 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00b7 Operating Procedures\n\u00b7 Training Programs\n\u00b7 Contractor Program\n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity Program\n\u00b7 Hot Work Permit Procedure\n\u00b7 Management of Change Procedures\n\u00b7 Incident Investigation\n\u00b7 Compliance Audit Procedure\n\u00b7 Pre-Startup Safety Procedure\n \n \n Five Year Accident History \n \nNo ammonia-related incidents occurred at the Jonesboro Facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant off-site consequences.\n \n \n Description of the Emergency"
