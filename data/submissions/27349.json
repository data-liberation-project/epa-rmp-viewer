Our goal as a company is to comply with federal, state and local laws. The entire management team has the responsibility of providing our employees with an environment conducive to an atmosphere of safety.\n\nAmmonia safety is a priority within our facility. Our goal is to prevent problems, through the use of our preventive maintenance program that we enforce. The purpose is to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions and make necessary modifications before problems develop. Our on going program is designed to maintain the integrity of the system and assure that all employees are properly trained and meet the requirements to operate our equipment within the boundaries of our PSM/RMP program.\n\nThe Facilities Team Leader is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle Jonesboro Plant produces and packages frozen prepared foods. The facility uses ammonia in its refrigeration system as a heat transfer medium.  The maximum inventory at the plant is approximately 48,000 pounds. Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Jonesboro Plant.\n\nSummary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at the Jonesboro Plant involves the release of 30,755 pounds of ammonia to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period due to the failure of a high-pressure vessel. The amount released reflects written administrative procedures in place at the plant to limit the amount of ammonia stored in the vessel to 80% of its capacity.  Under worst case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site consequences. \n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario at the Jonesboro Plant involves the release of 15,156 pounds of am"

Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site consequences.\n\nThe worst case and alternative toxic release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\n? The weather conditions that were used for the worst-case release scenario do not occur, while those used for the alternative case are uncommon;\n? Industry standards are followed for the design and manufacture of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system;\n? The high-pressure ammonia vessel and the drain line are located in a diked area, well protected from vehicular traffic.\n? Pressure safety valves on the high-pressure vessel should limit any pressure increase inside the tank;\n? Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n? The facility has a preventative maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the ammonia equipment; \n? The facility has a training program designed to ensure qualified personnel operate the systems; \n? The facility has emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential release.\n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations. The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n? Employee Participation\n? Process Safety Information\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n? Operating Procedures\n? Training Programs\n? Contractor Program\n? Mechanical Integrity Program\n? Hot Work Permit Procedure\n? Management of Change Procedures\n? Incident Investigation\n? Compliance Audit Procedure\n? Pre-Startup Safety Procedure\n \n \n Five Year Accident History \n \nNo ammonia-related incidents occurred at the Jonesboro Facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant off-site consequences.\n \n \n Description of the Emergency"

This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies.\n \n \n The emergency response program includes the following elements:\n \n? Ammonia Leak Procedures \n? Emergency Evacuation Plan\n? Emergency Response Team Responsibilities\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nNumerous changes were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures prior to the system start-up in 2003.  The recommended changes will be evaluated and implemented as necessary."
