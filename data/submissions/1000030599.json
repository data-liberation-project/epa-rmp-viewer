This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.   It is company policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies. Safety is an essential part of facility operations as evidenced by the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source\n\nThe facility's primary activities include distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals including compressed gases for use in water and wastewater treatment.\n\n\n\n3. The Process Safety Management Program\n\nThe Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes"

The methodologies used to complete these analyses are the Hazop (Hazard and Operability Study), Checklists as well as a Hazop/Checklist (combined) approach.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years as required or as necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n \n\nTraining\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and p"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM/RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Reports are retained as defined by retention policy.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Facility employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n \n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The company has a stric"

Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of a regulated substance from this facility this period.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nOur emergency plan has been reviewed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In addition, local responders are invited to tour the facility and meet facility personnel on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n6.
