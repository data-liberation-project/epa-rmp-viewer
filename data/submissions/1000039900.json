The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases. Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders. The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning. Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\n\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\n\n\n\n    A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite "

The Cavin Plant is owned and operated by Owensboro Municipal Utilities with the NAICS Code Number 22131.  The Cavin Plant received the EPA Facility Identifier Number 100000132732.\n\n\n\nIn July 2003, the Elmer Smith Station (NAICS Code 221112) added anhydrous ammonia to the station in quantities greater than the RMP threshold quantity.  As such, the Elmer Smith Station is submitted RMP registration data. \n\n\n\nThe Cavin Plant and Elmer Smith Station are both owned and operated by Owensboro Municipal Utilities. In addition, the two plants are contiguous properties.  Based on definition of stationary source, the two plants will be covered under one RMP Plan registration.

Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, stored as a liquid under pressure.  The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid ammonia is released it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death.  Ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at concentrations above 50 ppm; concentration that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 300 ppm.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of ammonia so that the primary threat is to people who are unable to flee.\n\n\n\nThe Cavin Plant uses chlorine to treat water for eventual potable usage in quantities requiring an RMP (under present EPA regulation).  This process is for the chlorination of drinking water supplies.  Chlorine is a dense, nonflammable greenish-yellow gas with a bleach-like odor.  It is corrosive and severely irritating to all tissue.  The chlorine reduces bacterial and algal growth. The water treatment systems consist of a one ton chlorine container and associated piping, valves, and chlorine feed equipment that dissolves chlorine into the circulated water. \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with requirements for hazardous materials use, and it is Owensboro Municipal Utilities' (OMU) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is OMU's policy to notify the Daviess County LEPC and respond to the emergency.  A site spe"
