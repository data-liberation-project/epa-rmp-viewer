The regulated substance under the RMP\nrule is Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7). Anhydrous Ammonia is used exclusively as a  refrigerant for cooling purposes in both production and storage areas. There are two separate refrigeration systems on site, operating independent of one another. Both systems are a closed loop with normal operating  pressures of less than 200 PSI. The Main Plant system (process) has a maximum charge of 13,442 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The Hassia system (process) has a maximum charge of 18,881 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The remaining 1,400 lbs, are stored outdoors in ten 140 lb D.O.T. certified blue cylinders. These cylinders are in a locked steel mesh cage.\nQuantity:\n\nMaximum quantities on-site for the regulated substance are\nAmmonia (Anhydrous)-33,723 lbs.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Policies:\n\nConAgra Foods Retail Products Company of Menomonie WI.  has established an in-house level A emergency response \"HAZMAT\" team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 \"HAZWOPER\".  The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency.
