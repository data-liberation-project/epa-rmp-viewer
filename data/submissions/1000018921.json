The Distribution Center is\nadjacent to the APG Inc./KIK Custom Products Main and North Plants that house nine aerosol manufacturing\nlines and one liquid filling line, as well as compounding facilities and storage facilities for raw materials.\n\nThe Distribution Center occupies 210,000 square feet under roof. It has been designed and constructed in\naccordance with the current building codes and fire standards, and includes features such as a fire protection\nsprinkler system supported by a pump house, and fire detection and alarms systems that are constantly\nmonitored and maintained by a contracted security company.\n\nThe Distribution Center provides storage of incoming components and outgoing finished products for the Main\nand North Plants. The incoming components include metal cans, plastic valves and caps, and corrugated\nboxes. The outgoing finished products are consumer commodities for various sectors including personal care,\nhousehold, food and pharmaceutical. The finished products include air fresheners, hair mousses and sprays,\nbody sprays, cooking sprays, cleaning products, liquid soaps, shaving creams, and foot sprays. Many of these\nproducts are aerosols and contain flammable propellants.

The Distribution Center has also been included in the Process Safety Management\nprogram developed and implemented at the adjacent APG Inc./KIK Custom Products North and Main Plants.\nThe PSM program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday\noperations and maintenance of the Distribution Center.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere has been one incident in the last five years that occurred on 11/15/2006.\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nThe Distribution Center has been included in the \"Integrated Contingency Plan\" and that also\naddresses the adjacent Main and North Plants.
