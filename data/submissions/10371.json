These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  Some examples are the implementation of recommendations from our hazard reviews and incident investigations.  Other examples are the improvement steps that result from review of our operating and mechanical procedures systems that are tightly integrated with our training programs. A key improvement step underway involves entry into the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  This is a joint effort with our unions that will strengthen our overall prevention programs.

Our communications goal is to go beyond the requirements defined in the RMP rule.  From the outset, our plan has been to communicate RMP elements to as broad a local audience as we can reach.  The RMP rule also is enabling us to educate and inform the Baytown community about safety measures in place and the close working relationship we have between Exxon emergency responders, the City of Baytown Fire and Police Departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant committed to participating with over 120 other member companies of the East Harris County Manufacturers Association (EHCMA) to communicate RMP broadly and openly.  Through several EHCMA RMP work groups, industry and citizen volunteers worked to develop a communication plan which would 1) include a large regional event with opportunities for expression of diverse viewpoints on chemical risk management and a forum for each member company to provide its offsite consequences materials to the media and the public; and 2) provide industry in each of several local communities along the Houston Ship Channel--the Baytown area being one--an opportunity to communicate RMP throughout their community.\n\nEHCMA's RMP community hall meeting was held on February 4, 1999, at the Pasadena (Texas) Convention Center and attended by over 800 people.  Reporters from at least 11 radio and TV stations, seven local area newspapers, the Houston Chronicle and several chemical industry publications were present and reported extensively about the event.\n\nIn Baytown, the Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant worked jointly with other local area chemical plants, citizen volunteers, our Baytown area"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training, and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1991 to adopt structured environmental and safety management systems, entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.  It operates to produce a variety of petrochemical products such as Butyl Rubber, polypropylene plastic, and a number of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as propylene.  The plant has several regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and isobutylene.  In addition, the plant uses anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, bromine, and methyl chloride that are regulated substances under RMP.  The plant includes a tota"

These tables cover all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at our plant is a release of bromine from a storage tank that would have an off-site endpoint.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should an incident occur, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a covered flammable, in our case isobutylene (2-methylpropene).  The full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should an incident occur, no credit for mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. This WCS has an off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for Anhydrous Ammonia is a failure of a loading hose during transfer operations. This ARS has an off-site endpoint. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for bromine is a leak in a loading hose during unloading operations.  This scenario would have an off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine involves a piping failure on a shipping cylinder. This scenario has an off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for methyl chloride involves the failure of a piping flange gasket.

This is the same approach taken with respect to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  We believe that this approach provides the maximum safety for our employees and the community.  \n\n In addition, Exxon Corporation has implemented its Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  OIMS includes aspects of EPA's prevention program.  As already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMPlan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To accommodate the ever-changing nature of the database, we selected April 1, 1999, as the date to collect this information.  Most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the chemical plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by Exxon Research and Engineering and Exxon Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are appropriate.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated. Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that process controls do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Exxon Baytown Chemical Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Baytown Chemical Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.
