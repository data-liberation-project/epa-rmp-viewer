In our processes, we use the following toxic chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our facility to cool our warehouse, shipping areas and freezers.  Approximately 18,000 pounds of ammonia are on-site in the refrigeration process, including: high pressure receiver vessels, compressors, recirculators, associated piping, pumps, heat exchangers, and evaporators.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia falls under Program 3 requirements.  Failure of our largest ammonia vessel would be the worst case scenario for our facility.  That recirculator vessel is inside our building.  In a worst case scenario, approximately 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released in 10 minutes.  Using EPA offsite consequence analysis (OCA) lookup tables, such a release could reach receptors 1.4 miles (7,400 feet) from the plant before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm ammonia) to the public.  Based on the 1990 U.S. Census and LandView III mapping software, approximately 5,138 people live within 1.4"

      "SummaryText": "miles of our facility.  Within that distance are residences, businesses, schools and churches.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario for our facility is based on a more likely event than the worst case scenario.  We have assumed an outdoor relief valve (for example, near an evaporative condenser) opens (lifts) and the release goes undetected for 10 minutes before employees manually isolate the problem.  The potential release of 600 pounds of ammonia gas results in a distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm) at 0.19 miles (1,000 feet).  This distance is determined using the EPA OCA lookup method.  There were approximately 142 people living within that distance of our facility according to he 1990 U.S. Census for Spartanburg County and using LandView III mapping software.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention step:\n\n1.  Scheduled preventive maintenance for ammonia refrigeration equipment.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we"
