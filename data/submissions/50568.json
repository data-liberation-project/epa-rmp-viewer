Components of the HF systems are covered under a Mechanical Integrity program to assure that they operate safely and are physically sound.  Appropriate standard operating procedures (work instructions) are in place for start-up and shutdown of the processes, in both normal and emergency situations.  Information on the chemical, process technology, and equipment has been compiled. Changes to the process are reviewed under management of change procedures.  Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to the implementation of any process change.  Contractors receive extensive safety training prior to beginning work in the facility.  Competence of the contractor employees is assured as part of the contractor selection program.  Hot work and other safe work permit programs are in place in the facility.  A process hazard analysis was conducted to identify potential hazards and areas for improvement.  Any incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and to identify changes to prevent recurrence.  The Risk Management Program is outlined and discussed in a PSM/RMP program document in use at the facility.\n\nCabot Supermetals demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety by a continued accident prevention program.  Even minor incidents and near misses are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences. In the event of an HF or other chemical release, Cabot Supermetals has in place an Emergency Response (ER) Plan, which is reviewed and updated whenever a significant change to a chemical system, including the HF process operations, occurs. All employees have been trained on the notification and evacuation procedures detailing the ER Plan.  Cabot Supermetals maintains an onsite Emergency Response Team that responds to major chemical incidents.  The team is trained to administer first aid treatment following the HF and/or othe"

Members of the team would go with any injured personnel to the hospital to ensure continued treatment appropriate for chemical exposure.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response plan establishes a written procedure to follow in the event of a release.  In the event of a major release, the plan calls for a facility evacuation and notification of the Berks County HazMat Team and the local fire department. \n\nThe emergency response plan also contains procedures to alert facility personnel of the danger potential; a list of emergency contacts; evacuation procedures and primary/secondary gathering locations; and the procedures to be implemented in the event of a fire at the facility. \n\nDuring the past five years, Cabot has experienced one accidental release that meets the criteria under the Risk Management Program regulations for inclusion on the five-year accident history. This incident occurred on July 11, 2007, in which approximately 1,250 lbs nitric oxide (NO), 535 lbs nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 94 lbs. of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and 500 lbs. of nitric acid (HNO3) were released.. The accidental release resulted in limited exposure to on-site employees that resulted in medical evaluation, but no hospitalization. In addition, nearby residents were asked to remain in their houses for approximately an hour as a precautionary measure. \n\nCabot Supermetals is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Boyertown facility.  Although no specific changes are currently planned, specific policies aimed at improving safety will be continually improved.  These policies include continuing development of best management practices; conducting site- and job-specific training and job hazard analysis; continuing coordination with the fire department, local HazMat team, and Local Emergency Planning Committee; and upholding the facility\u00bfs goal for a safe workplace.\n\nIn summary, Cabot Supermetals is fully committed to the"

      "SummaryText": "Cabot Supermetals, located in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for the employees and the community.  To this end, the management strongly supports the implementation of safe work procedures for all aspects of operation, including the processing of the one regulated substance: hydrofluoric acid, greater than 50% by weight (HF).  The facility follows the regulation and intent of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThis facility utilizes HF as an integral component of the manufacturing operations of inorganic compounds and refining of nonferrous metals.  HF is delivered to the facility in tank trucks.  Delivered HF is unloaded into one of three bulk HF storage tanks.  During delivery, the HF truck is connected at an unloading connection and compressor performs the off-loading.  At all points during delivery, a qualified facility employee and two qualified personnel from the supplier remain with the delivery truck.  From the bulk HF storage tanks, measured quantities of HF are pumped into process vessels in four buildings.  Once the HF is added to a process vessel, the concentration of HF drops below 50% by weight and is no longer regulated by RMP.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, facilities that contain a regulated substance (such as HF) at quantities exceeding the RMP threshold must consider the impact of a worst-case and an alternate-case release of the substance.  To determine the potential impact a release could have, Cabot Supermetals utilized the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the EPA and the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance reference tables and equations. \n\nAs part of this facility\u00bfs commitment to provide a safe work environment, Cabot Supermetals has implemented a number of management programs to enhance safety.  Monthly safety meetings are conducted for plant employees to evaluat"
