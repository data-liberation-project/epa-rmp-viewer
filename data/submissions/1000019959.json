As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned directly to the main suction accumulator via the suction main.\r\nThe facility was built more than 20 years ago with at least one major expansion.  More recently the following projects have occurred:\r\n\r\n  2010 - added relief vent piping so that the all relief valves were properly terminated to atmosphere     \r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency dump box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Trinity Packing Company has customized their original computerized RMP/PSM program to be more paper and facility based. This will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\nMinor staffing changes require changes to RMP-PSM facility contact information in this 4/15/14 correction.\r\n\r\n1.1\tTRINITY PACKING COMPANY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Trinity Packing Company has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigerating capacity to four (4) cold rooms, a hydrocooler, a loading dock and hallway.  The rooms utilize hanging evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  Some of the ceiling suspended coils operate under flooded conditions and some under direct expansion.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\r\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel."

The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Trinity Packing Company facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak. Our refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nTrinity Packing Company has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5\tEMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\r\nTrinity Packing Company emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\n\tCalifornia Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR A\u00a73220\r\n\tFederal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR A\u00a71910.38 \r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

This has improved our ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. Trinity Packing Company has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection/PM, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by reviewing logs in the sales office and main office.\r\n\r\nTrinity Packing Company thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Trinity Packing Company employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
