As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Trinity Packing Company has customized their original computerized RMP/PSM program to be more paper and facility based. This will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\nMinor staffing changes require changes to RMP-PSM facility contact information in this 4/15/14 correction.\n\n\n\n1.1    TRINITY PACKING COMPANY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Trinity Packing Company has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nTrinity Packing Company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2.    Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3.    Trinity Packing Company employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nTrinity Packing Company operates a commercial cold storage facility for tree fruit. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigerating capacity to four (4) cold rooms, a hydrocooler, a loading dock and hallway.  The rooms utilize hanging evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  Some of the ceiling suspended coils operate under flooded conditions and some under direct expansion.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel. "

      "SummaryText": " Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.  Some of the coils are direct expansion coils.  In those coils, high pressure ammonia liquid is piped directly to each coil where it passes through a solenoid valve, a hand expansion valve, and directly into the coil.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned directly to the main suction accumulator via the suction main.\n\nThe facility was built more than 20 years ago with at least one major expansion.  More recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n\n\n  2010 - added relief vent piping so that the all relief valves were properly terminated to atmosphere     \n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the system as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nTrinity Packing Company has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.

The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Trinity Packing Company facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak. Our refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTrinity Packing Company has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nTrinity Packing Company emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\n    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR A?3220\n\n    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR A?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Trinity Packing Company"

This has improved our ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. Trinity Packing Company has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection/PM, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by reviewing logs in the sales office and main office.\n\n\n\nTrinity Packing Company thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Trinity Packing Company employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Trinity Packing Company will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
