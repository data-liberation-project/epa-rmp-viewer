The Facility Policy \n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service Cedar Creek are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Callaway County Fire Protection District, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid and dry fertilizers for direct application as crop nutrients.  Bulk and packaged pesticides are handled and stored at this location.  The facility also stores anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks on the lot for product distribution.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored at any one time would be 91,035 pounds.  The facility has (21) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks that are used for product distribution.  At times, these nurse tanks may be filled at another facility then brought here for storage and distribution.  The plan includes cargo tank trucks that are brought into the facility to fill nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a cargo tank containing approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be based on the total contents of the cargo tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 50,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the cargo tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.50 miles.\n\n\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 1\" transfer hose during handling operations. This release is as"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
