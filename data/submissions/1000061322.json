Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDynamic Foods recognizes that it is management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of personnel are very important, and the control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Facility Safety Program.  The objectives of the Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   S"

The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is predicted to be approximately 19,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at Dynamic Foods involves the release of ~3032 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the pump recirculator-hi temp.  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  Under the assumption that wind speed is at 1.5 meters/second, ammonia could travel .7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's RMP*Comp?.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n?    The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\n?    Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pump recirculator;\n\n?    The pump recirculator is located in a low traffic area outside of the building which minimizes the possibility of loss of containment due to vehicular impact (e.g., from forklifts etc.);\n\n?
