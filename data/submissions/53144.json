Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Washington, NJ Site Implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Washington, NJ Site uses ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO), and ethylenediamine (EDA).  These chemicals are used to manufacture products such as toothpaste, mouthwashes, wastewater treatment (defoamers), fuel additives, detergents, and agricultural chemicals.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n* Gas release of ethylene oxide with off-site impact.  This RMP filing indicates the WCS is release from a fixed storage tank.\n\nAlternatives\n\n* Flange gasket leak of ethylene oxide on oxide distribution line with no off-site impacts.\n* Flange gasket leak of propylene oxide on top of PO Storage Tank with no off-site impacts.\n* Flange gasket leak of ethylenediamine on EDA on reactor recycle loop with no off-site impacts.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Process Safety Code, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.\n\nSignificant chemical-specific prevention steps that are found at the facility include:\n* Being prepared to handle unexpected rises in temperature and pressure by using automatic shut-off device and relief valves.\n* Multiple layers of protections such as safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors.\n* Identifying potential problems by continuously monitoring pressure in vessels and piping.\n* Ensuring proper operation by regularly inspecting equipmen"

This facility believes that an employees suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.\n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n* Oxide line replacement from carbon steel to stainless steel\n* Upgraded and implemented site-wide security system (guardhouse, gates and card access)\n* Changing check valves on oxide lines with fewer gaskets and leak points"
