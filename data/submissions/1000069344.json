This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Riverside Commissary senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Albertsons has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe system at 14950 Meridian Parkway March Air Reserve Basein Riverside, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, the Uniform Building Code, the Electrical Code, the California Fire Code, and the Uniform Fire Code at the time of construction.  The facility was constructed in 2007.  The ammonia system was decommissioned in 2015.  After purchasing the facility, Albertsons is planning to refill and restart the ammonia refrigeration system in April 2018.\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 52,900 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Albertsons - Riverside Commissary ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Daily inspections of the entire ammonia refrigeration system are performed by an Albertson - Riverside Commissary employee.  A refrigeration contractor performs all routine and preventative maintenance on the system.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is located inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tanks.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Albertsons - Riverside Commissary has developed a preventive maintenance "

The Albertsons safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.
