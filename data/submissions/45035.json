The facilities primary activities at this location is the blending and storing of wholesale liquid fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck or by railcar and is blended with phosphoric acid into 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer.  This blending operation is performed by a portable T-reactor and this reaction takes place twice a year, normally during one week in the spring and one week in the fall.  Anhydrous ammonia is present at the facility only during the blending operations.\n\nUnited Suppliers Inc. recognizes the portable T-reactor as part of the covered process consistent with OSHA regualtions 29 CFR Part 1910, Process Safety Management Plan.  The reactor operations may be contracted with others and covered by a separate Process Safety Management Plan (owned by the contract organization). The operation, management of change, pre-startup review, and maintenance procedures for the portable reactor operation resides with the contract organization.  The Emergency Response procedures for the Silver Creek site and contracted organization are integrated into one response, prior to the operation of the portable reactor.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. - Silver Creek, NE has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood, an"
