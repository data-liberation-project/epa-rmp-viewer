The Tampa LP Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Tampa, FL.  The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel/#2 Fuel Oil, butane, ethanol, asphalt and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nTampa LP Terminal - MPLX Terminals, LLC (Marathon) in Tampa, FL is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner.  Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Tampa LP Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community.  Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Tampa LP Terminal - MPLX Terminals, LLC is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Tampa LP Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular/blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via an automated analyzer and process controls. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, fusible elements on pneumatic valves (fail safe in the closed position), fill shutoff on the vessel, manual and automatic emergency shutoff devices on the system, HMI system display at terminal office, pressure and hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Tampa LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors as governed by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n\n\nB.
