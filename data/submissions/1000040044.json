This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Mesa RMP procedures and policies.\r\n\r\nAs for emergency response, Colorado Springs Utilities has established and maintains emergency procedures.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nMesa is located at 2715 Mesa Road in Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado.  Mesa is a surface water treatment plant consisting of the following processes:  pre-chlorination, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, post-chlorination, and stabilization.  Pre-chlorination uses an initial dose of chlorine to disinfect the incoming water and to maintain a chlorine residual throughout the treatment process.  Post-chlorination is required to boost the chlorine level to maintain disinfection throughout the distribution system.  Due to the amount of chlorine located at the Mesa, it is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nCustomers served and flow rate at the Mesa WTP is dependent on water sources, source availability, source quality and customer demand.  The Water Services Division, Water Systems Operations department of Colorado Springs Utilities operates Mesa.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION STEPS FOR CHLORINE\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Mesa RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n-Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\r\n-Hazard review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine process, id"

Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Mesa RMP for the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the Mesa) and actively participated in a comprehensive hazard review.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by com"

In the event of a release of chlorine in the storage room, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the chlorine-contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThis facility is included in the Colorado Springs LEPC Emergency Response Program.  In addition, Mesa has established and maintains emergency procedures, which includes an evacuation and notification plan.  The goals of the established procedures are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The procedures are routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  Colorado"

Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
