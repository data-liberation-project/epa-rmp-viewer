We are committed to supplying consumers with quality product and maintaining a safe environment for our employees, visitors, and community.  Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration systems.  Ammonia is used in coolers, freezers, and production rooms to keep the chicken at appropriate temperatures.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system within the piping and vessels located in our facility.\n\nA) Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  Farmer's Pride, Inc. has implemented many precautionary measures to minimize accidental releases of ammonia from its refrigeration system.  Precautions include safety controls (Manning ammonia detection system, automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could casue system malfunctions.  In addition, all maintenance personnel performing preventive maintenance on the system are qualified and thoroughly trained.  Maintenance personnel are required to follow the written standard operating procedures (sop's) developed for each maintenance task performed on the system.  The Maintenance Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\nB) Stationary source and regulated substance handled:  Farmer's Pride, Inc. operates a refrigeration system with an ammonia inventory of approximately 16,277 pounds. \n \nC) Accidental Release Prevention Program:  Farmer's Pride, Inc. maintains an Accidental Release Prevetnion Program that complies with 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.
