      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - POLYCOAT PRODUCTS - Santa Fe Springs Facility\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPolycoat Products, a division of American Polymers Corporation, has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the TDI Storage and Transfer System to enhance its already existing safety programs.  Polycoat Products is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees, visitors and its neighbors.  Polycoat Products staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The TDI Transfer System, that contains the regulated substance Toluene Di-Isocyanate (TDI), is used for supplying TDI to the polymer production reactors in the process area.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nPolycoat Products has an emergency response plan in place to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include specific steps that Polycoat Products management expects of its employees to take to protect health of the employees, visitors and the neighbors.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, and instructions for evacuation and for actions to be taken in case of a fire, injury, earthquake and chemical spill.  The Emergency Plan is reviewed and updated periodically to ensure that it remains current.  \r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe TDI Transfer System consists of a double walled storage tank, a transfer pump, piping,valves and a bank of scrubbers that are used during the filling operation,.  TDI storage tank is designed for truck and marine transport like a containerize"
