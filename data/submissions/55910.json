The processes at the plant include mixing, sedimentation control, flocculation, filtration, aeration, clarification, and chlorination of waste water from the City of Columbus with discharge to the East Fork of the White River.  The only regulated substances used at the plant are chlorine anhydrous sulfur dioxide.  The facility purchases pressurized cylinders that are filled with 2,000 pounds of liquified chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  A total of 10,000 pounds of each of these substances could be stored at the plant at any one time.\n\n\nAccidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Columbus WWTP  is covered by the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know (EPCRA) program and the OSHA Process Management Plan requirements.

      "SummaryText": "ns and the environment is the potential toxic release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases.  Potential releases of chlorine gas could occur from pressurized cylinders damaged during unloading and potential release from material failure of the vacuum relief valve on each gas cylinder.  The facility has the following process controls in place to reduce the risk of chlorine and sulfur dioxide: vessel relief valves, manual shutoff controls, automatic shutoffs, gas detection alarms, and rupture disks.  When the outer access doors to the gas cylinder storage room are closed, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage building provides significant passive control and mitigation of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases escape from the facility.  Pursuant to U.S. EPA guidance, the storage building passive control could reduce the rate of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases release to the environment by approximately 55%.  Chlorine gas leaks can be detected through the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas sensors within the storage room area and in the process room.\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Columbus has a strong commitment to the protection of the public and environment from releases of hazardous chemicals from any of its facilities.  The individual facility managers are responsible for safe operating and maintenance of all potentially hazardous treatment processes as well as the enforcement of emergency response policies.  Guidance and policies for the handling of accidental releases of hazardous substances at its facilities are provided by: 1) a Process Safety Management Plan (June 1999); and a 2) Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (under the direction of the Office of Emergency Preparedness.  All personnel that work with facilities process equipment using hazardous substances, receive training in safety and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant Manager of the Columbus WWTP has stated that the facility "

The EAP is included in the Bartholemew County Local Emergency Planning Commission emergency response and contingency plan.  The Columbus WWTP employees of the City of Columbus Utilities Department are trained in emergency response procedures and practices on the job on a regular basis by qualified senior staff and management.  Employees receive training on responding to emergency releases of hazardous chemicals."
