      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Publix) Atlanta Distribution and Manufacturing Facility is located at 445 Hurricane Trail, Dacula, Gwinnett County, Georgia.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site. A site PSM Coordinator is appointed to facilitate compliance. Publix's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution and Manufacturing Facility (Atlanta Facility) is located on the north side of State Road 316 just east of the boundary between Lawerenceville and Dacula, Georgia.  The facility includes an Automatic Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Publix Super Markets as well as a Manufacturing facility that produces milk, ice cream, and other dairy products.  These two ammonia refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The manufacturing facility's equipment is located in the perishable warehouse and in the compressor room.  A control pressure receiver (CPR) is located inside this room.  The CPR in this process is the largest capacity vessel at the facility; however, High Pressure Receiver (HPR) at the ASRS process is located outside the machinery room resulting in a longer endpoint distance than the larger CPR at the dairy.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThe Atlanta Facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and  the processes are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this place"

The Atlanta Facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \n\nThe Manufacturing facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.   It includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  The ASRS Warehouse program mirrors the program in place at the manufacturing facility.\n\nIn developing the PSM Program, the facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures help to ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.\n\nOther components of the prevention program include collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  The staff ensures that if equipment design deficiencies are identified that they are corrected.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.\n\nTo ensure that the Atlanta Facility's refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, they are included in a refrigeration training program.  The training program includes Process Hazards Analyses, Operating Procedures, Maintenance Procedures, Emergency Resp"

The Ammonia Refrigeration Staff, with the assistance of a consultant, performed a PHA of the dairy process at the appropriate intervals since 1995.    A PHA of the ASRS refrigeration processs was initially performed in 2004 prior to startup and revalidations have been performed since then at the required intervals.  Additional PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation also ensure the continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.  \n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Atlanta Facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in offsite consequences in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Atlanta Facility has an Ammonia Emergency Response Plan (AERP) in place.  The site also has internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  Publix responders receive \"HAZMAT\" refresher training annually and the current plan has been coordinated with the Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency Services.  In an emergency involving ammonia, facility responders work with the fire department on response.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 or contacting the State Notification point at 1-800-241-4113.\n\n6. Plans to Improve Safety\n\nThe Publix Atlanta Distribution Center Industrial Refrigeration Manager prepares a monthly safety plan which is posted on SharePoint for management; the safety plan includes safety walks, equipment familiarization for new associates, key performance indicator trending, etc."
