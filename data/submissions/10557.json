The GOHDS Process yields desulfurized gas oil, low sulfur diesel, naphtha, light ends, and purified hydrogen.\nThe prevention program for this process is the same as that identified in the Executive Summary.  For requests for dates for Prevention Program requirements required to be in place prior to submitting the first RMP Plan, it is possible that additional changes and activities have been initiated between the date given in the RMP Plan and the submission date because of the ongoing nature of many of these activities.  For the RMP Prevention Program requirements that were complied with as a result of the similar requirements of OSHA 1910.119 - Process Safety Management (PSM), such as process safety information, PHA, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors, the date of the work used for PSM compliance is given. For the RMP Prevention Program requirements which are not required to be undertaken pursuant to the RMP regulation before the time the first RMP is due, such as compliance audits and incident investigations, the date field is left blank.",

              "Description": "The Catalytic Polymerization (Cat Poly) Process produces gasoline blending component (Poly-gasoline), propane, and butane products from a feed stream made up of propane, propylene, butane, and butylene (collectively called P-B's).  The olefin compounds (propylene and butylene) combine to form gasoline boiling range compounds in a polymerization reaction.  This reaction takes place in the reactor vessels on the surface of the solid catalyst.\nThe prevention program for this process is the same as that identified in the Executive Summary.   For requests for dates for Prevention Program requirements required to be in place prior to submitting the first RMP Plan, it is possible that additional changes and activities have been initiated between the date given in the RMP Plan and the submission date because of the ongoing nature of many of these activities.  For the RMP Prevention Program requirements that were complied with as a result of the similar requirements of OSHA 1910.119 - Process Safety Management (PSM), such as process safety information, PHA, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors, the date of the work used for PSM compliance is given. For the RMP Prevention Program requirements which are not required to be undertaken pursuant to the RMP regulation before the time the first RMP is due, such as compliance audits and incident investigations, the date field is left blank.",

The Flare process ensures that products are not released to the atmosphere during overpressuring or depressuring of equipment, by routing vapors and/or liquid to the knockout drum and flare tip.  Vapors are burned at the flare, while liquid is collected in knockout drums and eventually returned to the processes.\nThe prevention program for this process is the same as that identified in the Executive Summary.   For requests for dates for Prevention Program requirements required to be in place prior to submitting the first RMP Plan, it is possible that additional changes and activities have been initiated between the date given in the RMP Plan and the submission date because of the ongoing nature of many of these activities.  For the RMP Prevention Program requirements that were complied with as a result of the similar requirements of OSHA 1910.119 - Process Safety Management (PSM), such as process safety information, PHA, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors, the date of the work used for PSM compliance is given.

Preventing accidental releases is a key component to achieve these goals.  The Conoco Denver Refinery utilizes a variety of activities, as described below in the accident prevention program, to systematically reduce the chances of an accidental release.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, employees are trained to promptly respond to minimize the release, and a group of volunteer employees are trained in emergency response techniques, including fire fighting with the refinery's own fire trucks and other equipment.  The Conoco Denver Refinery's policy is to be able to respond to any emergencies within the refinery, and to train with the local Fire Department to be prepared in the event of an emergency beyond the refinery's capabilities.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THIS STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nConoco Inc. is a major integrated energy company, and began marketing operations in Denver in 1876 as the Continental Oil Company.  Conoco's Denver Refinery is actually in Commerce City, Colorado, northeast of downtown Denver.  The refinery started small in 1931 with 16 employees, and was the country's first continuous-processing crude oil refinery.  The refinery has expanded and now employs more than 200 people, and p"

The refinery's products include three grades of gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, propane, butane, paving asphalt, and sulphur.  \nThe refinery has a number of processes to take the crude oil, which is actually a mixture of materials, and refine them into the variety of products.  These processes have been evaluated to determine the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substances used or present in the processes.  Due to its nature as a petroleum refinery, the refinery has a number of regulated flammable substances as products, intermediates, and as materials used in the various processes.  The refinery also has several of the RMP listed toxic substances, but none at the quantity or concentration specified in the regulation.  Practices are in place to protect employees, and therefore the community and the environment, from the flammables and the toxics.\n\nTHE RMP REGULATORY DEFINED WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\nConoco's Denver Refinery followed the EPA guidelines to estimate a \"Worst Case Scenario\" and an \"Alternative Release Scenario,\" or what kinds of events could possibly occur that could impact the community.  Following the EPA requirements, the Conoco Denver Refinery has evaluated its processes to identify these scenarios.  There are no scenarios to report for any toxics, and there is one 'Worst Case Scenario' to report for all of the flammables.  This scenario is the estimate of the release of the contents in the largest single vessel containing propane in a mixture (1,400,000 pounds), an explosion, and estimating the distance to the 1 psi endpoint.  If that release occurred following the EPA guidance for weather and other conditions, it is estimated the resulting 1 psi endpoint would be approximately 0.9  miles from the refinery.  This pressure wave could shatter windows and damage some buildings outside the refinery.  No credit was taken for the admi"

This worst case scenario is very unlikely because of the measures taken to safely operate this vessel, including the location and maintenance of the vessel, and the training and procedures followed by employees while operating and maintaining this vessel.  \n\nThe 'Alternative Release Scenario' is an estimate of an accidental release of a smaller amount of the same flammable material, with the pressure wave endpoint about 0.3 miles away from the refinery.  The event used to estimate the Alternative Release Scenario was a break in a line carrying the propane mixture, and took into consideration the ability of employees to detect and stop the release within approximately 15 minutes.\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe RMP also requires the Conoco Denver Refinery to report certain accidents that had specific on-site, community, or environmental impacts in the past 5 years.  The people that work at the Conoco Denver Refinery are proud of their safety record.  There are no accidents to report based on the results of interviews of employees and a review of safety and environmental records from June 1, 1999, back to June 1, 1994.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program in place at the Conoco Denver Refinery.  Eleven processes at the Refinery are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, which took effect in 1992.  The accidental release prevention program requirements in the RMP are almost identical to the OSHA PSM standards, with the PSM requirements focused on worker safety and the EPA RMP focused on the community and the environment.  This is a summary of how these requirements are addressed and describes how the system is implemented to help prevent acci"

Effective Process Safety Management is dependent on the knowledge and contribution of every employee involved with the operation and maintenance of the processes.  Refinery employees have been and will continue to be involved with the implementation and ongoing practice of Process Safety Management and accident prevention.\n\nRefinery Management understands their role, which includes the commitment of resources to implement site PSM and RMP policies and procedures and to sustain and continually improve safety.  As part of their role, each element of the PSM regulation, and the corresponding RMP accidental release prevention element, has been assigned to a member of the Denver Refinery Leadership Team to monitor the status of the element. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThere is a written Employee Participation Plan that describes how employees participate in PSM and the RMP accidental release prevention program development and implementation, and how employees have access to the information they need to do their jobs safely.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling procedures, conducting inspections and tests on equipment, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, and actively participating in management of change, pre-start-up safety reviews, contractor evaluations, compliance audits and incident investigations.  This intensive and widespread involvement of a variety of employees is considered key to the effectiveness and sustainability of the accident prevention efforts.  \nThere are also two standing teams for employee consultation on the development and implementation of all elements of PSM and the accident prevention requirements of RMP.

There is a sub-team of the Joint Health and Safety Committee, known as the Process Safety Management Coordination Team that includes union represented employees and salaried members of operating, mechanical, and management groups.  This team is primarily responsible for sustaining and continually improving PSM and the accident prevention requirements of RMP in the long term within the refinery. \n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nAs part of compliance with PSM and RMP, the refinery maintains current information on the chemicals, technology, and equipment in its processes covered by the PSM and RMP regulations.  \n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) provide the information about the chemicals in the process.  This chemical-specific information includes exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  \n\nFor the technology and equipment of the process, written information is collected and validated by a variety of employees.  The technology information includes the processes' chemistry, intended inventories, safe upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions, and the consequences of deviation from the limits.  The refinery maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, procedures, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.   \n   \nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

The Conoco Denver Refinery uses recognized methodologies to conduct the analysis, including the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique and a What-If/Checklist.  These analyses have been conducted on each process covered by RMP as part of the PSM program, and the analyses will be updated and revalidated at least once every five years.  Each analysis is done by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations for the process being evaluated.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as previous incidents and accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team then makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe Team's findings and recommendations are reviewed by Refinery management and an appropriate response is determined, documented and an action plan developed.  \nProgress on the action plan is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  All refinery employees are advised of the analyses in advance for the opportunity to provide input, and employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions are advised.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor each process covered by the RMP or PSM regulations, the Conoco Denver Refinery maintains and has implemented written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such a"

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the control rooms and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining for Operators\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, there is training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations, including classroom work and field observations, if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Operators are also trained before operating a newly assigned process. \n\nAffected operators are informed of and/or trained on any changes to the procedures.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained and assure they understand and follow the current procedures.
