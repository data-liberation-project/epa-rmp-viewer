If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Lewis county LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n2.\tFacility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 180,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm is 2.6 mile.\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario: a 1 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before a remote manual is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .03 mile.\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Humphrey Feed and Seed Facility complies with EPA\u00c2\u00bfs accident prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and installed and is maintained in accordance with applicable local, state and federal regulations.\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\nThe Humphrey Feed and Seed facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that cause deaths, injuries, propert"
