      "SummaryText": "1)  THE FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management, and employees of Sure Crop Care, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. 2) FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 52,530 pounds in our two 6,000 gallon storage tanks.  3)  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:  a) the worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 52,530 pounds in two 6,000 gallon tanks in Wiley, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 220 ppm) is .67 miles.  b) the alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 220 ppm) is .67 miles.  4)  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements For The Storage And Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institue, Inc., and The Standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  5)  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, "

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
