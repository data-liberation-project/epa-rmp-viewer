Our employees strive for safety, health, and environmental excellence in all aspects of Covestro's activities while meeting our business objectives.\r\nWithout exception, every Covestro employee is responsible for working safely.  Safety is the top responsibility at all levels of management and supervision.   Managers and supervisors are expected to set an example with their own behavior.  The design, operation, maintenance, and regular inspections of Covestro facilities safeguard employees and the public.  Covestro works to make its operations safer by continually improving safety and health measures.\r\n\r\nThe Corporate Policy on Health, Safety, Environment and Quality states:\r\n\r\n\"It is our core belief that health, safety, environmental protection and energy performance as well as product and process quality and commercial efficiency are of equal importance in achieving our corporate objectives. We are signatories to the Global Charter of Responsible Care&reg; - a worldwide initiative of the chemical industry - as a commitment by management and all of our employees to drive continuous improvement and to achieve excellence in the HSEQ areas. \"\r\n\r\nHealth \r\n\r\nWe make continual progress towards the goal of no harm to health from products and operations. We continually improve the quality of the health benefits provided for employees in many countries to prevent ill health. We encourage awareness of healthy lifestyles, especially in view of the challenges facing us as a result of demographic changes and the rising retirement age in many countries. \r\n\r\nSafety\r\n \r\nSafety management and the continuous development of our safety culture are cornerstones of our corporate responsibility.

According to our mantra \"Nothing we do is worth getting hurt for\" we strive for a reduction of hazards targeting a Recordable Incident Rate (RIR) - the total number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time employees - of zero. \r\nProcess safety relates to the secure and reliable operation of our plants. It is essential to the health and well-being of our employees and neighbors, and hence to our success. We continually identify, reduce and manage process safety risks. For example by monitoring the Loss of Primary Containment (LoPC) - which means the leakage of chemicals from primary containers, such as pipelines, pumps, tanks and drums - to improve the reliability of our operations. We handle dangerous substances in a fully responsible manner to maintain the trust of society and the authorities.\r\nProduct stewardship is about design and development, production, handling, packaging, storage, transportation and the use of our products. All of this must be safe and efficient and, after proper use, our products should be available for recycling and safe for disposal.\r\n\r\nEnvironment & Energy\r\n\r\nWe constantly work to lessen the environmental impact of our activities, products and services, and to develop innovative solutions that support our customers in improving their resource efficiency and reducing emissions. Resource-efficient processes in our operations help to protect the environment and at the same time cut the costs associated with materials, energy, emissions and disposal management.\r\nEconomic and environmental considerations encourage us to use resources, materials and energy conscientiously. This also includes topics such as water scarcity and the purchase of resource and energy-efficient products and services as appropriate.\r\n\r\nQuality\r\n\r\nWe set high standards in terms of the quality of the raw materials and the"

We strive to improve the quality of our activities and offerings to the satisfaction of our customers and stakeholders and hence to our benefit.\r\nFor the operational implementation of these commitments, we have established an Integrated Management System covering all HSEQ aspects. We have also defined rules and regulations that comply with internationally recognized standards. We are committed to continually improve our Integrated Management System through, for example, results of analysis and evaluation, open dialogue with stakeholders and the outputs from management reviews.\r\nTo this end, our objectives regarding health, occupational, process and plant safety, environment, energy and quality are expressed as specific and measurable targets on which we openly report. The achievement of these targets is supported with appropriate resources and information and the same diligence as economic goals.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Facility\r\n\r\nLocated in West Chambers County on 1,700 acres along Cedar Bayou, Covestro's first operating units came on line in 1971 with steady growth continuing over the next 40+ years.  The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Covestro's largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as an industrial park, approximately 35% of the Covestro acreage is developed.  Covestro hosts five guest facilities (Air Products, Lanxess, Hexion, El Dorado Nitrogen and United Salt) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\r\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail, and truck as well as pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\r\nPrimarily supporting the automotive and construction industries, products manufactured by Covestro Baytown include: \r\n\u00bf\tpolycarbonate thermoplastic (used in CD/DVDs, auto and optical lenses, medical supplies and sports equipment)\r\n\u00bf\tr"
