Martinez Water Treatment Plant\nThe City of Tempe Water Utilities Department (CoT-WUD) operates a safe, efficient water treatment facility at the Johnny G. Martinez Plant which provides high quality drinking water to the citizens of Tempe, Arizona.\nThe CoT- WUD developed this document to meet the requirements for a Program 3, Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Accidental Release Prevention Program, Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for its water chlorination process located at the Johnny G. Martinez Plant (JGMWTP), 255 East Marigold Lane, Tempe, Arizona.\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\nThe CoT- WUD prepared this RMP revision using the past submittal with the appropriate updates included.\n\nThe City of Tempe Water Utilities Department Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\nThe CoT-WUD's policy is to conduct all operations in a safe manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program. The CoT- WUD trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment. A chlorine gas detection system operates continuously in the areas where chlorine is stored or used for chlorination of water.\n In the event of an emergency, the CoT- WUD will contact the Tempe Fire Department to respond. A designated emergency contact for the plant initiates emergency notifications. All employees are trained in the proper procedures and their appropriate role in an emergency. The JGMWTP maintains a highly cooperative relationship with the Tempe Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of the chlorination system and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated subst"

      "SummaryText": "ances.\n\nGeneral Description of Regulated Substance and Stationary Source\nThe City of Tempe's Johnny G. Martinez Water Treatment Plant is located at 255 East Marigold Lane, Tempe, Arizona. The JGMWTP supplies drinking water to residents and businesses in Tempe. Pressurized containers of liquid chlorine are stored and used at the plant. The gaseous chlorine is connected to the chlorine injection process so that small amounts of chlorine gas are added to the water as a disinfectant. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this process is 22131, Water supply and Irrigation Systems. Chlorine is a dense, greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor. Chlorine used at the plant is contained in metal vessels designed to Department of Transportation standards. The containers are stored and used in a concrete building with a chlorine gas detection system and a ventilation/scrubber system. The ventilation/scrubber system is designed to neutralize a release of chlorine gas should it occur. \n\nSummary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe CoT WUD's release prevention program complies with Federal Accidental Release Prevention requirements for chlorine. The city of Tempe's prevention program emphasizes thorough training for its employees in hazard communication; proper handling, transfer, storage, and use methods; and awareness level emergency response. The CoT- WUD's standard operating procedures include diligent observation of the chlorine systems vessels, piping, valves, and other equipment. The chlorination system is designed and constructed in accordance with Chlorine Institute standards and Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for safety. Secondary containment designed to contain a liquid chlorine release is present in the chlorination building. A chlorine leak detection system monitors the inside and outside of the chlorination building continuously for chlorine."

      "FacilityID": 37643,
      "SummaryText": " If a chlorine release is detected by the sensors, an audible and visual alarm will sound to initiate emergency response procedures and the ventilation/scrubber system is automatically activated. \n\nSummary of Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents or accidental releases involving the JGMWTP chlorine system in the last five years.\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\nThe CoT- WUD's JGMWTP facility has a written Emergency Response Plan. The focus of the plan is to protect the public, employees, public property, and the JGMWTP facilities. The facility uses a continuous chlorine detection system to monitor for a release 24 hours a day. Immediately after discovering a release of chlorine, JGM personnel are instructed to notify the Tempe Fire Department for initial response and evacuate the area affected by the release. The Tempe Fire Department will be the primary responder to a chlorine release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe CoT- WUD JGMWTP has an excellent safety record and is continually evaluating ways to improve safety at the site. JGMWTP operators and maintenance personnel are trained and updated in the hazards of chlorine and proper operation of the chlorine system.\nThe CoT- WUD is currently working on an upgrade of the water disinfection procedure by instituting the use of on-site generated liquid sodium hypochlorite instead of gaseous chlorine. Ultimate removal of gaseous chlorine will improve the overall safety and reduce the hazards associated with chlorine handling and storage."
