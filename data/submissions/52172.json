As required by the U.S. EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68, the facility's RMP must be fully updated and resubmitted at least once every 5 years.  Therefore, the 5-year anniversary date for resubmission is set as 5 years from June 21, 1999 or June 21, 2004.  AK Steel completed their 5 year resubmittal on June 17, 2004.  AK Steel had an independent RMP audit and PHA update performed in October 2007.  The necessary changes identified in these reports were completed by the end of November 2007.  The Emergency Contact changed from Johnson Controls to RMI Intl., Security on June 18, 2008.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAK Steel Corporation in Middletown, Ohio complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68, we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. \n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  The Middletown facility's Risk Management System has clearly defined li"

AK Steel's safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nAK Steel's Middletown, Ohio manufacturing facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (112r) of the Clean Air Act, due to two on-site processes containing regulated chemicals above their threshold quantities.  Hydrogen, a regulated flammable substance, is present above the 10,000 pound threshold.   Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold.  Hydrogen meets the criteria for Program 1; and Ammonia is Program 3.  Thus, the remainder of this summary does not include the hydrogen process, as it is not subject to the prevention and emergency response requirements of EPA's RMP rules.\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Middletown facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention program rules for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Middletown facility.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, ANSI, API, other industry codes and standards.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia and all identified problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia equipment and operations.\n\n\n4.  Five-year Acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident History\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in offsite impacts of any kind.  However, during the past five years, there has been one reportable accident related to the ammonia process at AK Steel Middletown Works resulting in a Section 68.10(b)(1) listed consequence (death, injury, or environmental restoration).  This accidental release occurred in August of 2003 during which approximately 9,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released over a period of 42 hours.  No deaths were associated with this accident; however, the release did result in one reported injury where medical treatment was provided for a contractor employee affected by the release.  The ammonia release was contained within plant boundaries and did not result in any offsite evacuations.  There was some onsite soil contamination requiring environmental restoration.  The following presents a description of this accident:\n\nOn August 22, 2003, a vapor end release of anhydrous ammonia occurred from an equipment failure associated with a contractor?s tanker truck.  A leak developed from a weld seam located at the top of the tanker during the transfer of the anhydrous ammonia from one of the plant?s ammonia process storage tanks.  AK Steel?s emergency action plan was implemented immediately.  Offsite responders including the fire department and HAZMAT team were called, responded to the incident, and contained the release onsite within plant property boundaries.  There was one reported injury in which the personnel exposed to the release received medical treatment.  Further details pertaining to this accident can be found in the U.S. EPA?s RMP*Submit Document (EPA Form 8700-25), Section 6: Five Year Accident History as well as on AK Steel?s Incident Investigation Summary Form (Form M-6244) dated August 22, 2003.  \n\nAs a result of this accident, AK Steel took immediate steps to revise the operating procedures contained in their Quality Standard Opera"

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program at the Middletown facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Butler County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Middletown Fire Department.  The AK Steel response team trains and drills monthly.  We have conducted annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors."
