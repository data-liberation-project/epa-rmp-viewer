The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. A completed PSSR is required prior to introducing hazardous materials to the process.\ni.\tCompliance Audits\nThe last compliance audit for the facility was completed in July 2023. NovaStar will conduct compliance audits every three years. \nj.\tIncident Investigation\nNovaStar investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of formaldehyde. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation (conditions and causes) leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Incident Investigation reports related to the Covered Process are retained for a minimum of five years. \nk.\tEmployee Participation \nNovaStar has developed a written employee participation plan. Employees at the Midland are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend measures for improvement.  \nl.\tContractors \nNovaStar trains contract employees on potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the Covered Process. Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of formaldehyde occur while they are present. \n4.\tFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents that resulted in the release of the covered chemicals within the 5-year tracking period.\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nNovaStar complies with applicable federal, state, and local regulations related to emergency response plans.

This is done through training of onsite personnel and contractors working on the site, the use of various safeguards to control hazards associated with potentially hazardous work, and the use of alarms during operations to detect anomalies in process operations.\nThe emergency response plan is to notify local first responders of the emergency, provide NovaStar personnel with an evacuation plan, and then provide technical assistance to authorities as needed. NovaStar reviews and updates its policy annually. \n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nNovastar has one regulated substance at the Midland facility. The facility is a chemical manufacturing and distribution plant that manufactures chemicals and distributes release chemicals to other manufactures as well as end users primarily in the oil & gas industry. \nThe process uses formaldehyde solution, to produce a variety of products.\nThe facility is subject to Program Level 3 RMP requirements.
