The Company provides freezing, storage, handling and exporting services to a variety of poultry, seafood, vegetable and meat customers.  The facility comprises 1,500,000 million cubic feet of sub-zero storage space as well as 25,000 cubic feet of cooler space. In addition, the operation is capable of blast freezing 500,000 pounds of product daily.  Facility construction consists of masonry, block and insulated panels.  The refrigeration system is a two-stage anhydrous ammonia system with temperature range capabilities of ?20 to +40 degrees Fahrenheit.  The Company handles and stores 25,640 pounds of ammonia at this location.  Extensive investment in the facility since 1993 has resulted in a modern, updated refrigeration plant and engine room.\n\n\n\n    Shoreland Freezers celebrated its 57th Anniversary in the fall of 2003, and is privately owned and operated (2nd generation).  The management team consists of its President, Warehouse Manager, and Plant Engineer.  The facility has a 57-year history of safe operation and has never had a reportable ammonia loss or leak. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\n    The Management Team at Shoreland is dedicated to the overall safety of its employees, its customers? product and its neighbors.  This team also constitutes the company?s Safety Committee. The team meets onsite monthly with an independent safety consulting company, Safety Resources, LLC, for employee training, safety meetings and semi-annual plant inspections.  Since 1992 the company has been inspected once by a MOSH industrial hygienist and once by a MOSH safety inspector. In both cases there were no citations of substance and only a few minor recommendations for changes. The Company a"

Additionally, the Company has and continues to utilize the loss-prevention inspection services of its own insurance companies to maintain a safe facility.\n\n    \n\n    The Shoreland Freezers ?Employee Handbook?, in Section 7.2, specifically addresses safety issues, and all organizational functions (job descriptions) address the requirement for safety.\n\n\n\n    The Company has, over the past several years, invested substantial sums of money in both facility upgrades and training to improve its overall safety environment. Prior to 1996 the refrigeration system was primarily comprised of older, reciprocating compressors with manual controls and no alarms. Since that time, millions of dollars have been invested in state-of-the-art equipment with microprocessor controls, alarm sensors and off-site monitoring services.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\n    Shoreland Freezers attempts to comply with all regulations in order to stay successful and an integral part of the local economy and business community.  The Company is regulated by many different agencies including OSHA, MOSH, USDA, FDA, MDE, MDH and the EPA.  Specific to this summary, complying with the OSHA PSM rule and now the EPA RMP has made Shoreland Freezers a safer employer, vendor and neighbor.  Substantial investment, improved maintenance routines and employee training have all helped to improve our prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\n    Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10 (b) (1)).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\n    Shoreland Freezers has adopted an Emergency Response Program as required under the ?OSHA HAZWOPER? standard.  This program addresses process hazard analysis, management of change procedures, incident investigation, standard operating procedures, emergency"

The Program was subject to an extended MOSH safety inspection from August 1997 to February 1998.  The Program passed that inspection and audit.  Additionally, the Company has now adopted the EPA?s ?Risk Management Program for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68) in its effort to evaluate worst-case alternative-case release scenarios.\n\n\n\n    Periodic inspections and visits are arranged with the Salisbury Fire Department Headquarters Company.  They have drawings on-hand of the plant facility and a database of information specific to our facility. In addition, the City of Salisbury and Wicomico County have both provided funding in this year?s budget to provide equipment and training for a hazardous response team. Shoreland has offered its facility to the team for training purposes. Fire hydrants are located at both street entrances to the facility.\n\n\n\n    Applicable employees have received copies of the ?Emergency Response Procedures, Shoreland Freezers?.  The ?Liaison Officer? maintains Federal, State and Local ?Right-To-Know? contact information on-site and off-site at all times.\n\n\n\n    The engine room facility is actively monitored weekdays from 7:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  Weekends and holidays require daily checks in person by maintenance personnel. Additionally, the Plant Engineer can connect from his home to the computerized engine room software control program to monitor and operate equipment. This program is also loaded on a computer at the other end of the facility from the hazardous materials, and is on a portable laptop computer. The plant is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 day a year for burglary, fire, smoke, leaks and equipment failure by an off-premises alarm company.  Primary emergency response personnel are equipped with pagers and cell phones.  Additionally, a two-w"
