Working alongside our clients AFCO delivers expertise and hands-on support to help meet sanitation, compliance, and operational needs efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\n\n\nThe 99,000 square-foot Marietta warehouse facility serves as a site for the distribution and manufacturing of AFCO cleaning, sanitation, and maintenance products. Many of these products are manufactured under strict quality control procedures since these products are utilized in industries making consumer products, food, and beverages. AFCO provides a full range of services connected with our products, including consultation, training, equipment designed to deliver our products, and customer site service.\n\n\n\nThe peracetic acid products which are produced on site are packaged in various containers, including 330-gallon totes and 55-gallon drums. The warehouse section of the facility stores and ships these products to customers. Peracetic acid manufacturing and product packaging are conducted in a 5,200 square foot room in the facility that can be isolated from the general plant manufacturing and warehousing facilities.\n\n\n\nBased on the materials handled, and offsite consequence analysis, the Marietta facility is characterized as a Program Level 2 facility.\n\n\n\nAFCO implements an accidental release prevention policy to ensure compliance with the EPA RMP regulation. The accidental release prevention program includes:\n\nProcess Safety Information, which includes:\n\no   SDS sheets for products containing peracetic acid;\n\no   safety information for the peracetic acid system and process chemistry;\n\no   inventory wh"
