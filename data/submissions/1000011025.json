Anhydrous ammonia is the RMP-regulated substance at the Delaware City CO2 Plant. The ammonia is used in the process as a refrigerant to cool and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  The plant has eleven full-time employees\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a hazardous chemical and subjected to federal and state laws.   Air Liquide has established policy and procedures to manage the industrial system and process that contains the ammonia in accordance with applicable regulations in particular OSHAA?s PSM (26CFR1910.119) and EPAA?s RMP (40CFR68) regulations.  \n\nThe Delaware City CO2 PlantA?s risk management program (Risk Management Plan) contains the technical and process information required to safely maintain and operate the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and minimize the risk of an accidental release of ammonia to the environment.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operational limits for key process parameters. The risk management program  encourages the employees to participate in the process safety management and accident prevention through ongoing training and communication on all key elements such as Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change (MOC), Pre-Startup Safety Review, and Incident Reporting and Investigation.\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the Delaware City CO2 Plant anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system was performed in 1994 and the most recent revalidation was completed in 2009.   The results of the PHA serve as the basis to improve the Risk Management Plan.  Inspections and audits are also an integral part of Air Liquide Process Safety "

The Delaware City CO2 Plant is subject to inspections and audits by the Air Liquide Health, Safety and Environmental and Risk Management departments.  \n\nAir Liquide has developed and maintains an emergency action plan for the Delaware City CO2 Plant.  In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, the Delaware City CO2 Plant will respond defensively by notifying (and then assisting with any needed process information) the HMHTTC emergency response team that there is a need to respond to a release of the regulated substance.  HMHTTC Response, Inc. specializes in emergency response and has been set up to lead emergency response efforts for the Delaware City CO2 Plant.  The Delaware City CO2 Plant maintains communications with the Delaware City Fire Department (FD) as part of its Risk Management emergency response planning and is a member of DC CAER, the Delaware Industrial Complex mutual assistance group.  In the event of a release the Delaware City CO2 Plant will notify Delaware City FD, New Castle Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and DC CAER along with other State and Federal Emergency agencies.  If release is expected to have offsite consequences that could impact the community, the Delaware City FD and the New Castle LEPC will direct the appropriate community response (evacuation, shelter-in-place).  \n\nThe Delaware City CO2 Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention.  In the past five years, there has not been an accident that has caused deaths, injuries, property damage or environmental damage, nor one requiring evacuation or shelter-in-place for the surrounding community.\n"
