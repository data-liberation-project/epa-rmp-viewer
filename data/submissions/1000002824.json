      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nThe Seneca Foods Corporation Buhl, Idaho facility is a seasonal canned and frozen vegetable processor.  Principal products include canned baby whole carrots and sweet corn, frozen sugar snap peas and frozen sweet corn products.  The facility also operates a year round dry storage warehouse, a labeling center for canned products, a frozen corn on the cob packaging operation, and a 102,000 square foot frozen storage warehouse.  Approximately 49,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the product freezing operations and less than 10,000 pounds as a refrigerant in the frozen storage warehouse.  It is the policy of Seneca Foods Corporation to assure safe and healthful working conditions for every employee and to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations including OSHA Process Safety Management and Federal Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act.  Seneca will provide adequate safeguards against health and safety hazards by providing a safe work environment, job training and instruction on safe procedures, by making personal protective gear available, and by proper administration of safety programs and activities.  To reduce the risk of accidental ammonia release there are engineering and mechanical safeguards in place including physical barriers to protect ammonia lines and vessels, high level cutoff controls, relief valves, and a PLC based monitoring and operating system with built in alarms and controls.  A documented maintenance program is in place to ensure mechanical integrity of the refrigeration systems including an annual pre-start safety review, safety inspection checklist for each component of the system, and annual post season review of the system by an outside expert. A Compliance Audit of the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan is conducted every three years by an outside source and new operators are trained locally prior to operating the systems.  There have been no reportable ammonia releas"
