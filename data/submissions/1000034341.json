Plant in Orange, California, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce bedding, furniture, and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in outdoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 680,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head or reactor  where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is con"

TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceed EPAA's threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\r\n\r\nThe FXI, INC. facility has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the storage, usage, and receiving of regulated materials.  The FXI, INC. facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated materials.  FXI, INC. has a Spill, Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan on file with the County of Orange Health Care Agency, Environmental Health.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.    \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps (continued)\r\n\t\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\t\r\n-\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n-\tTrained emergency response personnel\r\n-\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\n\r\nWe have had no releases of TDI in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe FXI, INC. facility has submitted an Emergency Response Plan which includes the facilities Hazardous Materials Disclosure to the City of Orange Fire Department in order to coordinate with the local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that, in an event of an emergency, they are properly prepared and have knowl"

In the unlikely event of a release of a regulated chemical, no regulated chemical will reach any sensitive receptors.  At this point, the FXI, INC. facility has not identified any safety-related improvements to be made."
