Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at all OMF facilities.  The same management and maintenance personnel are responsible at all facilities for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent releases, and for responding to an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThe cold storage ammonia refrigeration system has safeties to detect both ammonia releases and unsafe operating conditions.  These are tied into an alarm system that is monitored 24 hours per day.  There are also portable refrigeration-units onsite that have no detection because the units are outdoors.  Operators are present to monitor the operating conditions of these units when they are running.  There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs and the maintenance program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE DESCRIPTION\n\nAt the Castroville facility, ammonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage, produce precooling, and ice generation.  The cold storage refrigeration system is a fixed system attached to the building.  The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer mounted and used for ice generation and for precooling of produce.

      "SummaryText": "SE SCENARIOS\n\nBoth a worse case and an alternate case release scenario were modeled for this RMP/PSM utilizing a computer-modeling program.  The worse case was a release of the entire ammonia charge of the largest system in 10 minutes with ambient conditions as required by EPA regulations.  This release was updated for the increased ammonia charge because of the addition.  The alternate was a release for 25 minutes averaging approximately 100 LBS/minute.  This is a more probable release due to items such as rotating seals, pressure relief valves, leaks in piping, charging system or draining oil.  The modeling software used was ?A Real Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres? (ALOHA) from the National Safety Council in cooperation with the EPA.  Both scenarios were considered releases in a rural setting.  Release plumes were plotted on maps, which showed the location of populations, schools, public areas, and acute care facilities if effected by the release.  The mapping software utilized was ?Mapping Application for Response and Planning of Local Operational Tasks? (MARPLOT) also from the National Security Council.  Effected populations were estimated using ?Land View V,? a computer census modeling program from the Bureau of Census that calculates census data of areas defined on MARPLOT generated maps.  The effected populations were updated for both scenarios utilizing the year 2000 population data. \n\nThere are various measures in place to limit the endpoint distances of a release.  One is an ammonia monitoring system providing early detection for the cold storage system.  Relief valves for all equipment except one portable unit are tied into diffuser water tanks rather than piped to ambient.  The cold storage system has an emergency control box for manual pressure release, which is also tied into a diffuser tank.  Preventive maintenance and safety inspections are used to insure equipment and piping is maintained and operating in a safe manner.\n\nGENERAL RELEASE PREVENTIO"

      "SummaryText": "N PROGRAM\n\nOMF maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment, logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  A program to document releases and analyze ways to prevent a similar future releases is in place.  A Risk Management Program, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained on-site along with this RMP/PSM. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the equipment room for the cold storage system that would shut down both the system and the ammonia flow.  The cold storage refrigeration system is monitored by an alarm and detection system for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day.  An emergency control box, tied into a water diffuser tank, allows system pressure to be relieved without releasing to ambient.  Relief valves for the cold storage and portable ice generators are also tied into this diffuser tank.  Two of the portable vacuum cooling systems have their relief valves tied into a separate diffuser tank.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents at this facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary, and for coordination with community emergen"
