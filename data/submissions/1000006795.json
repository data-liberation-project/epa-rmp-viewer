The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in these systems meets the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) threshold reporting quantity.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  Our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nPilgrims Pride CorporationA?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\nA? Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration department personnel\nA? Preventative maintenance program\nA? Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration department personnel\nA? Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\nA? Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\nA? Procedure for handling all changes to the system\nA? Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\nA? Regular review and update of process safety information\nA? Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\nA? On site HAZMAT team\nA? Emergency Response and Action Plan\nA?
