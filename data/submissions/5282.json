              "Description": "This Prevention Program incorporates, by this reference, the OHSA PSM program titled \"Process Safety Management.\" Nelco recognizes the difference between the two programs. That is, EPA's mandate is protection of the general public while OSHA's is protection of employee safety and health. In other words, EPA's authority is offsite, while OSHA's in onsite. As a practical matter, at Nelco, the two programs dovetail well. That is, measures described to prevent accidents that could expose employees to ammonia would also prevent a release that could have effects offsite. Differences exist in terminolgy and regulatory references. These differences are set forth in the Prevention Program document.",

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our emergency response procedure and to notify the Tempe Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Emergency evacualtion in the community would be coordinated through the Tempe Fire Department.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED. \n\nThis facility is a printed circuit board manufacturing facility using chlorine as a reagent in the etching process.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 6,000 pound tank of chlorine gas causing a release of all contents over a ten-minute period. According to EPA's RMPComp model, the distance to the endpoint is 1.6 miles. A portion of the City of Tempe, including schools, residences, hospitals and major commercial, office and industrial areas are within the endpoint distance.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rules, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or shelterings in place.\n\nDue to process fluxuations, indoor chlorine levels occasionally exceed OSHA PEL levels. This results in temporary evacuations of the building. No chlorine incidents have ever resulted in any off-site evacuations.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our chlorine system, it is our policy to initiate the plant emergency response procedure, including notification of the Tempe Fire Department to request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have insp"
