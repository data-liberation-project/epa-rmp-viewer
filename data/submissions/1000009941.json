BTQCL - Escalon Cellars, located on Highway 120 in Escalon, California is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for its employees, as well as protecting the local community and the environment from chemical releases.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES / PURPOSE: BTQCL - Escalon Cellars has developed an accidental release prevention program for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, and flammable chemicals. Through review and analysis of the following elements, BTQCL-Escalon Cellars has examined methods to reduce the likelihood that employees or the community may be exposed to hazardous chemicals due to catastrophic release:\n\nElement 1: Hazardous Chemical Process Review - examined the hazardous chemicals employed, mechanical systems' integrity and design, employee training, standard operating procedures, and auditing and inspection techniques employed. \n\nElement 2: Hazard Analysis Techniques - examined the potential hazards present, consequences of the failure of engineering controls, human factors, and failure siting. The Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) technique was chosen and employed for this purpose. \n\nElement 3: Review of Past Accidental Releases and Consequences.\n\nElement 4: Off-site Hazard Assessment - determined the off-site impacts of release based on worst-case and alternative release scenario analyses. The vulnerable zones for the release covered by highly hazardous chemicals were estimated using a computer assisted air dispersion modeling program.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES: Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements are typically triggered by manufacturing, handling, using, storing, processing, or on-site movement of certain quantities (referred to as threshold quantities) of chemicals deemed as hazardous. At the BTQC-Escalon Cellars facility, anhydrous am"

The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 54,000 pounds.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: Through hazard analysis techniques, BTQC-Escalon Cellars has updated and refined its standard operating procedures and process and instrumentation diagrams for all covered processes under RMP requirements. This information has been employed for providing more comprehensive training and a better understanding by operators.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: An investigation into the facilityA?s accident history showed that there have been no releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide that exceeded the federal reportable quantities during the five year accident period: June 2004 A? June 2009.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE MEASURES: BTQCL-Escalon Cellar's Emergency Planning and Response Program is included in the winery's Hazardous Materials Management Plan and Injury and Illness Prevention Plan.\n\nFor emergency release of hazardous materials, employees have been instructed to evacuate the area and notify their supervisor. The supervisor will assess the situation and notify the local fire department to respond, if warranted. \n\nThe local fire department can contact the Ripon HAZMAT Team to respond to hazardous material releases in a safe and timely manner. The local fire department is invited to tour the winery's hazardous material storage areas.\n\nEmployees are notified to evacuate by: 1) winery siren, 2) verbal instructions, and/or 3) two-way radio communication.\n\nIt is primarily the Cellar Manager's responsibility to make the proper notifications in case of an emergency release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, performed on May 15, 2009, generat"

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  BTQCL safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
