This commitment is demonstrated vy the resourcecs invested in accident prevention, such as trainign personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintnance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseable releaseas of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, or trained personnel will respond t control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders.\nB)  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility; located 8 miles north and 2.5 miles east of Kit Carson Co.; incorporates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility handles methane; ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables.  It processes approximately 10 million cubic feet of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Fcility does not use, process or storae a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\nC)  Hazard Assessment Results\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosio involving the full inventory of the larges process vessel containing 169,828 pounds or propane, ethane mix.  The maximum distance to the 1psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.450 miles.  No passive mitigation measure were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\nD)  Five Year Accident History\nwithin the past five years the processes have not had an accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemmical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe folliwng is a summar"

Although processes at  the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, they are not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses only generla safety issues and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\nI)  Safe Work Practices\nThe Mount Pealr Gas Inejction Facility has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: lockout/tagout to ensur isolataion of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before procecss piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark producing activiites (i.e. hot work), a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\nII)  Incident Investigation - The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire, explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and deevelop corrective actions to prevent a recurrent of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigator documents his/her findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwrads these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions tkaen in response to the investigation teams' findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finidn gor recommendation is documented, and the investigation results ar ereviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could"

Compliance audits are conducted approximately every 3 years.  Corrective actions taken in response to to the audt team's findings are tracked until they are complete and a final resolution of each finding is documemted and the two most recent audit reports retained.\nIV)  Summary of Proess Hazards, Safety Feature, and Hazard Analysis Findings - The process at the Mount Pearl Gas Inejction Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations.\nA) Universal Prevention Activities - The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP covered processes at the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility.  Collectively, these preventions program activities help prvent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\nB)  Specialized Safety Features - The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\nc)  Releasse Detection - Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in all closed compressor buildings.\nD) Release Containment/Control - 1) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated), 2) automated shudown systems for specific process parameter (e.g. high level, high temperature, high pressure), 3) Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases, 4) Atmospheric relief devices.\nE) Release Mitigation -  1) Personal protective equipment, 2) Trained emergency first responder personnel, 3) Spacing of equipment in accordance with IRI spacing guideline, 4)"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, incljiding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspeects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notificationof local emergency response agencies and the public f a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures. The emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes to the the emergency response program are identified and affected personnel are informed of the changes.  The overall emergency response program for the Moutn Pearl Gas Injection Facility is coordinated with the Kit Carson Fire Department and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings wit the LEPC, which incljuedes local emergency reponse officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.\nCertification:\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the wost case accidental release scenario for the following process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.
