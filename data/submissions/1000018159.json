Sargento Foods/Portionables occupies about 43,000 square feet of the building that is situated between North Derby Drive and I-29. The ammonia refrigeration system is owned by Nelson Engineering and is operated by Portionables/Sargento Foods. The ammonia system was designed and installed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards and codes, the American National standards Institute design criteria, and the American Society of heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers standards for mechanical refrigeration systems. The system is a two-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The facility is equipped with an alarm and ammonia detection systems and an off-site 24-hour, 365-day per year monitoring system.\n\nSargento Foods/Portionables is committed to protecting the health and well being of their employees, the environment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees, annual emergency response training and ammonia system training for maintenance personnel. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits are required. \n\nSargento Foods/Portionables has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage or sheltering in place. If an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified and the emergency response procedures would be followed. Sargento Foods/Portionables also has retained AC&R Specialists (Sioux City, Iowa) to respond to a release or emergency situation. The facilit"

The response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis. The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been trained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response personnel. Training and maintenance schedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods/PortionablesA?North Sioux City, South Dakota facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods/Portionables has developed and implemented a PSM program for the facility, in conjunction with SargentoA?s involvement in operations in 2009.  The PSM will be audited every three years. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) will be conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The last PHA was conducted on December 9, 2008. The PHA showed that the facility appears to have an adequate number of safeguards and implied that the facility was safe. All PHA concerns are in the process of being addressed."
