      "SummaryText": " a.  The Town of Davie Water Utilities Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The Town of Davie Utilities Department is included in the Emergency Response Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The emergency response policy includes this plan, and procedures for evaluation and mitigating minor on-site releases.  The response policy is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb.  The Town of Davie System I (North) Water Treatment Plant includes a chlorination system, which serves to disinfect the water supply for the Town of Davie.  The system delivers chlorine from one-ton liquid chlorine containers through vacuum-type chlorinators.  Each vacuum-type chlorinator has a built-in automatic system shutdown in the event of a vacuum pipe leak, thereby minimizing the amount of chlorine released to the atmosphere.  Pressurized lines of the system are limited to flexible connections (pigtails) on the one-ton containers and a short run of carbon steel piping.  The chlorination system is housed in a chlorination room and an instrument room, and includes a flow meter, electrical panels, and safety equipment.  A total of six, one-ton containers of chlorine may be on-site at any one time: however, only two, one-ton containers are on-line at any one time.  A utility shift supervisor and an operator typically are responsible for all plant operations.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day. 365 days per year.  \n\nc.  The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:  \n\n?  High level of training of the operators\n?  Preventative maintenance program\n?  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n?  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the part"

Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the following:  use of vacuum-type chlorinators and vacuum piping which provide automatic shut-down and minimize the amount of chlorine released in the vent of a vacuum pipe leak; operators make readily available both self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and personal emergency escape breathing apparatus during connection/ disconnection of chorine supply; operators are aware of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine; and, a chorine detector is located in the chlorination room.  \n\nd.  No accidental releases of chorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years. \n\ne.  The facility is included in the Emergency Response Plan of District XI Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as prepared for the South Florida Regional Planning Council.  \n\nf.  Changes to improve safety have been recommended as a result of the hazard review, conducted as part of this RMP.  The chlorination system is being replaced with an on-site chlorine generation system."
