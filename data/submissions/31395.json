This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nMBPP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MBPP has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, MBPP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform MBPP personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, MBPP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  MBPP personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nMBPP conducts a PSSR and or uses a Safety Close-out Checklist for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information that is controlled by management of change (MOC).

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or the Safe Operating Committee will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nMBPP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMBPP promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a personal injury, gas release, fire/explosion, major property damage, or environmental loss.

In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, [ We further believe heritage Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.]\n\nThe ExxonMobil Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant (MBPP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  MBPP has participated in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 1996 when MBPP was awarded STAR certification. MBPP has re-certified as a STAR site in 1999 and in March of 2004. Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ExxonMobil Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant, located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, U.S.A., operates a Low Density and a High Density polyethylene tra"

MBPP does not have any RMP regulated toxics on site. MBPP has two covered processes within the Low Density train for the purposes of this plan. The HDPE Polyethylene train does not meet the minimum inventories for RMP covered flammables and is not part of this submission.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were done using the EPA supplied look up tables which have been incorporated into the computer program supplied by NOAA. This program is called RMPComp.  This program uses all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS (Texas Gulf Coast)\n\nMBPP is subject to external events, which may cause the release of hazardous materials.  MBPP is designed and operated in such a way as to minimize the probability and the impact of such events.  External events considered in the design and operation of the plant include, but are not limited to: security; temperature extremes; hurricanes; tornadoes; winds; precipitation & flooding; utility disruption.  \n\nOf particular interest is the hurricane susceptibility.  MBPP was built in early 1980's and designed to the best wind technology available at the time.  MBPP utilizes an Emergency Preparedness Plan with the latest weather tracking services to identify potential weather threats and take action to secure the plant days in advance of approaching storms.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MBPP.
