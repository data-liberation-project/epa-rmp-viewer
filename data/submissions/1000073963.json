Furthermore, the facility did not begin operations until January of 2011\r\n\r\nBecause chlorine storage is a Program 2 covered process, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.

To assist with ongoing compliance, a Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual have been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\r\n\r\nThis facility is a waste water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the waste water with two chlorine cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with the waste water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine by weight.  Waste water is additionally treated with sulphur dioxide, which is also a regulated substance. However, the sulphur dioxide stored on site  is below threshold quantities. The treated waste water is then released.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances \r\n\r\nThis facility has one worst case release scenario which involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest chlorine cylinder when full (2,000 lbs total).  This scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 3.0 miles.  Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for this scenario.\r\n\r\nThis facility has an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves a puncture of the largest diameter chlorine cylinder when full.  The scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 0.8 miles.  Section 3.2 of this RMP shows the calculations used for this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel without administrative controls or mitigation measures to limit the volume or reduce the d"
