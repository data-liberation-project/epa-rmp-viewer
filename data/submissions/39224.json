      "SummaryText": "The Town of Guilderland operates a water treatment facility which uses chlorine as a water disinfectant. The maximum quanity contained on site at one time is about 4,000 pounds of liquified gaseous chlorine. There are two containers each with a capacity of 2,000 lbs. One is in use and the other in storage. The threat of a release is most probable during transfer. Other incidents could occur due to faulty piping or fittings. There has been no significant release during the past five years. A chlorine safety program has been formulated at the facility and local emergency response units are aware of the potential of a chlorine leak into the atmosphere. The chemical is stored in an enclosed building and there are leak monitors and detectors in place."
