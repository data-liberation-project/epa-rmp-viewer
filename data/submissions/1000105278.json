In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/Smart Plan is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Niles Township Fire Department (primary responder) and the City of Niles Fire Department (mutual aid).\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Niles LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated follow-up actions, where appropriate. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the release of materials resulting in consequences covered under the EPA RMP reporting requirements.  The Terminal tracks all process safety incidents per API 754.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Niles LP Terminal is identified as a non-responding facility.  As previously noted, the Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Niles Township Fire Department (primary responder), the City of Niles Fire Department (mutual aid), and Berrien County Emergency Management. An ERAP/Smart Plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release or fire including implementation of emergency response notification procedures.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Niles (North) LP Terminal butane tank blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Niles Township Fire Department and request their assistance.\n\nThe Niles Township Fire Department participates in annual butane training sessions for this system.\n\nE.

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Tank Blending Process.\n\nThe Butane Tank Blending process is a batch-type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and piped directly to and injected into the gasoline recirculation lines associated with atmospheric storage tanks. Process safety controls for the offloading skid  that are used include emergency shutoff valves with a fusible element (rated at < 250 deg. F) with local and remote manual actuation; a check valve for instantaneous closure in the event of a pull-away event, and a Smart Hose with engineered breakaway capabilities plus self-closing valves at each connection point. Other protective measures/system controls include pipe thermal/hydrostatic reliefs and grounding devices. Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and approved contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Niles LP Terminal accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help Marathon effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substance to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment.
