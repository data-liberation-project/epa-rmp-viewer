The process uses a chemical called ammonia to refrigerate the warehouse.  There is at most 14,000 pounds of ammonia onsite at any one time, which is contained in seven tanks.  Michigan Cold Storage Facilities is aware of the hazards associated with using ammonia for refrigeration.  The hazard that poses the greatest threat to the community is an ammonia leak.  In order to control the hazard, regular inspections of the facility are performed.  The engineer on duty performing the inspection fills out an extensive checklist to ensure that the process is operating properly.  The Emergency Preparedness section of the Process Safety Management Program includes instructions for what to do in case of an emergency.  The program also includes safe work practices that will help reduce the risk associated with using and performing maintenance on large volumes of ammonia.  Emergency phone numbers are included in the program so that first responders can be informed of an emergency 24 hours a day.  Michigan Cold Storage has implemented a Risk Management Plan, which supplements the Process Safety Management Program.  The Risk Management Plan contains a worst case scenario and an alternative scenario.  The worst case scenario is used to predict the areas of the community that would be effected if the total volume of ammonia was to escape the storage vessels.  In the event of the worst case scenario, 1.58 square miles and approximately 4746 people would be at risk.  The alternative scenario is used to predict which areas of the community would be effected if a one-half inch diameter leak was to form in the refrigeration system.  If the alternative scenario was to occur, approximately .29 square miles and 198 people would be at risk.  By predicting what the outcome of these scenarios would be, Michigan Cold Storage will be more prepared to protec"
