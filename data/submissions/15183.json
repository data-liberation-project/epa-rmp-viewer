Our business has operated safely in San Diego for 70 years.\n\nPolicies\nOur accidental release prevention policies are based on investment in state-of-the-art chemical handling systems, and operating by OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The chemical handling systems, and our PSM program, are detailed later in this document.  Later this year Cal-OSHA will thoroughly review our PSM program, at our invitation, as part of our application for Cal-OSHA\u0012s Voluntary Protection Program Star certification.  Seeking this certification further demonstrates our continued commitment to the safety and health of employees and the surrounding community as well as to the protection of the environment.   \n\nOur approach to emergency response is based on developing on-site expertise,  to work in conjunction with community emergency service professionals. Our on-site Emergency Response Team (ERT) is comprised of volunteer employees with a wide variety of expertise from throughout the organization.  The team is well-trained and equipped to perform initial on-site containment and remediation of chemical releases.  Included in the team\u0012s training is detailed understanding of hazardous materials systems in our facility.  The team works according to an incident command system like that used by Fire Departments and other emergency response agencies.  The site has a 24-hour staffed emergency reporting telephone to assure rapid communication of any incident requiring immediate r"

Although we have never had a chemical release incident with community impact,  the Fire Department has the expertise and resources to assist the community with notification, shelter-in-place, evacuation or other community protection methods appropriate for a given situation.   \n\nRegulated Substances & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \nOur operation has two chemical processes regulated by the RMP, one using chlorine and the other using propylene oxide.  \n\nChlorine is a toxic gas with a sharp, irritating odor,  greenish-yellow in color.  We handle chlorine in cylinders constructed of 1 < thick steel plate.  Each cylinder contains about 165 gallons of chlorine, or one-ton.  Chlorine is used directly from the cylinders, with no other storage vessels.  The key safety components of our chlorine installation are a containment building, a continuous air monitor, a scrubber and a vacuum piping system.\n\nUpon arrival at the plant the chlorine cylinders are unstrapped from the delivery truck and moved a short distance using a dedicated overhead hoist into an adjacent chlorine containment building.   The containment building has a continuous air monitoring sensor and alarm.  If one part per million chlorine is detected inside the containment building, an audio alarm and a flashing light outside the building indicates chlorine is present.  If three parts per million chlorine is detected (a level safe for extended exposure), a building exhaust scrubber activates which captures the atmosphere of the containment building.  The scrubber is charged with liquid capable of absorbing and converting the full contents of one chlorine cylinder to stable sodium hypochlorite (common bleach) solution.  \n\nChlorine is drawn into our manufacturing process through individual vacu"

      "SummaryText": "um regulator valves mounted on each active cylinder.  Chlorine can only flow through the vacuum regulator valves if the process piping is under vacuum.  A vacuum eductor at each use point pulls chlorine through the piping.  Any  break or leak would cause the piping to lose vacuum, and the vacuum regulator valves would automatically shut off chlorine flow at the cylinders.  \n\nPropylene oxide is a liquid solvent whose vapors are toxic if inhaled, though much less toxic than chlorine.  Propylene oxide is delivered in sealed rail cars, and stored in two triple-contained underground storage tanks.  Some of the key safety features of the propylene oxide system are rail cars with all valving on the top of the car, vapor return lines to capture propylene oxide vapor, nitrogen blankets in the headspace of all storage tanks, triple-contained, state-of-the-art storage tank design, and continuous storage tank leak detection.    \n\nPropylene oxide is pumped from the top of the rail car to the underground storage tanks through welded steel piping that is inspected daily for leaks.  Nitrogen headspace pressure in the storage tanks, and in the rail car provides an atmosphere that does not support combustion, and that delivers propylene oxide into the production process. \n\nWorst Case Scenario\nModeling indicates that our worst case scenario release, as defined by the RMP regulations, would be the discharge of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine directly to the atmosphere, outside of our containment building,  within a 10 minute period, during worst-case nighttime air conditions.  This would be a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  In our operation, there is no known failure mechanism that could result in a release rate this high. According to EPA guidance, the downwind safe distance from this worst case scenario release is 1.3 miles.  The only time that chlorine cylinders are outside of the containment building is during biweekly delivery of chlorine cylinders to the site, which only o"

In 1995, we identified three release scenarios each for chlorine and propylene oxide for our California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  We believe the largest of these release scenarios are the appropriate ones to use for the RMP alternate scenarios.   \n\nFor chlorine, the alternate scenario release is failure of a cylinder outlet valve within our containment building, coincident failure of the air monitoring instrumentation, and assuming one hour to manually start the scrubber.  This scenario would result in a safe downwind distance of 427 feet, which would potentially affect our industrial neighbors only.  \n\nFor propylene oxide, the alternate scenario would be a spill of 200 gallons resulting from failure of a transfer hose during the unloading of a rail car.  This scenario would result in a safe downwind distance of 712 feet, which would potentially affect our industrial neighbors only.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\nIn addition to the installed chemical handling systems described above, our chemical release prevention system employs the full range of practices required by OSHA Process Safety Management. Our plant has been operating under PSM for over five years, and the program is now well developed.  Some  highlights include:\n\n\t-A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every 5 years or more frequently.  We use the Hazop (Hazard & Operability Study) method, because it is a very thorough and rigorous PHA system. This involves a team of experts who use a formal, defined system to review the hazards posed by the chemical,  and consider best industry practices for handling the material.  Recommendations for improvement are made and priorities set for implementing them.  We recently updated our PHA for propylene oxide, and identified a number of improvements.  Our last chlorine PHA was completed less than 4"

Included is a thorough Safety Procedures Manual, which was updated this year.  Training is provided before employees are allowed to operate critical equipment without direct oversight.\n\n\t-A documented Management of Change system controls modifications to equipment and operating parameters.  Each change is reviewed beforehand by appropriate personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\n\t-The site uses a number of contract personnel for a variety of services.  Our Contractor/Guest Safety Program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria.  Training and open communication is maintained with contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\nIn addition, we maintain a number of adjunct systems and equipment for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\n\n7 local and remote chlorine alarms to quickly respond to leaks,\n7 emergency chlorine cylinder repair kits,\n7 emergency response equipment including self-contained-breathing-apparatus,    personal protective gear, and air monitoring equipment, for use by the Emergency Response Team \n7 foam systems for controlling evaporation rates of spilled propylene oxide, and extinguishing propylene oxide fires.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe facility has never had a release of chlorine or propylene oxide that resulted in community injury or health impact in over 50 years of using these materials.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAll employees are trained to recognize potential emergenc"

Key Emergency Response Team personnel are available by pager.\n\nEach Emergency Response Team member receives 24 hours of initial specialized training, 8 hours of First Aid and CPR training, and 8 hours of refresher training annually.  Included are hands-on drills, and training about our site\u0012s specific hazardous material systems.  The Team is well equipped with protective gear and specialized emergency response equipment.  \n\nThe first Emergency Response Team member to arrive on the scene assumes the role of incident commander.  The Incident Commander assesses the scene, and develops a response plan.  The proper gear and team members are assembled, and take action.  If a more qualified responder arrives, like the Fire Department, the Incident Commander will relinquish command. \n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\nThe CalARP process has caused us to look more closely at our propylene oxide handling methods.  We identified a beneficial improvement, now in design, of adding a spring-loaded fail-close valve directly on the rail car before the transfer hose is installed.   This would enable an operator to quickly and remotely shut-off propylene oxide flow in the event of a transfer hose leak.  \n\nWe also invited the San Diego City Fire Department\u0012s Hazmat Coordinator to review both our propylene oxide system and our chlorine system, and make recommendations.  He recommended verifying the functionality of our foam system for controlling propylene oxide emissions.  A foam drill is now in planning stages.  Regarding our chlorine system, he found no improvements needed, and commented that our installed release response capture system was better than anything the Fire Department could provide.\n\nAnother safety improvement arising from CalARP is an improve"
