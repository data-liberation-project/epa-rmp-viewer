It also has training sessions for all employees engaged in the transfer of product and the repair of this facility.\r\n\r\nWe feel that through careful inspection and maintenance with trained employees we can prevent nearly all accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at this plant.  This plant is engaged in the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia to be used as a nitrogen fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nThe worst case release would be the rupture of our largest vessel, a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing approximately 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Using RMP Comp.as a model, this would give a toxic endpoint of 6.9 miles possibly affecting 16,000 people depeding on weed speed and direction.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release, again using RMP Comp., would be the rupture of piping results from a transport driving away before disconnecting the delivery hose.  This release would last approximately 10 minutes resulting in the release of approximately 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia having an endpoint of .9 miles and possibly affecting 2700 people depending on wind speed and direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth alternative releases should be stopped by automatic excess flow valves installed in the piping system.\r\n\r\nConsumers Oil Company is regulated by the Missouri Department of Agriculture and also conducts its own inspections of plant, tanks, piping, and hoses used in the transfer and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  All employees involved in the storage, transfer, and repair of the facilities are also trained in the proper and safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThis plant has no five year accident history to report.  We believe this confirms the success of our maintenance and training procedures.\r\n\r\nConsumers Oil Company policy to an emergency is if the situation can be quickly and safely handled"
