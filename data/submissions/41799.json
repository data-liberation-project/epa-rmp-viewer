Change of SIC code to new system.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nThe Fairfax County Water Authority (FCWA) occupies approximately 20 acres in southern Fairfax County at the Lorton Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The Lorton WTP is located on Ox Road, approximately 1 mile north of Interstate 95. \r\n\r\nThe Lorton WTP is a drinking water provider and has an average capacity of 52 million gallons of drinking water a day.   Operations at the Lorton WTP fall into the 22131 Standard Industrial Classification.\r\n\r\nAt the Lorton WTP, the FCWA pumps, treats and distributes water from the Occoquan River Reservoir to customers in the Northern Virginia Region.  To ensure the highest quality drinking water is available to its customers, the FCWA uses chlorine as a disinfectant to remove and control the growth of otherwise potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens in the drinking water supply.  Because of its relative toxicity, chlorine is listed as a regulated substances under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  Under the provisions, EPA requires that facilities having regulated chemical processes above the following threshold implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) covering the regulated process.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nChemical\tThreshold Quantity\r\n\r\n\tChlorine\t2,500 pounds\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to the facility in one (1) ton containers via tractor trailer.

Moreover, the RMP describes the FCWA's procedures to minimize the risk and prevent unwanted releases of the chemical into the surrounding communities.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\n\r\nThe FCWA has adopted policies that comply with applicable federal, state, local, and institutional regulations for design, construction,  operation, and modification of the water treatment plant facilities.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Chlorine\r\n\r\nWhile chlorine releases are rare at WTPs, the FCWA has conducted an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to evaluate the potential impacts on the surrounding \r\ncommunities should an unwanted release occur.  As directed by EPA regulations, the FCWA assumed a worst-case release scenario to consist of a 1-ton cylinder depleting its contents over a 10 minute release period.  Such a chlorine release would tend to sink, hug the ground, or follow low lying areas due to the fact that chlorine is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air.  Depending on the ambient weather conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) and the topography of the surrounding land, the chemical plume can impact the surrounding region and cause damage to human health and the environment.    \r\n\r\nTo determine how far from the Lorton WTP a chlorine plume would travel from a 1-ton cylinder over a 10 minute release period, the FCWA utilized RMP Comp version 1.07.  Additionally, the FCWA utilized the Fairfax Joint Local Emergency Planning Committee's (FJLEPC) modeling conducted consistent with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  These approaches conservatively estimate a potential impact area that is circular with the center being the point of release.\r\n\r\nFor the Lorton WTP, the greatest mass that can be released from any chlorine pro"

Due to the stability of the regulated process over 30+ years and no historical  process incidents, a checklist method with a what-if analysis was chosen for the PHA.  Copies of the completed PHA's and checklist are maintained as a part of the aforemented safety information.  The FCWA will review and update the PHA's at least every five years or after any significant modification or change to the chlorine system at the WTP.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nDetailed operating procedures for the chlorine system have been  developed.  The procedures are detailed step-by-step instructions for safely performing operations on the chlorine system in a manner to minimize the risk of an accidental release.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure up-to-date operating procedures, the FCWA will review and update the PHA's at least every five years or after any significant modification or change to the chlorine system at the WTP. At the time of this update, no process modifications have occurred in the five years to trigger a review or update.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAll employees who work with the chlorine system at the Lorton WTP have received on the job training of the processes and their hazards.

The potential impact area is shown on Figure 1. \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 2,500 people live within the boundaries of the potential impact area as identified on Figure 1.  Moreover, the potential impact area contains both public and environmental receptors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC FILE DELETED\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario - Chlorine\r\n\r\nConsidering that the aforementioned worst-case release scenario is ultra-conservative and unrealistic in terms of the potential impact area, the FCWA is required to conduct an alternate release scenario for chlorine. This variation of the worst-case scenario is considered more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  The impact area must still include off-site receptors.  However, it is important to understand that although the occurrence of the alternate release scenario is considered as more realistic, the FCWA considers it still to be highly unlikely due to engineering and administrative controls at the Lorton WTP.   \r\n\r\nEPA regulations encourage facilities to select the alternate release scenario from one that has occurred at some point in the past at the facility or from one identified through the process hazards analysis.  Due to no historical off-site releases at the Lorton WTP within the last 25 years, the alternate release scenario selected, although still unlikely, was one identified through the process hazard analysis.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, the alternate release assumed that the largest vessel of chlorine (1-ton cylinder) is released. \r\n\r\n\tFigure 1 presents the alternate case release scenario  estimating a 0.1 mile radius which would not travel to an offsite receptor or affect residential populations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n \r\nThe EPA RMP regulations require each regulated facility to report all accidental releases which resulted in deaths, injury, environmental"

The tiers are established as Program 1, Program 2 and Program 3.  As a rule of thumb, since the FCWA's off-site consequence analysis affected off-site receptors, the FCWA falls into the Program 3 tier requirement.   Moreover, the WTP is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety therefore making compliance with Program 3 criteria mandatory under the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nThe FCWA has established a management system to assign responsibility for the development, implementation, and modification of the RMP.  The overall responsibility for implementation is assigned to the Manager of Water Production, with specific responsibilities assigned to management level personnel with organizational responsibility for the individual tasks (i.e. plant maintenance).\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe FCWA maintains up-to-date process safety information on the chlorine and  processes at the Lorton WTP.

A checklist procedure will used by an audit team to conduct compliance inspections  at FCWA facilities for all regulated programs and processes. \r\n\r\nThe FCWA Risk Manager will then prepare an audit report documenting all findings, recommended corrective action, assigned personnel, and completion dates.

The purpose of the investigation is to identify any underlying causes and facts leading up to and contributing to the incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe FCWA"
