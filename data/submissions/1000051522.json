This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nCIE has emergency policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP); Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC); that outline procedures for how CIE handles spills. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on how CIE responds to emergencies prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. These Plans also detail best management practice in place at the facility, i.e. good housekeeping, prompt routine equipment maintenance and inspections.\n\n\n\nCIE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for CIE is Mark Sevier, QA Manager of CIE. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are below:\n\n\n\nRyan Drook, Chief Operating Officer\n\nWork: (765) 384-4001\n\n24-hour: (917) 957-9027\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nCIE ethanol plant is located in "

      "SummaryText": "Marion, Grant County, Indiana. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn and high grade ethanol. The regulated substance stored at the facility is anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia: Anhydrous Ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank. The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, creating a vapor cloud. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; 5.6 miles radius. It is assumed passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. The towns of Marion and Sweetser, Pipe Creek, Boots Creek, Cart Creek, Sims Franklin Ditch, Sweeters Ditch, Woods Ditch, Stoney Creek, Lomax Ditch, Lloyd Ditch are within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank. The located is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.7 mile radius. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e."

      "SummaryText": " schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility and the excess flow valve has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; 0.5 miles radius.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were <0.1 miles and are provided as part of this documentation. Publi"

Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports per IDEM requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with the RMP covered process at the CIE facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nCIE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate actions taken by CIE if a scenario should occur, including a Health and Safety. CIE responds by calling the local authorities and has several spill response kits onsite. As mentioned, an Industrial SWPPP, and SPCC have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nCIE provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis. Any changes to improve safety will be implemented immediately upon discovery of needed changes.\n\n\n\n"
