The address is 309 American Circle, El Dorado, Union County, Arkansas.  The general commercial function of the facility is to thermally treat (incinerate) hazardous and non-regulated materials and render the incinerator residues acceptable for disposal at regulated Subtitle C landfills.  The facility also acts as a transfer station for wastes not amenable to thermal treatment.\nTeris\u00bf Incineration facility is operated by the Teris Staff.  The Facility has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold, because of the highly variable nature of the chemicals received, Teris will use predictive filing for the RMP.  Teris has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to this Facility.  Teris Incineration facility operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nTeris LLC has a management system in place which is lead by the Teris Vice President of Operations, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the Facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the Facility\u00bfs RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nTeris LLC maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  This program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-Pevention elements that are like the elements of the in-place OSHA PSM program.  RMP also has unique elements as: a management system, off-site hazards assessment, and RMP Plan submittal.  Teris maintains these and all of the ISO 9000 and 14000 polices and procedures in the Facility\u00bfs documen"

Teris also employs contractors and consultants for specialized tasks.\nThe site is owned and operated by Teris LLC.  The facility receives hazardous wastes in many forms and container sizes.  The facility receives small containerized lab packs, 55 gallon drums, and totes.  The facility also receives bulk chemicals in over the road trailer vans as well as rail tankers and solids in roll off containers.\nThe boundaries of the RMP chemical process areas include five processes;\n1.)\tWarehouse receiving and storage of containerized materials,\n2.)\tBulk liquid receiving, storage, and feed to the incinerator system,\n3.)\tDirect Burn of both tankers and cylinders to the incinerator system,\n4.)\tSpecial handling Facility where materials are repacked for incineration.  This process also includes separate storage buildings for oxidizers as well as separate storage buildings for water reactive material, and\n5.)\tIncinerator staging and feed system includes direct drum drops, auger shredders and direct drum pumping to the incineration system.\nThe boundary of the RMP process ends as the  waste materials combust within the rotary kiln and the secondary combustion chamber.\nEvery chemical received, stored, transferred and incinerated on site goes through at least two of the above processes.  Several chemicals can be processed through each of the five processes.  These processes are detailed in the Piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) and simplified block flow diagrams which are part of the Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the Facilities RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.1.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\nTeris receives thousands of chemicals and waste streams.

Teris staff uses a computerized inventory control system to track each RMP (and PSM) chemical.  The predictive filing inventory lists 25 RMP chemicals.  Of these, eight are flammable and 17 are toxic.  Prior to acceptance of another RMP listed chemicals above its threshold quantity, a revised RMP Plan will be submitted.  The following table of RMP chemicals includes their maximum intended inventory based on predictive filing. \n\n \nTABLE OF CHEMICALS AND MAXIMUM EXPECTED INVENTORY\n \n\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the potential effects a release could have on the public and environment.  For toxic chemicals, the distance to the endpoint concentration the gas could travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of Chemicals was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment was conducted for each flammable and each toxic chemical.  Based on the results, two scenarios, a worst case flammable and a worst case toxic events were chosen.  Also, an alternative case scenario was conducted for each of the 25 chemicals.\nThe offsite consequence analyses conducted included two worst chemical release case scenarios.  The first is a \u00bfworst case flammable release\u00bf.  The second is a worst case toxic release scenario\u00bf.  Both scenarios are defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released within 10 minutes\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  Teris also conducted offsite consequence analysis for alternative case scenarios.  These were based on plant experience and our recent and past process hazards analysis.  \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using RMP Comp to determine the distance traveled by the chemicals released before the concentration"

There are two parts to the program.  The first is the plant wide program.  The second is the chemicals-specific actions within the site program.  Teris has a well trained employee Fire Brigade, Emergency Response (HAZMAT) Team, Confined Space Rescue Team, and Medical First Aid Team.  We can use the City of El Dorado\u00bfs fire department for fire fighting back-up. \n3.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\nThe facility-wide prevention program is used for all operations.  An overview of the prevention program is listed below:\nTeris LLC has detailed process safety information on each of its operations this includes MSDS as well as waste profiles, equipment manuals, P&IDs, etc. \nDetailed operating procedures are kept in a document maintenance system, QSI.  QSI is integral into the management of change for all operations on site.  Teris is an ISO 9000 and 14000 registered facility.  \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used, or handled. \nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \nIncident investigations of accidents ensure learning from each event as well as correct the root cause(s) of the incident. \nEmployees participate in all aspects of the development and implementation of our health, safety and environmental programs.  Employees participate in the safety committee, emergency response teams, process hazards analysis teams, procedure writing and safety check program.  All PSI is available to employees. \nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock-Out Tag-Out Permits, 3) Vessel Ent"

Both the EPA and an independent environmental firm, determined there were no off site environmental impacts.  There were no on or off site injuries or deaths related to the incident.  Based on the investigation results Teris installed separate fire safe buildings for oxidizers (the chemical which initiated the fire) and separate buildings for water reactive chemicals.  Review of the inventory determined only one RMP chemical, methyl chloride, was present in the warehouse above the RMP threshold quantity.\n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Facility Emergency Response Policy Contingency Plan and are coordinated with the Union County LEPC as well as the El Dorado Fire Department.  The plan includes an emergency response \u00bfdecision tree\u00bf and a notification plan.  The Facility also has site specific emergency actions defined in the Facilities operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and evacuation drills are conducted at least annually by the safety department for each of the operating departments\u00bf personnel.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.  \nTeris has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38) that includes provisions to evacuate employees, contractors and visitors from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical.  Teris is also subject to OSHA\u00bfs Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Plan regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).  Teris has developed and implemented a HAZWOPER program that includes on-site emergency responders, on-site fire brigade, fixed and mobile fire protection equipment, and fire and vapor suppression chemicals.  Training on the HAZWOPER program is conducted on annual basis to ensure employees are properly trained and ready to respond to a chemical emergency.    \n\nIn the event of an uncontrolled"
