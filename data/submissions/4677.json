      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances-77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases-and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\n\nThe Bachman Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is well above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Bachman WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) Plan that contains the following required information:\n\n7 Management System\n\n7 A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B).\n\n7 A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C)\n\n7 An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E)\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Bachman WTP.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Bachman WTP facility in Dallas, Texas has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.  This facility is implementing a "

      "SummaryText": "program for on-site emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff is receiving training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of the City of Dallas HAZMAT team.  \n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Bachman WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The Bachman WTP regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 205 tons of chlorine at its facility that is stored in two DOT certified 90-ton rail cars, and one 25-ton emergency storage tank.  This is above the threshold limit (2,500 pounds) set by the USEPA. \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Bachman WTP receives raw water from Lake Grapevine, Lake Lewisville, and Lake Ray Roberts by way of the Trinity River, into the treatment plant located at 2605 Shorecrest Drive in Dallas, Texas.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  \n\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the Bachman WTP consists of  (1) inside storage tanks (two 90-ton rail cars and one 25-ton emergency tank), (2) liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, (3) two evaporators, (4) gas piping and miscellaneous valves, (5) four chlorinators, and (6) one scrubber system.  On treatment plant grounds, the two areas in which chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release are the chlorine storage area (items 1 and 2 above) and the chlorine process areas (items 3 through 6 above). \n\nChlorine is mostly delivered to the Bachman WTP by railroad on rail spurs and stored in two 90-ton railroad tank cars, located at the Chlorine and Ammonia Building. The emergency tank is filled through a chlorine tanker truck when necessary.  Chlorine is removed as a liquid "

      "SummaryText": "under pressure of the rail car or the emergency tank.  Chlorine is withdrawn from one tank car at a time through a flexible metal connection.  As the supply in one rail car empties, the supply is manually switched to the full tank car. The emergency tank is used only when there is no chlorine in either of the rail cars, which is a rare occurrence.\n\nThe chlorine is pumped through a flexible reinforced hose and hard-piped to two chlorine evaporators located in the chlorine evaporator room. The chlorine gas generated by the evaporator is then transferred to the chlorinators.  The chlorine gas is then mixed into solution and is fed either to rapid mix basins, secondary basins, or at the filter outlet.   \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe chlorine storage and process areas have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the off-site population and environment.  The U.S. EPA requires that one worst-case scenario and one alternate release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe largest potential release of chlorine would occur through an angle valve failure on the 90-ton rail car located on the north side of the plant.  This valve failure could potentially release all 90 tons of the chlorine as a gas.  Under Section 68.25(c)(1), the release time for a chemical such as chlorine is 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls were applicable to the worst-case release at this plant.\n \nThe EPA-approved modeling program DEGADIS+ was used to characterize the effects of the worst case scenario at the Bachman facility.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 5.65 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 230,000 people.  Commercial / industrial areas and residential areas would be affected in the worst-case release scenario.\n \nAlternate Scenario\n\nOne alternate scenario was modeled for the Bachman WTP, which did not have any active or passive mitigation.  The scenari"

It was assumed that this leak could occur for 120 minutes, the time between operator rounds, creating a release rate of 30 lb/min. DEGADIS+ was used to characterize the effects of the alternative case scenario at the Bachman WTP.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 0.54 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 340 people.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PRECAUTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Bachman WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment utilizing only fully trained personnel in this area.  Bachman WTP management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Bachman WTP's accident history was reviewed for a period from June 1994, through June 1999.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are five in-plant contacts for an emergency, the Operations Supervisor, and the Shift Supervisors.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary response personnel cannot be contacted.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training underway.\n\nThe City of Dallas HAZMAT team has been designated to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment, and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plan's emergency call. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for chlorine a list of action items was developed and is b"

      "SummaryText": "eing considered by Bachman WTP management to determine if implementation is to be accomplished.  The most notable planned changes include the following:\n\n7 Standard procedure has the railroad leave the car on-site and then Bachman personnel move the rail cars into the building when necessary.  The cars are usually left alone until they are moved.  Bachman personnel are going to consider implementing a SOP that will be developed with MW to require inspection once the car is spotted on site.  This would reduce the uncertainty of an uninspected on-site rail car. \n\n7 The consideration of outside leak detection is tied to the periodic need for railcars containing chlorine to be stored on site with some cars inside the Chlorine and Ammonia Building and others (up to two) situated outside of the Chlorine and Ammonia Building.  This situation arises periodically and is tied to the inefficient delivery from the railroad (the plant has waited as long as 45 days in the past to receive a rail car of chlorine).  Given that these extra cars were spotted outside, the installation of a leak detection system should ensure that the leaks would be detected."
