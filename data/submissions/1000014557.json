Robins has specialized is serving the unique chemical needs of the Midwest.  The company is involved with basic commodity distribution, transloading, custom blending, high quality distribution, custom packaging, and dry product particle size modification.  All blending, transloading, packaging and product size modifications take place at this Home Office facility and two branch locations in East St. Louis.\n\nG.S. Robins and Company is a long time member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  Through the NACD, G.S. Robins has committed and pledged to constantly improve the management and handling of chemicals by following NACD's Responsible Distribution Process (RDP).  RDP is a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety, and environmental performance of all member companies.  G.S. Robins' implementation of the RDP includes a commitment to comply with relevant environmental, health and safety regulations.  The senior management at G.S. Robins has formally accepted these guiding principles.\n\nRDP includes guiding principles for all aspects of EHS.  These include:  communication with emergency response officials, operating our facilities in a safe manner, responding to community concerns about chemicals, and to make EHS a priority.  In order to verify that G.S. Robins has complied with the guiding principles of RDP, the NACD conducts a third party verification.\n\nThe primary activities at the St. Louis facility consist of the following:  bulk chemical repackaging, drum and IBC storage, transloading, and custom blending.  G.S. Robins has two RMP chemicals at or above the threshold value.  These chemicals are anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for G.S. Robins involves Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is brought on-site in a DOT certified bulk transpo"

The worst-case scenario demonstrates all of the Anhydrous Ammonia in the truck being released at one time before we convert to Aqua Ammonia.  The maximum amount brought in by truck is 42,000 pounds.  The scenario would be either a hose rupture or piping failure.  The scenario has a Toxic Endpoint of 1.1 miles (offsite impact radius).  The modeling was done using the EPA COMP program.  The likelihood of this scenario taking place is remote.\n\nThe alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins consist of problems that are more likely to happen.  As a chemical distributor, we move a large quantity of chemicals.  During the moving or storage of a chemical there is a chance that a container could begin leaking.  The leaking could be caused by several factors.  These factors include: overfilling, mishandling, jostling during transportation or just a leak.  The following are the alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins.  These alternative scenarios were completed on the EPA COMP modeling program.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR OUTDOOR CHEMICAL STORAGE\nThe outdoor chemical storage consists of storage of tanks, totes or drums.  The on-site storage tank is used to store bulk Aqua Ammonia to fill drums and totes. The Alternative Scenarios represent incidents that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  G.S. Robins moves a large amount of material through the facility each year.  The types of incidents that are likely to occur are:  drum leaks, tote leaks, and leaks in tote valves.\nRelease of Aqua Ammonia from a 240,000 lb tank /Toxic Endpoint = .7 miles\nRelease of anhydrous ammonia from a 42,000 lb tank truck/Leak in connections, hose or truck/ Toxic Endpoint = 0.6 miles\nRelease of aqua ammonia from a 2200 lb tote/Leak in the tote/Toxic Endpoint = 0.1 mile\n\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR INDOOR CHEMICAL STORAGE\n(All scenarios below are released in an enclosed space, in"
