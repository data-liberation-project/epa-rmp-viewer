Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. (MarkWest) - Siloam facility located in South Shore, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Greenup County, Kentucky and Scioto County, Ohio Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses processing, storage, and wholesale distribution of various liquified petroleum gases (LPGs).  The following LPGs are present at the facility: propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes), and mixed feed natural gas liquids (a combination of all the previously mentioned LPGs commonly referred to as Y-grade).  All of these substances are regulated due to their flammable and explosive nature.  \n\nThe facility receives the mixed feed Y-grade from pipeline, tank truck, and rail car.  The Y-grade is stored in above ground vessels and then processed at the facility into propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline.  These products are stored in both above ground vessels and also, in the case of propane and normal butane, in underground caverns.\n\nThese products are then distributed from the facility by tank truck, rail car, and, in the case of normal butane, isobutane, and natural ga"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the underground propane storage cavern.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the cavern, approximately 8.2 million gallons (34.44 million pounds) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour), the maximum distance of 2.63 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure. \n\nUtilizing Landview III and Marplot software, the worst case scenario radius of 2.63 miles is illustrated in the graphic file \"siloamwc.jpg\" (electronic version) and in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).  Major industrial facilities located within this radius include North American Refractories, New Boston Coke, and OSCO Industries.  Residential areas located within the radius include South Shore, Kentucky, New Boston, Ohio, and portions of Portsmouth and Sciotoville, Ohio.  Based on Landview III 1990 census data utilizing the block group proration method, 2,544 households and 6,353 people are located within the 2.63 mile radius.  Finally, eight schools are located within the 2.63 mile radius: Mckinley Middle, Highland Elementary, Wilson Elementary, Oak Street Elementary, Glenwood High, Stanton Elementary, Mckell Middle, and Mckell Elementary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from one of the vessels in the propane storage process.

The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 51,936 gallons (218,132 lbs) of propane (this quantity is 90% of the entire available capacity of the vessel).  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral weather conditions (wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour), the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \n\nThe alternative case scenario radius of 0.3 miles is illustrated in the attached map (provided in non-electronic versions only).  No major industrial or residential areas are located within this radius.  No schools are located in this area.  The radius of effect of this alternative release scenario would remain within the boundaries of MarkWest-owned property. \n\n4.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n    Steps\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements sets out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  The propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline, and NGL storage and distribution processes at MarkWest are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.

Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
