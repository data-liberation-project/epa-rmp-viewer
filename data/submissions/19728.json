      "SummaryText": "Source and Process Description\n\nCooper Natural Resources and its predecessor companies have produced the industrial mineral,\nsodium sulfate, from underground brine deposits in west Texas since 1933. Their Cedar Lake\nPlant, located in northeastern Gaines County, has been in operation since 1965. The sodium\nsulfate produced by the plant is a high purity, non hazardous salt that is shipped to customers\nthroughout the United States for use in the detergent, glass, paper, dyestuffs and animal\nhusbandry industries.\n\nThe plant is supplied by shallow wells located in the adjacent, highly saline, Cedar Lake. The\nproduced brine is over nine times the salinity of seawater. This brine is conveyed to the plant by\npipelines. Refrigeration units in the plant are then used to cool the brine and cause the\nprecipitation of the hydrous form of sodium sulfate, Glauber's salt, Na2SO4 X 10 H2O. The\nrefrigeration system contains approximately 67,000 lbs. of ammonia. The hydrous salt produced\nby refrigeration is then recovered by filtration and sent to the drying plant where a vapor\nrecompression unit melts the salt in its waters of hydration. Concentration of the saturated\nsolution results in precipitation of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the marketable product. The\nanhydrous sodium sulfate is subsequently recovered by centrifuges and dried prior to shipment.\n\nNo reagents or reactive chemistries are used in the process. The method of operation is based on\nsimple phase chemistry alone. The plant produces only high purity sodium sulfate salt and\nultra-pure steam condensate.\n\nProgram Status As more fully described herein, the plant meets the eligibility requirements of\nProgram 1 status as provided in 68.12(b) of the RMP Rule because it meets all of the following\nrequirements:\n\n(l)For the five years prior to the submission of an RMP, the process has not had an accidental\nrelease of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products,\noverpressure generated by an explosion"

The results of the Offsite\nConsequence Analysis for both a worst-case and an alternative accidental release scenario may\nbe found in the enclosed Data Elements Checklist.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario: For the worst-case evaluation the amount of ammonia\nhypothetically released was taken as the largest mass of ammonia that is liquefied under pressure\nin any vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system. This would be the ammonia accumulator\nwhich is an outside vessel containing 6,060 lbs. of liquid ammonia. A duration of ten minutes\nwas used in the evaluation resulting in a predicted distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.4 miles.\nThe direction of the plume, and thus the potentially impacted area, would of course be dependent\nupon the wind direction during the release incident. As shown on the accompanying map, See\nAttachment 1, this area is unimproved ranch land. There is one unoccupied house and Farm to\nMarket Road 1066 on the northern extremity of the subject area. Thus, there would be no danger\nto the public of a release of this magnitude. There could be a potential danger to emergency\nresponse units approaching down the company's private road from the north. As stated in the\nCertification section"

The circumstances of the alternative\nscenario were a release through a l/4\" effective diameter orifice leading to an airborne release.\nThe rate of release from a high-pressure receiver would be 100 lb/min. The predicted distance to\nthe Toxic Endpoint is 1,020 ft., which would pose no danger to the public.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance, the plant is also covered by the U.S.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management standard\n(PSM). Additionally, the plant submits an annual \"Tier II\" report to the State Emergency\nResponse Commission, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Gaines County as\nwell as the three local fire departments. The TIER II report lists all hazardous chemicals,\nincluding anhydrous ammonia, that may be held above the threshold quantity at the plant. The\nreport also describes the chemical properties and location of each chemical in the plant in order\nto assist emergency responders should they ever be called to the facility.\nRMP - Executive Summary Page 3, Continued\n\nCooper Natural Resources is an active participant in the Responsible Care program of the\nChemical Manufacturers Association (CMA). The CMA represents nearly 200 chemical\nmanufacturers who account for 90 percent of the country's basic chemical production.

Plant\npersonnel receive annual ammonia training. The plant's process safety management program, an\nOSHA regulation, pertains to ammonia directly and has been an important safeguard in the safe\noperation and emergency preparedness of the plant.\n\nThe plant is required to report any ammonia spills exceeding 100 lbs., the Reportable Quantity\n(RQ) for ammonia. These reports are made to the Federal, State and County regulatory agencies.\nNotwithstanding the safety consequences of an ammonia release. it may be noted that anhydrous\nammonia is a commonly used agricultural fertilizer in the surrounding region where amounts\nmuch greater than the RQ are routinely applied directly to the soil.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases with offsite consequences, as defined in 68.10(b)(1), see\neligibility status above, at the facility within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Cedar Lake Plant is prepared to respond to an emergency situation with ammonia. The\nfacility has a Safety Director on staff. Its emergency response team consists of plant personnel\nwho are knowledgeable of the plant process. They are trained in emergency response and conduct\ndrills on a quarterly basis.
