This is accomplished by compressing the gas to a pressure such that Air/Water passing over the Condenser coils would accept heat from the gas.  The (vaporized) gas, in rejecting heat, condenses, and thus provides liquid to begin the cycle again.\n\nThe ammonia flow direction is based on pressure differences (either by gravity or forced) and by the difference in volume between a gas and a liquid containing the same amount of ammonia.
