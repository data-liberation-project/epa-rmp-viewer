This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass LP gas Distribution - Wholesale.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  These substances include  and Propane.  Propane is used for LP Gas Distribution - Wholesale.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the HSE (Health and Safety Executive Methodology).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from LP Gas Storage.  In this scenario 48112075 lbs. of Propane is released into its diked area.  The release quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls. The released quanitity is liquid. Eventually the liquid will vaporize and presumably find an ignition source. It is assumed that 3 percent of the released quantity will be involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.50 m"
