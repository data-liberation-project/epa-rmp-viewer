Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Suburban Propane - Elk Grove, CA. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass LP gas Distribution - Wholesale.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  These substances include  and Propane.  Propane is used for LP Gas Distribution - Wholesale.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the HSE (Health and Safety Executive Methodology).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from LP Gas Storage.  In this scenario 48112075 lbs. of Propane is released into its diked area.  The release quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls. The released quanitity is liquid. Eventually the liquid will vaporize and presumably find an ignition source. It is assumed that 3 percent of the released quantity will be involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.50 m"

The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 21,000.00 lb. of Propane in 10  minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as sprinkler system(s) and Water Monitors are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s) and Water Monitors.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.15 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from LP Gas Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 1297.56 lb. of Propane in 10  minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as sprinkler system(s) and Water Monitors are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s) and Water Monitors.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with API Standards, NFPA 58, and building codes in effect at time of constricution..    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSuburban Propane - Elk Grove, CA. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and e"
