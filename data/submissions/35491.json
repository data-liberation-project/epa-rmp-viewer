Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed to area fertilizer suppliers and/or farms as a source of land applied Nitrogen fertilizer, or could be distributed to industrial use customers. \n\nMaximum Quantity Stored at this site is 101,000,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in two 9,708,738-gallon atmospheric storage tank(s). The maximum quantity handled would be 50,500,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program is one part of the comprehensive loss prevention and control system implemented at this facility. The implementation of PSM, Administrative Procedures, and Safe Work Practices represent the facility's main active elements of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nTwo reportable incidents have occurred in the last five years at the facility.  On March 8, 2003 an operator was inspecting a leaking valve on a tank truck when the truck driver inadvertently opened the valve.  The operator was exposed to ammonia vapor, and sustained chemical burns to his mouth, throat, and nasal passages.  He was hospitalized overnight and released the following day.  This was the first lost time accident at this facility in over 15 years.  On April 25, 2001 am"

      "SummaryText": "monia vapor was released from a storage tank through a pressure relief valve.  An individual working at an adjacent facility complained of headache and nausea after detecting an ammonia odor.  He finished his work shift and consulted a physician.  It is the author's understanding that the employee returned to work.  No further information is known about this individual.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194, and 33CFR 127.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic.  As this is an ongoing process, improvements are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections, incident investigations, and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
