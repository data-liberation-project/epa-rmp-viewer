We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n? A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n? An overview of our emergency response program\n? An overview of recent improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses Ethylene Oxide and Sulfur Dioxide to produce a wide variety of soaps, detergents and agricultural products for use in consumer and industrial products.  The EPA has identified these chemicals as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario (as defined by the EPA) and alternative release scenarios for our facility. We use information on potential accidental releases to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\n\nAt Clariant Co"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n? Process safety information\n? Process hazard analysis\n? Operating procedures\n? Training and certification of operators\n? Mechanical integrity\n? Management of change\n? Pre-startup review\n? Compliance audits\n? Incident investigation\n? Employee participation\n? Hot work permit\n? Contractor safety\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? Dual, independent safety controls on process systems\n? Operators are specifically trained and certified on the chemical systems they operate. Training is conducted each year in safety and chemical processing, and operators must recertify on the systems they operate every three years.\n? Contractors are selected for their safety record and maintenance capabilities\n? All processes undergo extensive safety analysis by teams of engineers, chemists, plant operators, and maintenance personnel before beginning operation. Systems are reanalyzed at least every five years.\n? All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operators, maintenance, engineering, and chemists in a safety review\n? Hazardous materials handling procedures\n? Ethylene oxide and sulfur dioxide equipment and storage tank inspection, certification and maintenance program\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no RMP-level releases of ethylene oxide or sulfur diox"

      "SummaryText": "ide in the past five years at our facility. However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our site.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nWe also gather information on other significant incidents at other facilities, and implement changes if necessary in our facility to prevent incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. Our program provides the essential training and planning to effectively protect employees, the public, and the environment in emergencies.  The Emergency Plan is tested twice a year to insure that it is current. The facility Emergency Response team also is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), a consortium of area companies that coordinates and help each other during emergencies in which the individual plant's resources may not be sufficient to effectively handle the response.\n\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe facility recently updated its Ethylene Oxide equipment and installed new safety and control systems, reducing the possibility of a release.\n\nIn summary, Clariant is committed to the safe operation of our facility, and we take the actions necessary to ensure the safety of our employees, members of the community, and the environment."
