      "SummaryText": "try to receive the quality system QS-9000 certification.\n\n2.) The plant is operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\n3.) The chief product manufactured at the facility is coke.  Coke is essentially a lump of carbon that has an appearance similar to coal. Coke is used in the blast furnace for the production of steel and in cupola's for the production of iron castings. The castings are used for automotive parts, industrial parts, piping, sewer covers, etc. Coke is also used for processing sugar beets, producing mineral wool, and smelting various metals.\n\nCoke is produced by baking coal in ovens that operate at high temperatures typically around 1800 degrees F. The coal remains in an oven between 24 and 31 hours. During this time the volatile matter in the coal is driven off in the form of gas leaving behind carbon which is the main component of coke. The red hot coke is pushed out of the oven and quenched with water. The coke is then screened to separate the various sizes and shipped to our customers.\n\nThe plant has 3 batteries of coke ovens. E Battery and H Battery have a combined total of 88 ovens. Each of these ovens can hold a 13 ton charge of coal and the batteries carbonizes about 315,000 tons of coal per year. The #1 Battery has 72 ovens. Each of these ovens can hold a 27 ton charge of coal and this battery carbonizes about 635,000 tons of coal per year. The total coke output of the plant is approximately 655,000 tons per year.\n\n4.) The plant produces coal tar, light oil, sulfur, and coke oven gas from the gaseous volatile matter released from the coal.  The coal tar is separated from the gas by cooling the gas to around 90 degrees F and by electrostatic precipitators. The gas is cleaned by a series of scrubbers which remove ammonia, sulfur, and heavy hydrocarbons. After separation and treatment the coal tar and light oil are sold to refiners and have a variety of end uses such as roofing material, cosmetics, and other industrial products. The sulfur is so"

The processes and materials handled at the facility that are included in the risk management plan are described below.\n\n      a.) Coke oven gas manufacturing is a Program Level 3  Process because of the flammability of the gas, the quantity of gas stored on-site, and the potential for offsite consequences.  Coke Oven Gas is a mixture that contains several regulated chemicals. The two most predominant chemicals are methane and hydrogen. Coke oven gas is present throughout the facility in piping or in relatively small vessels. The vast majority of coke oven gas stored  on-site is in a telescoping low-pressure holder that has maximum capacity of 6 million cubic feet. \n\n      b.) The strong ammonia liquor process is a Program Level 1 Process due to the toxicity of ammonia, the quantity stored on-site, and because there is no potential for offsite consequences. The strong ammonia liquor contains about 25% ammonia. It is typically stored in a single storage tank that is located near the center of the plant. The liquor originates from the ammonia destruct system. The purpose of this system is to remove ammonia from the coke oven gas and to destroy the ammonia in a catalytic reactor. One reactor is normally on line and another reactor is available as a spare. The strong ammonia liquor is only produced on the rare occasion when both reactors are shutdown for repair. The liquor is destroyed when the ammonia destruct reactor is operating. As a result, the inventory of liquor is generally very low. \n\n      c.) The waste water treatment process is a Program Level 1 Process due to the toxicity of formaldehyde, the quantity stored on site, and because there is no potential for offsite consequences. The waste water treatment plant treats the process waste water resulting from the coking process. The waste water originates from the moist"

The waste water treatment plant is a conventional aerobic biological treatment system that consists of aeration basins and clarifiers. A 37% Formaldehyde solution is added to the waste water at the end of the treatment plant to polish the effluent. The formaldehyde is stored in a single tank that has complete secondary containment.\n\nIII.  Description of the Worst Case Release Scenario's and the Alternative Case Scenario:\n\n1.) Worst Case Release Scenario for Coke Oven Gas:\n\n      EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance document was used to determine the worst case scenario and the consequences of this scenario.\n\n      According to the EPA guidance, the worst case scenario for coke oven gas is a catastrophic failure of the holder and a release of all the stored coke oven gas resulting in an explosion. The major components of coke oven gas were used to determine the impact distance. The explosion would have an impact radius of about 0.44 miles.\n\n      The holder was first constructed in the early 1930's and no such incident has ever occurred. The holder is routinely inspected and repaired as necessary. The holder is protected from over pressurizing with a flare system. The operation of the holder is monitored by experienced personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Moreover, all reasonable possibilities for failure have been reviewed and appropriate safeguards have been installed.\n\n2.) Alternative Release Scenario for Coke Oven Gas:\n\n      The release scenario that would most likely effect the public is a release from the gas holder since this vessel is the closest coke oven gas storage vessel to the public. Again, EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance document was used to determine this scenario. \n\n      The most reasonable release scenario for the coke oven gas is a flash fire. This fire could result from gas escaping from a hole in the holder. A relatively large hole would be required tha"

The radius from such a flash fire would be about 0.06 miles.\n\n3.) Worst Case Release Scenario for 25% Ammonia Solution:\n\n      The worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the storage tank when full with the release of the entire contents of the tank. EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.05 was utilized to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint. Upon release,  the solution would flow into a diked area and into the basement of a building. The dike and the basement would reduce the surface area and the  evaporation rate of the ammonia. The distance to toxic endpoint is estimated to be 0.1 miles which is inside the boundaries of the plant.\n\n      The storage tank is routinely inspected and repaired as necessary making this scenario very unlikely. An alternative release scenario was not performed since the worst case release scenario had no offsite impacts.\n\n4.) Worst Case Release Scenario for 37% Formaldehyde Solution.\n\n      The 37% formaldehyde solution is used for waste water treatment. The solution is stored in a single tank that is surrounded by secondary containment. EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance document was used to determine the worst case scenario and the consequences of this scenario.\n\n      The worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank when full with the release of the entire contents of the tank. Upon release,  the solution would flow into the diked area. The dike  would reduce the surface area and evaporation rate of the formaldehyde. The distance to the toxic endpoint is estimated to be 0.06 miles which is inside the boundaries of the plant. The release rate for formaldehyde was calculated to be 0.1 lbs./min. but the RMP submit program would not allow a number less than 0.2.\n\n      The storage tank is routinely inspected and "

The General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\n      The facility is also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management rule.  We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases that may occur.\nPrevention measures include: \n1)  Safety controls such as leak detectors, warning alarms, and automatic shutdowns.\n2)  Regular equipment inspections, predictive maintenance and preventative maintenance to ensure  proper operation.\n3)  Incident investigation procedures to develop corrective actions.\n4)  Trained operators are onsite 24 hours per day to monitor the process and to take action when necessary for safe operation.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History:\n\n      There were no reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Indianapolis fire department tours our facility at least once per year to keep updated on our process and to plan responses. All personnel are regularly trained on safety and accident prevention. We have instituted a notification program with CAN (communication alert network) that will automatically notify our neighbors in the event of an emergency.\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n1)  Increase safety staff to monitor safety program and develop new effective accident prevention programs. \n2)  Continue to track new government regulations for immediate implementation.\n3)  Continue to work with local and national industry partners in developing systems/procedures to strive    for an accident free work place."
