      "SummaryText": "Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant is committed to the safety of our workers, the public, and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of a hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0\tDescription of the City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek \tWater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Van Buren, Arkansas.  The facility is part of the City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs water distribution system which has 13 contract customers and services an area with a population of over 150,000 people.  The City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tChlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of drinking water prior to releasing to the clear well.\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n\nThe RMP Rule requires The City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOne worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe following information summarizes these offsite consequ"

The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site endpoints and public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a cylinder valve sticking in the open position during delivery operations allowing a sixty minute release of chlorine gas.  The toxic cloud formed by the escaping gas would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and\n\tChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant has implemented procedures from their written Risk Management Prevention Program for operations involving the chlorination process.  The following details the prevention program elements at the City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n4.2\tHazard Review\n\nThe City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the City of Fort Smith\u00c2\u00bfs Lee Creek Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a"
