      "SummaryText": "Our company strives to maintain a safe workplace for our employees and for the communities we serve. Our farmer owners, managers and employees have made every attempt to plan and prevent any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia to our farmer customers nurse tanks.\n \nThis is a new Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility, the first fill date 3-27-00.  The maximum quantity stored  would be 140,196 pounds which  is one 30,000 gallon storage tank. The worst case release scenerio would be the release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 53000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 2.50 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history from our other locations a break in a transfer hose.  The alternative release data is as follows: a two minute release of anhydrous ammonia which is approximately 26638 pounds and produces an endpoint of 1.14 miles\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused injury or death on site or off site nor have we had a release that has required evacuation or sheltering in place at any of our anhydrous ammonia facilities.  Our company maintains an accident free workplace , by completing annual training and adhering to the state rules and regulations that govern the use of this produt.\n\nThe emergency plan and coordination of this plan with local emergency responders is designed to minimize the risk to both employees and emergency responders and the the general public. We are proud of our excellent safety record and will always strive to improve our efforts."
