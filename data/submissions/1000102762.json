Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Omega Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe processes at the Omega Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nMarkWest encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team. Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nHot Work Permit \n\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0096 OMEGA GAS PLANT \n\nMarkWest Oklahoma, L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Omega Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Omega Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system. Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catchers which separates condensate and free water from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, carbon dioxide is removed, and it is dehydrated to remove any water. The gas then enters a cryogenic process where ethane and heavier natural gas liquids (NGLs) are separated from the methane gas stream. The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline and the NGLs, also known as Y-grade, are pumped into a product pipeline for sales. \n\nThe products at the Omega Gas Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario, and 40 CFR 68.28 for the alternative release scenario analysis. The worst case and alternative case radii to"
