The residue gas is also removed by a gas pipeline for transport to end users.  \r\n\r\nThe South Eddy Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the South Eddy Gas Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  Refrigerant grade propane is also used at the facility in the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at South Eddy Gas Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (SDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.
