      "SummaryText": "The Bardstown Water Treatment Plant, located off of Boston Road in Bardstown, Kentucky, maintains active Accidental Release Prevention and Process Safety Management Programs.  This facility treats the City's drinking water using Chlorine, a chemical covered by the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program.  Chlorine is delivered to and stored at the facility in high-pressure cylinders that contain up to 2,000 pounds of liquefied Chlorine each when they are full.\n\nThe facility's worst-case release scenario, as required by EPA, involves a sudden release of the entire contents of one full chlorine storage container over a time span of ten minutes.  The release would be mitigated (slowed down) by the fact that the chlorine would be released into the process building.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, one that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, involves a leak through the valve opening in the container.  The release rate would be slower than the worst-case scenario, and the offsite impact area would be smaller.\n\nThis facility is subject to, has implemented, and is in compliance with the occupational safety and Health Agency (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program as it applies to the handling of Chlorine in the process equipment located at the facility.\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases at this facility over the past five years that have led to onsite or offsite impacts to people or the environment."
