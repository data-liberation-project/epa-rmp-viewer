Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nHaltermann\u00bfs prevention policy is that we will strive to prevent any uncontrolled release of hazardous chemical from this site.  Haltermann is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  These legislations were enacted to prevent accidental releases of certain flammable and toxic chemicals.  Haltermann goes beyond the requirements of the law and works to prevent accidental releases of any chemical.\n\nHaltermann\u00bfs emergency response policy is to respond as quickly as possible with adequate resources to stop the incident from spreading.  No secrets will be held from the public.  The response plan includes notification of local authorities and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nHaltermann Products makes gasoline blends for the automobile industry. \n\nChemicals are received and shipped by tank truck, rail car, barge and drums.  Access to the site is restricted to company employees, authorized customers and designated contractors.\n\nThe RMP chemicals continuously on site are: Butane, Isobutane, Isopentane, Isoprene\n\nThere are severl chemicals that Haltermann is filing with the EPA on a predictive basis.  We have handled some of these chemicals in the past and there is a remote chance of handling them in the future.  These flammable chemicals include:\n \n1,3-Pentadiene\n2-Butene\n2-Butene-trans\n1,3-Butadiene\n2-Butene-cis\n1-Butene\n2,2-Dimethylpropane\n2-Methyl-1-butene\n1-Pentene\n2-Methyl-1-butene\n2-Pentene, (E)-\n2-Pentene, (Z)-\n3-Methyl-butene\nButene\nPentane\nPropane\n\nHaltermann will notify the North Channel LEPC and amend its RMP with the EPA if handling any of the above flammable chemicals make its Worst Case Flammable Scenario or Alternate"

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternate release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nNOTE: If additional information is needed on the scenarios below please contact Haltermann at 832-376-2208.\n\nToxic Worse Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nHaltermann Products does not currently handle any RMP Toxic chemicals.\n \nFlammable Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is a total failure of a 12,700 gallon storage tank that holds isobutane.  The material vaporizes and explodes.  The explosion will mainly effect Haltermann\u00bfs industrial neighbors.\n\nFlammable Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Flammable Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) is a 500 pound per minute leak of Isobutane from an broken level instrument on the storage tank that explodes after a 15 minute release.  This release will only effect Haltermann\u00bfs closest neighbors.  \n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nHaltermann\u00bfs prevention program is compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program.   \n\nHaltermann prevents releases by designing processes to handle chemicals safely.  \n\nWe conduct safety reviews on the processes to ensure they are capable of handling chemicals safely.  \n\nWe have documented operating procedures for operating and our equipment safely.  \n\nWe maintain our equipment so it operates safely.  \n\nWe inspect our equipment so it does not degrade over time.   \n\nWe train our personnel to operate and maintain our equipment in a safe and proper manner.  \n\nWe test our employees for drugs and alcohol, and give them annual physicals to ensure they are capable of safely operating our equipment.  \n\nWe conduct audits of our systems and procedures to ensure they are effective.  \n\n5.
