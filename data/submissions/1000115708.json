Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThe Wacker Chemical Corporation, Polymers Division (Wacker) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP). Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:\n\n1.\tThe main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and\n2.\tThe storage, pipeline, and vinyl acetate barge unloading source at the Tennessee River.\n\nThe largest quantity raw material feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of Wacker's VAE Emulsions and SekiSui Polyvinyl Alcohol. Ethylene is also used in the production of VAE dispersions (emulsions). VAM, and ethylene are above threshold quantities at the main plant. Only Vinyl Acetate is present at the barge unloading facility on the Tennessee River. Wacker is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky, and local rules and regulations. The Wacker Site Manager at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.\n\nAs a site compliant with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, the Calvert City plant strives to prevent chemical emergencies. Prevention of chemical emergencies includes specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, etc. meet all applicable design codes and specifications. Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation. Trained and qualified employees work with sophisticated control systems that include instrumentation, alarms, and shutdowns to keep our processes operating in safe limits that minimize adverse impacts on the employees, the surro"

Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant. Our Polymers Safety Process (PSP) contains many elements including management of change, hot work procedures, and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology.\n\nAll contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that Wacker employees must follow. The emergency response plan includes OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees. Wacker shares emergency response resources on the plant site with the Sekisui Evonik. Wacker, Evonik and Sekisui participate in a partnership among the Calvert City area industries named the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program or CIMAP. The CIMAP organization collaborates with community emergency responders and citizens to form the core of a strong Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC. Wacker is an active member of the LEPC and the Calvert City Community Advisory Team.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40CFR Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.

VAM is pumped to the main plant via a pipeline. The only RMP regulated substance handled at this stationary source is Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a toxic liquid. The maximum quantity of VAM inventoried in an individual storage tank is 11,745,000 pounds. The worst case scenario (toxics) for the river facility is complete failure of containment by that vessel (tank FB-4516) with containment by the dike that surrounds the tank. The alternative case scenario is leakage of the entire tank capacity to the dike. This was selected because if a leak were discovered to be ongoing within the dike it might be a case where we would not send a worker into the dike to stop the leak (unsafe to have them walk in VAM). If necessary, we would take steps to isolate the leak by shutting valves upstream and downstream from the leak.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\n\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process. This protection starts with the facility design and construction. Wacker meets or exceeds all design and construction codes when implementing new projects in the plant. A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping. These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques with records maintained in the permanent equipment files.\n\nBarge unloading activities are controlled by two people that are present during the unloading. These unloaders are contractors working for the barge company that have been trained and certified as tankermen by the US Coast Guard. When unloading a barge, they can instantly stop VAM transfers at any time. They can also contact emergency assistance via two separate means of communication.\n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontr"

Containment dikes around the storage tanks are designed to hold the entire contents of the tank.\n\nEach plant process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and start-up. All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made. At periods not to exceed five years, Operating Plant Hazards Reviews (OPHRS) are conducted by teams of supervisors, engineers, operators, mechanics, and EH&S professionals.\n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the production unit, plant, and corporate levels. These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and tracked through plant safety management systems.\n\nWacker maintains a procedure to assure PHA's and revalidations are conducted within prescribed timeframes. PHA's are conducted anytime a process or system has been modified significantly. A management system is in place to document and track PHA actions to timely completion, assigning resources as needed to maintain demonstrable progress. The PHA's are completed appropriately to the processes identified and are evaluated to control the hazards involved in the processes. The PHA addresses hazards of the process, previous incidents with potential for catastrophic consequences, engineering and administrative controls such as detection to provide early warning, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, stationary source siting, human factors, and qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.

      "SummaryText": "onsequences, resulted in any employee injuries, or resulted in any significant equipment damage.\n\n5.\tThe emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard. Wacker, Evonik and Sekisui share emergency response resources. There are at least 16 trained emergency responders in the fire and rescue squad that are divided across four shifts and day workers. Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer. In an emergency, the safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.\n\nOn-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck, and a Hazmat Response trailer. In addition to these resources, Wacker is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can draw from pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities. As a member of the LEPC, Wacker regularly stages emergency response drills both in-house and outside with emergency responders from the public and private sector. LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel, and emergency procedures.\n\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe process safety information and systems are evaluated regularly through the Operational Plant Hazard Reviews, with industry-wide changes in standards and as a result of incidents that have occurred within the chemical industry. The VAM storage tanks have no outstanding upgrade recommendations.\n\nThe Calvert Area Emergency Warning System (CAEWS) is an emergency notification system to alert the community of a chemical and/or weather-related emergency. The system is composed of a siren network in Calvert City and Livingston County that is activated by the 911 operator. The 911 operator is backed up by the safety officer at Evonik, who can also activate the system. In the event of an emergency, 911 would activate the sirens and voice command"

      "SummaryText": "modules that are placed in public buildings such as the Convalescent Center, City Hall, and the Calvert City Elementary School. Once a citizen has heard the siren or the voice command module alert, they are to turn their radio on the local Calvert City radio station (WCCK) and listen for specific instructions. The sirens are routinely tested one day per month.\n\nThe CAEWS also has a telephone notification system that can be activated by any of the ten participating plants. In the event of a chemical emergency, a plant could activate the system to notify everyone in the community within a five-mile radius of the complex. These calls notify people of the emergency, instruct them to Shelter-in-place, and tune to their local radio station for more information. The system can make an All-Clear call to notify everyone that the emergency has passed. The system also has a test notification that can be activated in conjunction with any drills. In the event of an incident with no off-site consequences, plants can activate the system to notify emergency responders, plant personnel, and the media that no emergency exists."
