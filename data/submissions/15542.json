Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe City of Vero Beach Water Treatment Plant (Vero Beach) is owned by the City of Vero Beach.  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Vero Beach Water Treament facility is a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located at 3225 North U.S.1, north of downtown Vero Beach, Indian River County, Florida.   Vero Beach adds chlorine in their chlorination process in order to disinfect the City's water supply.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twenty-two  one-ton containers at the Chlorination process.  Eight one-ton containers are always connected to the process, while up to fourteen additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 44,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not enclosed in a building.\n\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario is the rupture of a ton container from the Chlorination process, releasing 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, the chlorine gas could travel 3.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance lookup tables.\n\nThe Alternative-Case release scenario is characterized by a  two phase release due the failure of the liquid supply valve connection from worker/human error, external impact, or corrosion.  For the chlorination  process, the release rate was determined to be 1,387 lbs/min.  Under normally expected weather conditions, the chlorine gas could travel 1.5 miles be"

Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Vero Beach Chlorination process in the Program 3 level.  The Vero Beach facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nVero Beach has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  To ensure that all requirements of the RMP regulation were met, the PSM Program was reviewed and updated in 1999.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the City of Vero Beach.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when "

Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Vero Beach facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Vero Beach has an Emergency Response Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Indian River County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and notifying Florida State Warning Point at 1-(800) 320-0519."
