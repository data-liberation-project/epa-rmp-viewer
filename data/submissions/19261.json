If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Centre Hall Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis is a frozen food processing facility. We use propane for the winter heating of the Plant, Potato Storage Facility and the Waste Water Treatment Plant. Propane is also used to refuel a few lift trucks on the premises. There are three separate propane systems at the facility. System #1 is located behind the Potato Storage Facility. It consists of two 2,500 gallon tanks and associated piping, valves and heating units with burners, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. System #2 is located behind the Main Plant Building. It consists of 1 18,000 gallon tank, piping, valves and associated heaters and other miscellaneous equipment including a bottle fill station and scales.System #3 is located at the Waste Water Treatment Plant. It consists of two 500 gallon tanks, piping, valves and heaters and other miscellaneous equipment.\n    \nThe worst case scenario is failure of the 18,000 gallon tank when filled to its greatest allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA look up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles. The facility does have public receptors within this range both on site and off. The potential could be as many as 20 persons.There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is used at the facility as a refrigerant medium. The system consists of 1 - 14,000 gallon storage vessel along with two continuous tunnel freezers and one spiral freezer, numerous compressors, condensors, evaporators and associated pipework, valves, safety relief valves and other miscellanous equipment.\n\nThe worst case scenario is failure of the 14,000 gallon storage tank in the ammonia system resulting in a liquid release.
