The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe facility conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\n4.\tFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility has an excellent record concerning minimizing recordable and reportable accidents. There have been no accidents at the facility that require inclusion in the five-year accident history as required by the RMP regulations.\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\nPOET maintains a written emergency response program in its EAP. The purpose of the EAP is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. In the event of a chemical emergency, POET\u0092s Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release. The emergency action plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a"

The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\nPOET maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including normal operations, manual operation, and emergency shutdown. The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.\n\nContractors\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nPOET conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.

Computer based maintenance software is utilized to implement automatic scheduling and work order generation for covered process preventative maintenance inspections and monitoring. The POET facility is staffed year-round, 24 hours per day. The facility is lighted and access-controlled. Ammonia alarms have been installed and are monitored to detect an ammonia release. The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual alarm lights on the alarm system control panel. Both visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms in the control room are sounded in the event of a release.\nEmployee Participation\nPOET has developed an employee participation program. All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nThe facility utilizes the PHA Lite methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, fire, explosion, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, contamination, equipment failure, loss of cooling, heating, electricity, instrument air and tornados.

This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. POET is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance above threshold quantities.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nPOET is committed to the protection of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment from industrial materials used in the bioethanol production process. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, POET has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from the release of hazardous materials.\n\nThe facility relies on outside services, LEPC, Fire, and Police to respond to major release events. If a release does occur, the facility's emergency response is described in its emergency action plan (EAP) developed per 29 CFR 1910.38(a). It is the policy of POET to notify the Macon Fire Department, evacuate or shelter-in-place all employees at the facility, and provide technical and logistic support to the Fire Department Incident Commander.\n\n2.\tFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nPOET main product is bioethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.
