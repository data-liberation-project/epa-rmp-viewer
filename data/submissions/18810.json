THROUGHOUT WILBUR-ELLIS A COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY PROGRAM IS IN EFFECT WHICH INCLUDES TRAINING, INSPECTIONS, SAFETY MEETINGS AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY.  THIS FACILITY STORES AND HANDLES AMMONIA FOR FERTILIZER USE.  THE CHEMICAL IS STORED IN TWO ABOVE GROUND TANKS.  NO OTHER CHEMICAL PROCESSES ARE ON SITE.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO INVOLVES THE RELEASE OF THE LARGEST TANK INSTANTANEOUSLY.  THE OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE INVOLVE THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND THE PLANT.  THIS WAS DETERMINED USING THE ALOHA MODEL.  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO INVOLVES THE INSTANTANEOUS LOSS OF FIVE GALLONS FROM DISCONNECTING A HOSE.  THIS FACILITY IS COVERED BY OSHA REGULATIONS AND IS VISITED ANNUALLY BY VARIOUS OTHER AGENCIES.  THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS INVOLVING AMMONIA.  OCCASIONALLY JOINT EXCERCISES WITH LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE HELD ONSITE.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS REVIEWED AND TRAINED ANNUALLY.  WILBUR-ELLIS SAFETY TRAINING IS AN ONGOING PROCESS EACH YEAR AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS ARE SHARED WITH LOCAL AND COUNTY AGENCIES."
