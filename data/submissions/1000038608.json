Inspections, maintenance and employee training are important components of our accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  The owners, management, and employees of Adkins Energy, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  The facility also has prepared an Emergency Action Plan that addresses response to incidents and evacuation. \n\n\n\n2. Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at Adkins Energy, LLC is the production of ethanol from corn.   Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored, and used in the ethanol production process as a buffer and nitrogen source during the fermentation process.  The maximum storage of anhydrous ammonia is 77,000 pounds.   The facility also uses natural gasoline as a denaturant for the final product.  The natural gasoline is a flammable mixture (NFPA 4) that contains pentane and isopentane, among other ingredients.  The maximum storage of denaturant/natural gasoline is 230,000 pounds.   \n\n\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Adkins Energy, LLC has implemented Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Prevention Programs to manage the use of its covered materials.  These programs cover employee participation, process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response, compliance audits, hot work and other safe work"

For anhydrous ammonia, the facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations are administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of covered materials at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  The Emergency Action Plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in community response planning.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  Adkins recently completed a 5-year Process Hazard Analysis Update and 3-Year Compliance Audit and is addressing recommendations from those exercises. "
