      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies: \n\n\n\nJames Austin Company houses one chemical, chlorine, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies as hazardous. \n\n\n\nJames Austin Company has deployed numerous safety devices, procedures, and inspections to prevent an accidental release. A total of ten chlorine gas detectors are positioned in strategic areas to be able to detect chlorine concentrations should a failure in the system occur. These chlorine gas detectors are linked to the facility's monitoring system and will automatically signal an alarm upon the chlorine part per million concentration reaching specific levels. The Emergency Response Team is trained to apply response procedures and emergency equipment to contain a leak. Periodic drills and annual training is conducted to verify employee understanding on actions when an alarm is sounded. The Emergency Response Team (ERT) have completed at least 24-hr HAZWOPER training as well as the required annual 8-hr refresher training. James Austin Company has applied the inspection of all process equipment in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections. These assessments verify proper functionality of equipment and allow our team to repair or replace deficient findings. Yearly, the Adams Area Fire District and Butler County LEPC are invited out for a plant tour in which case they can provide feedback and suggestions on ways to improve safety. This tour is also used to fully communicate and showcase changes that have been made to the system in the form of equipment, chemical, or overall processes to assist them in the event of having to respond to an emergency.  \n\n\n\n2) The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled: \n\n\n\nJames Austin Company was acquired by KIK Custom Products on March 20, 2018. Since this acquisition, KIK has worked diligently to upgrade process equipment, procedures, and inspections. James Austin Company was establishe"

All of the products are produced by either dilution or blending or a combination of the two. Cleaning products include bleach, ammonia, drain openers, detergents, and degreasers. Of all of the chemicals housed onsite, Chlorine is the only regulated substance under the EPA Risk Management Plan. Although the facility's rail side can house a total of five rail cars, the facility will house a maximum of two full chlorine rail cars. Chlorine is utilized in conjunction with sodium hydroxide and water to formulate sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solutions at varying strengths. \n\n\n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nThere are several regulations which aide as preventative measures in reducing the risk of injury or a release. Of these regulations, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 CFR 1910.119, establishes requirements closely related to those of the EPA's RMP to prevent a release and exposure. The elements of both standards, PSM and RMP, cover critical areas to aide in reducing the risks involved with housing and processing a regulated substance. James Austin Company processors perform daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections on process equipment to ensure its integrity and functionality. Each chlorine rail car is thoroughly inspected for deficiencies or questionable activity. All processors involved with the connection or disconnection of a chlorine rail car are required to undergo extensive training as well as don a full-face respirator and impervious gloves. UniPro Pneumatic Actuators are attached to the liquid and vapor hand valve of the rail car and are utilized as a normal and emergency closure. If gas monitors detect chlorine levels above 3 ppm, the system will trigger the UniPros to perform their closing rotat"

If there is no answer or if employees communicate hazard, emergency response crews will be dispatched. Two Processors must perform disconnection and connection procedures and there must be a minimum of three emergency response trained employees onsite. \n\n\n\n4) Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable quantity releases nor employee or community injuries stemming from the regulated substance. \n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Program: \n\n\n\nAll employees are trained on hazard communication, emergency response awareness, and both fire and chlorine drills are conducted periodically. Employees are instructed to locate and assess wind direction by utilizing wind socks while conducting these drills. Members of the Emergency Response Team received additional training surrounding the hazards associated with the chemicals, response measures, required personal protective equipment, HAZWOPER, and application of a C-Kit onto a railcar dome. All emergency response equipment is inspected and maintained within an Emergency Response Shed located on the opposite side of the building. In the event that a leak occurs that exceeds the IDLH limit, emergency responders will meet at the shed to don the appropriate level of PPE and gas monitors to further respond to the leak. James Austin Company has two C-Kits to respond to a leak stemming from a connected rail car and a residual rail car placed further along our rail siding. Standard operating procedures are implemented and used as training tools for all work being conducted on or with the regulated substance. In addition, the local fire department and LEPC attend an annual plant tour to maintain their familiarity with our systems and associated hazards. This enables all parties to respond appropriately in the event of an emergency situation. \n\n\n\n6) Planned Chang"
