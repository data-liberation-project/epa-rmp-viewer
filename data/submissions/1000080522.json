The third-party monitoring service will dispatch emergency response crews if there is no answer or if employees communicate a hazard.

Employees are instructed to locate and assess wind direction by utilizing wind socks while conducting these drills. Members of the Emergency Response Team received additional training surrounding the hazards associated with the chemicals, response measures, required personal protective equipment, HAZWOPER, and application of a C-Kit onto a railcar dome. All emergency response equipment is inspected and maintained within an Emergency Response Shed located on the opposite side of the building. In the event that a leak occurs that exceeds the IDLH limit, emergency responders will meet at the shed to don the appropriate level of PPE and gas monitors to further respond to the leak. James Austin Company has two C-Kits to respond to a leak stemming from a connected rail car and a residual rail car placed further along our rail siding. All work conducted on or with the regulated substance includes the implementation and use of standard operating procedures as training tools. In addition, the local fire department and LEPC attend an annual plant tour to maintain their familiarity with our systems and associated hazards. This enables all parties to respond appropriately in the event of an emergency. \n\n6) Planne"

All the products are produced by either dilution blending or a combination of the two. Cleaning products include bleach, ammonia, drain openers, detergents, and degreasers. Of all the chemicals housed onsite, chlorine is the only regulated substance under the EPA Risk Management Plan. Although the facility's rail side can house a total of five rail cars, the facility will house a maximum of two full chlorine rail cars. Chlorine is utilized in conjunction with sodium hydroxide and water to formulate sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solutions at varying strengths. \n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nSeveral regulations aid as preventative measures in reducing the risk of injury or a release. Of these regulations, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 CFR 1910.119, establishes requirements closely related to those of the EPA's RMP to prevent a release and exposure. The elements of both standards, PSM and RMP, cover critical areas to aid in reducing the risks involved with housing and processing a regulated substance. James Austin Company processors perform daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annual, and annual inspections on process equipment to ensure its integrity and functionality. The processors at James Austin Company perform thorough inspections on each chlorine rail car to identify any deficiencies or questionable activity. All processors involved with the connection or disconnection of a chlorine rail car are required to undergo extensive training as well as don a full-face respirator and impervious gloves. Unipro Pneumatic Actuators are attached to the liquid and vapor hand valve of the rail car and are utilized as a normal and emergency closure.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies: \n\nJames Austin Company houses one chemical, chlorine, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies as hazardous. \n\nJames Austin Company has deployed numerous safety devices, procedures, and inspections to prevent an accidental release. In strategic areas, the company has placed ten chlorine gas detectors to detect chlorine concentrations in the event of a system failure. When the chlorine concentration reaches specific levels per million, these chlorine gas detectors will automatically signal an alarm through the facility's monitoring system. The Emergency Response Team receives training to apply response procedures and emergency equipment to contain a leak. The company periodically conducts drills and annual training to verify that employees understand how to respond when they hear an alarm. The Emergency Response Team (ERT) has completed at least 24-hr HAZWOPER training as well as the required annual 8-hr refresher training. James Austin Company has applied the inspection of all process equipment in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections. These assessments verify proper functionality of equipment and allow our team to repair or replace deficient findings. Yearly, the Adams Area Fire District and Butler County LEPC are invited out for a plant tour in which case they can provide feedback and suggestions on ways to improve safety. This tour is also used to fully communicate and showcase changes that have been made to the system in the form of equipment, chemical, or overall processes to assist them in the event of having to respond to an emergency.  \n\n2) The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled: \n\nJames Austin Company was acquired by KIK Custom Products on March 20, 2018. Since this acquisition, KIK has worked diligently to upgrade process equipment, procedures, and inspections. James Austin Company was established at the Mars, PA"
