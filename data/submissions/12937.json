In the case of Chlorine cylinders, they are inspected for integrity and leaks and placed onto pallets where they are secured together by airplane type ratchet straps which prevent any movement of the cylinders. The pallets are then transported to a ground level storage area outside of the building. While in storage they are checked daily for deterioration or leaks. When they are needed they are transported back inside the warehouse where they are inspected and then loaded onto trucks for the deliveries. Drummed products are received, shrink wrapped on high grade pallets  ,four to each pallet. The pallets are high grade and are supplied by the shipper. These drums are checked for integrity and leaks and if acceptable they are transported by fork lift to the storage area. All drummed products are stored no higher than two drums in height.

While in stock the drums are checked daily for integrity and leakage. They are inspected again when they are loaded on the truck for delivery to our customer.
