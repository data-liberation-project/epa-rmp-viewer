Kersenbrock, Manager\nGlen Kersenbrock, Manager\n\nThe owner's, management, and employees of Colby Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 100,000 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be unloading of a transport tank holding 46,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank.  (released as a gas over 10 minutes)  The maximum quantity released would be 100,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.37 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles."
