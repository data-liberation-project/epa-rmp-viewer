All anhydrous ammonia plant operators receive training on the hazards and safety procedures related to handling anhydrous ammonia. This includes:\n2.\tPhysical Hazards, emergency procedures and first aid.\n3.\tPlant normal and emergency start-up, operating, and shutdown procedures.\n4.\tPlant inspection and maintenance procedures.\n5.\tPlant design, including physical protection from identified hazards such as vehicular collision and installation of emergency shutoff valves.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThis fixed facility has experienced no reportable accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nEmergency response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is accomplished by one of three methods, depending on the severity and anticipated duration of the release.\n1.\tFor minor releases, most commonly caused by a valve leak or failure during operation and that are quickly isolated, trained operators, working from an upwind and safe location will isolate the leak to minimize the amount of product released. Safety equipment available to operators at all times includes indirect vented goggles, chemical resistant gloves, and air purifying respirators.\n2.\tFor a more serious release that may be difficult to isolate, trained operators will notify city and county emergency management via the local sheriff\u00bfs office emergency telephone number along with a description of the difficulty, expected duration, recommended community protective actions and the need for assistance, if any. Hazmat-trained operators working with local emergency responders will don appropriate personal protective equipment to isolate the release. Protective actions for the public will be implemented as well as actions to minimize environmental impact from the release.\n3.\tIn the event of a release that cannot be isolated due to the nature of the damage/failure or due to the lack of adequate personal protective equipmen"
