The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the related process, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identifiable equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases at Nederland Terminal in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nNederland Terminal maintains a written defensive emergency response program.  The program addresses appropriate aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Jefferson County LEPC."

The terminal receives, stores, and distributes crude oil, feedstocks, lubricants, petrochemicals, and bunker oils (used for fueling ships and other marine vessels) and also blends lubricants. \r\n\r\nThe storage capacity of three flammable chemicals (propane, n-butane, and propylene) exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability and is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\nNederland Terminal has developed a set of Management System procedures to manage implementation of the elements of the RMP program.

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidelines from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. Nederland Terminal has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and the PHA will be revalidated and updated once every 5 years.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\nAs required by the RMP rule the worst-case release scenario is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of one of the pipelines or storage equipment. The current version of the USEPA's RMP-Comp software was used in the analysis and the estimated release rates were calculated by the software with a release duration of 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, was conservatively analyzed by the same approach with vapor cloud explosion scenario. The USEPA's RMP-Comp version software was used in the analysis.
