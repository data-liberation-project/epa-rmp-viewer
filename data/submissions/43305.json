      "SummaryText": "The City of Las Vegas Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) operates a biosolids stabilization process from which digester gas, primarily methane and carbon monoxide, is a byproduct.  The WPCF stores methane (digester gas) in quantities above the regulatory thresholds that subject the WPCF to RMP, as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  Digester gas is a byproduct of the biosolids stabilization process and consists of primarily methane and carbon monoxide,The PSM consists of three compliance programs, each with progressively stricter compliance standards.  The digester gas process at the WPCF is subject to Program 2 because a worst-case release of digester gas would not affect the public and would be limited to the WPCF property.  The PSM consists of three major parts.  The first part is the Hazard Assessment.  The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the effects of a release of a regulated substance could have on the public.  The second partis the Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.  The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur.  A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  This information was used by WPCF staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases.  Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHA that was performed for the digester gas process.  The digester gas system PHA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of WPCF staff familiar with the process operation and maintenance and plant management.  The PHA was done using a combination of \"What-If\" and \"Checklist\" methods.  Based on the results of the PHAs, numerous changes in operating, maintenance, and ot"

      "SummaryText": "her process safety management proceedures that would improve the overall safety of the WPCF were identified.  All improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards have been implemented or incorporated into the overall Process Safety Management Program.  Operating proceedures for the digester gas process have been developed as part of the PSM.  Written operating proceedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility.  The goal of the operating proceedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process.  Operating proceedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.  The detailed operating proceedures include startup, shutdown and emergency operating proceedures.  The proceedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidential release.  The proceedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.  An effective PSM training program can significantly reduce the number and severity of accidental release incidences.  Employees involved in operating or maintaining the digester gas process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance proceedures and an overview of the process.  Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.  An effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release.  The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training.  The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle digester gas is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.  The WPCF maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative ma"

      "SummaryText": "intenance (PM), provide safety proceedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of perts and materials.  In addition to preventative maintenance, the WPCF staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown.  In the event of an incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of digester gas an investigation will be conducted.  An investigation team will identify the underlying causes of the incident and will implement proceedures for preventing similar events in the future.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes.  The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.  The Emergency Planning and Response plan provides specific emergency response proceedures for accidential release of digester gas.  The emergency response proceedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through either a leak or stoppage or hazmat assistance.  As part of the emergency response proceedures there are instructions for leak investigation, alerting and communication with additional support agencies.  The Emergency Response Plan provides plant evacuation proceedures and indicates the level of training needed to carry out emergency response proceedures.  The WPCF does not train or authorize staff to respond in the capacity of a first responder.  Events requiring the level of training necessary for First Responder Operative are communicated to 911 for emergency response."
