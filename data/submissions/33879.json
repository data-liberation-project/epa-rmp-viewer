Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  Accidental release prevention is a function of the safety devices (technology) inherent in the facility design, safe material handling practices used (procedures), and commitment to training of plant employees (management practices).  All applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Prevention Program (40 CFR 68.65-87) are adhered to.  It is a goal of the Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant to ensure plant and community safety through an aggressive program of hazard analysis, preventive maintenance, equipment testing, standard operating procedures, and employee training.\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of a emergency preparedness plan which is tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.   The emergency preparedness program includes procedures for notification of the City of Greenwood and Greenwood County HAZMAT Teams (off-site mutual aid response), Greenwood County LEPC (community response plan), and SCDHEC (state response plan).  The Greenwood Metropolitan District Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency preparedness program is based upon recommendations of the Water Environment Federation (WEF), the Chlorine Institute and is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Emergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.90) requirements.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe regulated substances handled and used at the Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant is chlorine.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the facility at anytime is 4,000 pounds (2 ton containers).\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant provides biological treatment for sanitary wastewater generated through out the Greenwood Metropolitan District service area.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process to destroy nuisance and pathogenic microorganisms present in the wastewater (i.e., chlorine use as a wastewater disinfectant is an industry standard).  The chlorination process includes chlorine container handling and storage facilities, chlorine feed system (piping, vacuum chlorinators, and injectors), and related safety equipment and instrumentation.  The Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant is manned 8-hours a day and access to the plant site is restricted to authorized personnel.  After hour notification of alarms is through SCADA dial out paging to an operator on call.\n\n3.  General accidental release program and the chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant complies with EPA's RMP rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and with all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorination processes were constructed, and is operated, in accordance with recommendations of the WEF and Chlorine Institute.  The Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n \tHigh level of training for operators and maintenance personnel\n \tEquipment inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance\n \tUse of \"industry standard\" process and safety equipment\n \tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures\n \tPerformance of hazard review of equipment and procedures\n \tImplementation of an internal and external auditing program\n \tSegregation of chemical processes for compatibility"

Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the past five years.  Due to the effectiveness of the  release prevention program, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant has an emergency preparedness plan that is integrated with the LEPC plan.  The Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a mutual aid agreement with the City of Greenwood and Greenwood County HAZMAT Teams to provide emergency response services in the event of a chlorine release.  The plant emergency preparedness plan includes procedures for the notification of offsite mutual aid responders, LEPC, SCDHEC, and the public along with a discussion of actions to be taken in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The plan also addresses first aid and medical treatment.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Greenwood Metropolitan District West Alexander Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant plans to continue to evaluate the regulated process as required under the PSM/RMP standards to ensure safe operations."
