      "SummaryText": "This plant processes cows' milk into cheese and whey products.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant to cool water that removes heat from certain steps of the cheese-making process.  The ammonia is also used to remove heat from the Coolers, which are cold storage rooms where cheese is cooled and stored before shipment from the plant. \r\n\r\nWhile anhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical, it is widely used as an agricultural fertilizer in Idaho.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant because ammonia has an excellent safety record, is exceptionally energy efficient and, unlike some refrigerants, is not harmful to the earth's ozone layer and does not contribute to global warming or air pollution.\r\n\r\nThe plant is currently upgrading and expanding the ammonia refrigeration system.  When that work is completed the system will consist of 5 compressors, 3 condensers, 3 chillers, a receiver, a recirculator and a liquid transfer vessel, 34 evaporators, 2 pumps and associated piping, valves and fittings.\r\n\r\nAs part of this work shutoff valves that will automatically isolate older evaporators are being added to equipment that was installed before such safety devices were in widespread refrigeration use.\r\n\r\nThis plant has ammonia detectors installed in ammonia use areas to automatically shut down part of or all of the ammonia system in the event of an accidental release of ammonia inside the plant.  The entire refrigeration system can also be shut down manually in an emergency by pushing a single button.  An emergency ammonia diffusion system has been installed as an additional safety measure.  This system allows plant personnel or emergency responders to drain the anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system into two tanks of water, in the process converting the hazardous ammonia into aqua ammonia.  In this form the ammonia is much less dangerous and can be disposed of as a fertilizer by applying it to farm fields.\r\n\r\nTo date, th"

      "SummaryText": "ere has never been an accident involving anhydrous ammonia at the Gooding Glanbia Foods plant that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the plant's refrigeration system, it is Glanbia Foods policy to notify the Gooding Rural Fire District and request that the district respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this with the Fire Chief, Mr. Pat Bishop.  We have also met with Gooding County LERC Coordinator, Lori Capps.  Both Mr. Bishop and Ms. Capps have received copies of Glanbia Foods' Emergency Action Plan.  Members of the fire department have inspected the plant's mechanical refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThis facility utilizes International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard for safe operation of mechanical refrigeration systems.  It is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  We, at this facility, believe that we comply with EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System is designed and installed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Mechanical Code and National Electrical Code."
