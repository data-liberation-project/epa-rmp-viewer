We use a combination of release prevention programs and emergency response programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed into and implemented including:\r\nA description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule;\r\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from an accidental chemical release;\r\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\r\nA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule;\r\nAn overview of our emergency response program;\r\nAn overview of planned activities to improve the prevention program at the facility;\r\nThe certification that the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule requires us to provide; and\r\nThe detailed information about our risk management program.\r\n\r\nThe South Plainfield facility is a producer of precious metal products such as silver solder, pastes, and powders used in the electronics industry.  Formaldehyde solution is used at the facility in the precipitation of metallic silver from precious metal solutions.  These operations are conducted in small batch reactors.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde solution, 37%, is stored at the facility in a nominal 6000-gallon storage tank and distributed to the user equipment in the plant through a piping network.  Formaldehyde solution is delivered by tank truck by several different firms.  Deliveries are scheduled when the storage tank level drops below a predetermined level.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Pr"

The standard covers management system elements involving safety information, hazard evaluations, operating procedures, employee training, contractor controls mechanical integrity, pre-startup reviews, incident investigations, safe work practices, and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of specific measures in place to reduce the likelihood of a release of formaldehyde solution or it's impact.  Two level gauges monitor the tank liquid level.  The two gauges must read within 100 gallons of each other.  Additional material is not ordered until the tank level is below 1500 gallons.  This will allow the total contents of the delivery tank trailer to be safely unloaded into the storage tank.  The storage tank is equipped with high level monitor and alarm that alerts the driver if the tank level is too high.\r\n\r\nThe driver and Ferro personnel are on hand throughout the unloading operation and are able to shut down the operation in the event of a leak before a large release has occurs\r\n\r\nThe pipe line and storage tank is constructed of welded stainless steel.  This material is compatible with and resistant to corrosion from formaldehyde solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have not been any releases of formaldehyde solution at this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEmergencies at the facility are handled according to the sites \"Emergency Preparedness Plan\" which details the actions required to respond to plant emergencies such as chemical spills, medical emergencies, fire, gas leaks, bomb threats, explosions and natural disasters.\r\n\r\nDecisions regarding the evacuation of personnel and the notification of outside agencies are made by the Emergency Response Management Team chairperson or Vice Chairperson.
