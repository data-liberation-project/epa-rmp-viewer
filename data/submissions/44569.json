The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in November 2000.  The facility is new and operations are scheduled to commence once the refrigeration system is fully functional.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 4250 S. Fulton Parkway in College Park, Georgia about 3 miles west of the junction of the Interstate 85 and Interstate 285 freeways.  The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some ligh"

The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the thermosyphon  receiver to the high pressure receiver.  The thermosyphon receiver maintains a liquid level that is used for cooling of the compressor oil.  Excess liquid is drained to the high pressure receiver, which supplies liquid to the intermediate temperature and high temperature recirculator vessels.  The intermediate temperature recirculator feeds the low temperature recirculator.  As the ammonia enters each recirculator vessel, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal (high, medium, low) pressure.  Each recirculator supplies overfed pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  The high temperature recirculator  serves sixteen (16) cross dock evaporators.  The medium temperature recirculator serves eight (8) cooler evaporators, and the low temperature recirculator serves four (4) freezer evaporators.
