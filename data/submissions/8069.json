In order to document that commitment, the company has authorized a Health, Safety and Environmental Statement of Policy. \n\nLaws, rules and regulations in the area of health, safety and the environment impose responsibilities on the Company and its employees. An additional purpose of this policy is to set forth the principles, under which those responsibilities are to be fulfilled, thereby providing appropriate protection for employees, as well as the Company.\n\nEmployee Health and Safety\nWorkplace health and safety are of paramount concern.

The releases that HAT has had in the past 5 years are typically very small releases in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\nHAT has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control, and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from outside the facility, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.  The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nAlthough HAT's ERP is specifically written for the HAT facility, the plan is also part of the countywide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nHAT is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.

The selection of the alternative scenario was based on researching information sources for release data.  The EPA Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) database and publications from the AIChE Ammonia Safety Symposia were reviewed.  Informal interviews with terminal operators, supervisors, engineers and managers were conducted. This scenario produces a 0.5-mile distance to the endpoint. This was determined by the use of a computer based modeling program named DEGADIS.\n\nHAT's safety and environmental exemplary record reflects this commitment.

The following covers some of these layers of protection:\n \n7 Managing risks is something we do on a daily basis.\n \n7 We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n \n7 Our employees are highly skilled and well trained.\n\n7 Our equipment is routinely inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n \n7 We have computer monitors and controls in the process throughout our plants to detect potential leaks or releases before they occur.\n \n7 Hazard reviews add another layer of protection.
