The terminal receives, by barge and ship, approximately 175,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia each year, which is stored and transferred by truck and pipeline to various end users. The terminal operates 7 days per week and 24 hours per day.  Operational and maintenance personnel constantly monitor and maintain process equipment. The terminal conducts drills and personal hygiene monitoring to maintain emergency response readiness. HAT maintains the ongoing integrity of the process equipment through preventive maintenance and inspections. Strict guidelines have been established, through the Process Safety Management Regulations, to maintain equipment in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nHAT's worst -case release scenario is the failure of a 15,000-ton ammonia storage tank.

This produces a scenario with a >25-mile distance to the endpoint.  This was determined by the use of EPA's RMP*Comp.\n\nHAT's alternative scenario is the release of 36,000 pounds of ammonia. The selection of the alternative scenario was based on researching information sources for release data.  The EPA Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) database and publications from the AIChE Ammonia Safety Symposia were reviewed.  Informal interviews with terminal operators, supervisors, engineers and managers were conducted. This scenario produces a 0.5-mile distance to the endpoint. This was determined by the use of a computer based modeling program named DEGADIS.\n\nHAT's safety and environmental exemplary record reflects this commitment. We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection in place at our plants to protect our employees and the community. The following covers some of these layers of protection:\n \n7 Managing risks is something we do on a daily basis.\n \n7 We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n \n7 Our employees are highly skilled and well trained.\n\n7 Our equipment is routinely inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n \n7 We have computer monitors and controls in the process throughout our plants to detect potential leaks or releases before they occur.\n \n7 Hazard reviews add another layer of protection.  They involve \"what if\" scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n \n7 Hazard reviews are also conducted at the terminal.\n \n7 Emergency response, including employee responders as well as off-site responders like LEPC, State Police and HAZMAT, add another layer of protection to the community.  \n \n7 We work closely with the police and fire departments, and we "

The releases that HAT has had in the past 5 years are typically very small releases in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\nHAT has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control, and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from outside the facility, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.  The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nAlthough HAT's ERP is specifically written for the HAT facility, the plan is also part of the countywide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nHAT is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.
