Personnel that are not involved in the actual cooling process are trained to notify and evacuate.  Only personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards and the Oxnard Fire/CUPA would respond to an actual release.

The HMBP is filed with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  \n  \n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n- Process Hazard Analysis revalidations/updates\n- Compliance Audits\n- Routine inspections and maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program)\n- IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections\n- WPS Inspection Protocol\n\nThe programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.  Where appropriate service calls are established in parallel to identified needs.  Current planned changes to improve safety include recommendations as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis update performed by an experienced team on January 19th, 2023.

If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at each oil drain point.\n\nOther Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n-  Fencing and gates to limit access by potential \u201cwrong-do-ers\u201d\n-  The facility is equipped with a Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) System   \n-  A monitoring system monitors process parameters 24/7/365\n-  Technicians can access system controls remotely\n-  The alarm system including ammonia alarms is continuously monitored via a third-party security company in addition to direct messaging of Technicians\n- The refrigeration system is equipped with an ammonia-water diffusion system.

As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into a computerized service call system. Tasks are tracked through this system. Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, WPS/Commercial Cooler has reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced release potentials.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\nAs noted above a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established.
