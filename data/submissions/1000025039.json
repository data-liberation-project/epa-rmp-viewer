      "SummaryText": "Columbia Pacific Bio-Refinery, LLC (CPBR) is an ethanol fuel production plant located near Clatskanie, Oregon in Columbia County.   CPBR was previously known as Cascade Grain Products, LLC.  CPBR has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals potentially stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  CPBR will begin operations in late 2011/early 2012.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCPBR is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. CPBR uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make ethanol produced at the facility unfit for human consumption.  CPBR also uses aqueous ammonia for pH control directly in the process; however, the concentration of ammonia used by CPBR is not regulated under 40 CFR 68.  It is the policy of CPBR to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of a significant emergency, including an accidental release of flammable materials, it is the policy of CPBR to notify appropriate authorities and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAs previously mentioned, CPBR's ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (most commonly natural gasoline) to render ethanol produced by the facility unfit for human consumption.   The natural gasoline is stored in an aboveground tank as a liquid under atmospheric pressure and is mixed with ethanol prior to transport.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's on-site tank farm area  which is equipped with secondary containment.   The supply and chemical make-up of denaturant is dependent upon market rates and the source of the natural gasoline, making it difficult for CPBR to foresee with much certainty the specific chemical makeup of its denaturant.  Denaturant used by the ethanol i"

      "SummaryText": "ndustry commonly contains pentane, isopentane, and/or butane in varying percentages.  \n\n\n\nCPBR has chosen to file this RMP predictively in light of the variable nature of the denaturant supply.  CPBR has reviewed a variety of MSDS for denaturant commonly used by the ethanol industry and has prepared this RMP based on a \"worst-case\" scenario (i.e., use of a denaturant with the most highly-concentrated list of regulated substances).  This \"worst-case\" denaturant contains approximately 28 percent isopentane, 25 percent n-pentane, and 3 percent n-butane, all RMP regulated substances. Assuming this scenario, the maximum amount of denaturant on-site would be approximately 192,000 gallons or 1,100,000 pounds (approximately 300,000 pounds isopentane, 260,000 pounds n-pentane and 33,000 pounds n-butane).  \n\n\n\nCPBR has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to the reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. CPBR has coordinated emergency response with local authorities and responding agencies and will conduct periodic drills.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, CPBR has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  A PHA for a variety of hazardous processes at the facility was conducted in September 2011.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nCPBR does not have "

CPBR management is committed to promoting a safe work environment.  CPBR will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol prodcution process in a safe and efficient manner.
