The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Action Plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at any Atlas Cold Sorage facilities, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\n\nThe management believes that cooperative emergency response with company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in will provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all personnel are instructed to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander. \n\nAtlas Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehousing facility. The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators. At this facility, two separate refrigeration systems are currently in use. The Produce Warehouse system has a toal anhydrous ammonia invertory of 7,800 pounds. The Frozen Warehouse refrigeration system contains 16,460 pounds. Although process piping does not interconnect these systems, they a"

      "SummaryText": "re housed in a single structure, separated by a common wall. Given the relatively close proximity of storage vessels for both systems, a catastropohic event involving one system, such as a majopr fire, explosion, or natural disaster, could theoreticlly impart the other. Therefore both systems are considered a single process for purposes of this RMP. The combined total inventory of anhyrous ammonia is 24,260 pounds. There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\nAtlas Cold Storage is committed to safe management and operation of the closed Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maintenance employees are trained to observe operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental release of ammonia at any time.  Should any accidental release occur, all maintenance employees are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental releases.\n\nAs part of Atlas Cold Storage's safety programs, we have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potential emergency response operations and subsequent clean-up and restoration of systems.  Normal operations rely on the following:\n\n\u00d8 The Maintenance Management Procedures are used to perform preventative\n maintenance and to maintain records of all maintenance work performed.  This\n helps to ensure that the closed ammonia system continues to work safely,\n reliably and efficiently in the originally intended manner.\n \n\u00d8 Any set specifications of systems temperature, pressure, level or power \n interruption, that are exceeded or violated will normally trigger an alarm and\n safety shutdown.  Maintenance technicians are notified of a deviation from\n normal opera"

Atlas Cold Storage is in a constant review process of its operations and industry standards to provide a safe working environment for our employees, customers and neighbors."
