The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility.\nAgland Coop  complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the  Craig  Fire Department. and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of our facility and the regulated substance handled.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks is 129136  pounds. \n\n3.  The Worst-case release scenario.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. We are under the supervision of the TIER II - LEPC program.  All of the proper authorities will be called immediately in the event of a toxic release.\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regualtions. The facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administrati"

Five-year accident history.\n\nWe never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia  that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n6.  The emergency response program. \nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Craig Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department: members of the fire department have inspected our system.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n        THE UNDERSIGNED CERTIFIES THAT, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION AND BELIEF, FORMED AFTER REASONABLE INQUIRY, THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS TRUE, ACCURATE, AND COMPLETE.
