      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Gold Signature Foods, LLC frozen specialty foods facility in Monroe, North Carolina.  The facility refrigeration process consists of a two-stage refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.\n\nThe refrigeration system uses approximately 25,000 pounds of ammonia.  A speculative offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as ?worse-case scenario? and ?alternative release scenario?.  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that ?the owner shall assume that the ?maximum quantity in the largest vessel ?is released as a gas over 10 minutes?, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated for the Gold Signature Foods, LLC Monroe Facility has an endpoint distance of approximately 1600 feet.  The Gold Signature Facility is located in an industrial area with minimal residential population for this endpoint distance.\n\nGold Signature Foods, LLC?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:\n\n* Hands-on and classroom training of the operators\n* Preventative maintenance program\n* Up-to-date operating procedures\n* Performance of a process hazard analysis\n* Procedures for handling all changes to the system\n* Pre-startup review procedures for significant system modificat"

      "SummaryText": "ions\n* Process safety information\n* Procedures for investigating release incidents\n* Non-routine safe work permits\n\nNeither accidental release of ammonia resulting in deaths, injuries, or property damage onsite nor offsite have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe Gold Signature Foods, LLC Monroe Facility has an Emergency Response Program that includes an emergency action plan for ammonia release.  This plan includes emergency alarm, posted facility evacuation exit routing, emergency response drills and evaluation, and local Public Safety notification procedures.  The facility also has Security Officers on site at all times, including weekends and holidays.\n\nGold Signature Foods, LLC is a minority-owned facility which specializes in the manufacturing and marketing of frozen foods.  Gold Signature Foods, LLC is committed to providing quality products to the food industry, a quality working experience for our employees, and maintaining and improving the quality of life in our communities and the environment."
