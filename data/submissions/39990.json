      "SummaryText": " Point Breeze is the former ARCO-Atlantic refinery acquired by Sunoco in 1988; the second, Girard Point, is the former Gulf-Chevron refinery acquired in 1994.  Today, it is operated as a fully integrated petroleum refining complex capable of processing 342,000 barrels per day of crude oil into various petroleum products including: gasoline, home and industrial heating fuels, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), residual fuel and a number of petrochemicals such as benzene, propylene, and cumene.  \n\nThe types of processing units in operation at the refinery include: atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, distillate desulfurization, alkylation, sulfur recovery, petrochemical recovery, and gasoline treating and blending.  In support of these processes, the refinery also operates steam generation, water treating, wastewater treatment, tank car and truck loading facilities and numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks.  \n\nSunoco also owns and operates the 211-acre Schuylkill River Tank Farm (SRTF) located on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite the refinery property.  The facility functions as a product storage and shipping area and contains no refining units.  On-site are numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks, an API-type separator, gasoline blending facilities, and an LPG tank car and truck loading area.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nCHEMICAL                       USE\nHydrogen Fluoride (HF)      Alkylation Unit Catalyst\n\nFlammables\n\nCHEMICAL                                         USE\nPropane                                              Commercial Fuel\nButane                                                Gasoline Blending\nIsobutane                                            Gasoline Blending/Intermediate Fee"

Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an \"our\" attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process v"

PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \n\n     5. Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of "

Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n     6. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n     7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Philadelphia Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Manag"

Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review confirms items such as: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n      9. Compliance Audits\n\nThe refinery Process Safety Coordinator is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a corporate audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n     10. Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additiona"

Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n     12. Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.  The safety regulations require contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery. The program also includes a refinery overview video that is shown to all contractor employees to familiarize them with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.\n\n     13.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had five accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. The accidents are deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in onsite personnel injuries that required medical treatment, resulted in significant property damage onsite or resulted in property damage offsite.  No offsite injuries occurred due to these incidents. For each of these incidents, we have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the events and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The following is a brief summary of these incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn April 4, 2003, while removing a blind from a feed line (which was thought to be empty) to a propane bullet, a mechanic experienced a burn to his thigh when liquid propane was discharged.  The incident investigation showed the cause of the release was a leaking inlet valve that had leaked propane downstream of the valve to the area of the blind.   After this incident, all leaking inlet valves to the propane bullets were replaced and a new valve was installed to give the option to safely isolate the feed lines to the propane bullets in the future.  Also, investigation results, as well as safe work practices when working on jobs with multiple lines, were reviewed with operations and maintenance personnel.\n\nOn January 18, 2003, low fuel gas pressure caused the flame in a heater to blow out.

No employees or contractors were injured during the event.  The incident investigation revealed the fuel gas controller was poorly winterized, no operating procedures existed to address the specific situation encountered, and that refinery safety standards had not been followed.  Following the investigation, all refinery operating procedures were reviewed to ensure that all units with heaters had emergency procedures to cover this situation, all emergency shutoff valve bypasses were car sealed closed (per company safety standards), and a standard winterization checklist was developed for all operating areas (which included likely and repetitive freeze up spots).\n \nOn December 23, 2000, a seal balance line on a hydrogen compressor became dislodged releasing a mixture of hydrogen and light hydrocarbons that resulted in an explosion and fire, causing significant onsite property damage.  No employees or contractors were injuried during the event. The incident investigation showed the cause of the release was an improperly installed fitting and subsequent inadequate maintenance activities and procedures that resulted in a compressor fitting failure, causing the seal balance line to become dislodged.  Following the investigation, refinery maintenance procedures were updated to include installation and inspection of compressor fittings, maintenance training was updated, and an audit was completed of all refinery compressors to identify and correct similar situations. \n\nOn June 30, 2000, piping between two exchangers failed releasing a combination of hydrogen and hydrocarbon vapor that resulted in a vapor-cloud explosion and fire, causing significant onsite property damage as well as offsite property damage.

Since the investigation, all similar piping in the process has been replaced with piping of a different metallurgy that is resistant to degradation in High Temperature Hydrogen service.  Additional safeguards put in place include installing temperature indicators to improve monitoring of the exchangers, modification to operating procedures, and retraining operators on the purpose of the exchangers.  Lastly, a review of all process piping in the refinery in High Temperature Hydrogen service was performed to ensure the correct metallurgy is being used.\n\nOn February 2, 2000, operators were attempting remove a gate valve in Hydrofluoric Acid / Hydrocarbon service, after the system, which the valve was a part of, was purged.  As operators attempted to place the valve in the open position prior to removing it, material sprayed out of the valve and came into contact with an operator's face.  The operator was immediately treated and sent to the hospital where he was admitted overnight for observation.  The incident investigation revealed the material had been trapped under the seat of the valve or in the valve body due to scale formation around the valve stem.  As a result of the investigation, this valve and other valves in similar service were replaced with a \"Durco\" type plug valves, operators were trained in the inherent-risk associated with gate valves and the good operating practices that should be used when opening them, and refinery safety standards were revised to upgrade the Personal Protective Equipment utilized on the Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit.\n\n\nD.
