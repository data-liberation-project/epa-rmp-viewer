All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Lower Poplar Street WRF utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before it is returned to the Ocmulgee River.  Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation and electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical ?toxic endpoint?.  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as ?the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.?  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe Lower Poplar Street WRF Risk Management plan includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n\n?    Operator Training\n?    Preventive Maintenance Program\n?    Process Specific Safety Equipment\n?    Safe and Effective Standard Operating Procedures\n?    Hazard Review of Equipment and Procedures\n?    Auditing and Inspection Programs\n?    Comprehensive Management Program\n\nThe Lower Poplar Street WRF has an active environ"

Personal Protective Equipment Program\n\nThe Lower Poplar Street WRF has a written Emergency Response Plan, which has been coordinated with the City of Macon and Bibb County Fire Department which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and facility tours will be conducted bi-annually, at which time emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed.\n\nThe Lower Poplar Street WRF takes a pro-active approach to risk management and emergency response through continuous joint training sessions between the facility employees and local response agencies.  These preventive measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of timely emergency response to potential chlorine incidents."
