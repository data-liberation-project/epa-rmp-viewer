Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia\tand  propane \tis / are stored at the facility in two (2) anhydrous ammonia tanks of 12,000 gallon capacity and one (1) propane tank of 18,000 gallons capacity. The maximum quantity stored of anhydrous ammonia is (85% of 12,000 gal. X 5.1 lbs / gal )104,040 lbs and  ( 85% of 18,000 gal.

The maximum quantity released would be 104,040  pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.1 miles.  \n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.
