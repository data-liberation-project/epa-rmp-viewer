Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at the Arvin Facility are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  Substance 1 is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant. We have a total quantity of 86,964 lbs. broken up into three smaller systems the first is Bldg. 1 with a total quantity of 22,805 lbs. The second is Bldg. 3 with a total of 45,183 lbs. The third system is Bldg. 4 with a total of 18,976 lbs. Substance 2 is Chlorine used for water treatment in our plant this substance is broken up into two systems the first is Bldg. 3 with 2,000 lbs. and the second is Bldg. 4 with 12,000 lbs. \n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \n\n\n\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conduction activities within our covered processes, the Arvin Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  \n\n\n\nTraining: \n\nThe Grimmway Arvin Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as necessary. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Arvin Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to ensue proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available from the manufacturer, the International of Amm"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Arvin Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nArvin Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nArvin Facility promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.
