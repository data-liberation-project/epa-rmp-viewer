Our facility is located in a rural community in Oceana County Michigan where we process quality frozen fruits and vegetables with the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Arbre Farms Corp. uses this refrigerant to IQF (Individual Quick Freeze) the many different types of fruits and vegetables at our facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia is calculated and is located onsight. This refrigerant is stored in a secure, restricted area where access is only gained by the appropriate personnel.\nArbre Farms Corp. has established policies and procedures that provide ongoing evaluation of practices, compliance, effectiveness, scope and relevance. Routine Regulatory, Customer, and Internal audits, aid in ensuring all procedures and policies are honored and up to date. Our Quality Assurance department is intently focused on establishing Policies, Standard Operating Procedures and Work Instructions to assure that operations are performed within the facility to the highest possible standards of Food Quality and Safety. \nThe Company's personnel are to be trained in all relevant procedures and provided the necessary resources to ensure the achievement of the Company's Mission Statement. Safety, with regards to our employees as well as our products, is of the utmost importance to Arbre Farms Corporation. Training practices are strictly designed to ensure all employees are aware of their responsibility to maintain the safety of themselves and fellow employees. \nArbre Farms Corp. has established a Food Safety and Security Committee whose job is to conduct periodic internal Chemical Risk Assessment Audits to ensure personnel safety along with the safety of the Community.

Our facility has a tried and proven PM (Preventative Maintenance) program which it implements to keep operations safe and efficient. Our Operators use the documentation from the PM program to identify any possible problems before they become a serious concern. Every piece of our ammonia system is checked on a regular basis with the proper PM to keep things running as smooth as possible. Should an incident arise our Operators have all been properly trained and certified by GCAP (Garden City Ammonia Program) located in Garden City, Kansas. Our facility has warning systems in place to warn personnel of a potential problem before a situation gets out of hand. There are emergency shut-offs along with placards in place to designate the best shut-off points should need be. These placards are for the isolation of the pieces of equipment involved in the ammonia system and can easily be read from a distance. \nArbre Farms Corp. works with our local emergency services to coordinate facility updates and training. If a release is identified, the Walkerville Area Fire and Rescue will be dispatched. The Walkerville Area Rescue will determine the amount of medical response personnel and transport unit that will be needed and the Central Dispatch will be notified. \nWe are continually developing recommendations as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, and review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. As the data from these recommendations are generated they shall be discussed and implemented if data shows the necessary changes are need."
