Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\nFrederickson Power in Tacoma, Washington handles aqua ammonia that is considered hazardous by EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.   Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nFrederickson Power?s emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the Washington Department of Ecology, and the National Response Center.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe primary purpose of the generating station is to produce electric power from combustion of natural gas.  Aqua ammonia is used at the facility to reduce the concentration of oxides of nitrogen (N0x) produced during combustion.  Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid in one storage tank.  The aqua ammonia is pumped to an evaporator and then injected into the combustion system where it reacts with the natural gas combustion products to reduce N0x concentrations.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is aqua ammonia.  The maximum amount of aqua ammonia that can be stored at this station is 12,000 gallons or 91,090 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWorst-Case S"

      "SummaryText": "cenario\n?The worst-case release scenario as defined by EPA is the release of the full contents of the largest ammonia storage vessel within 10 minutes with simultaneous failure of all control and mitigation systems and at a time when weather conditions would cause the maximum downwind transport distance.  At Frederickson Power, the worst-case release would be a catastrophic failure of the aqua ammonia storage tank when filled to capacity.  This worst-case scenario would release 91,090 pounds of aqua ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor within 10 minutes of the failure.\n?The distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14mg/l ammonia for this worst-case scenario is 0.2 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario\n?The more realistic alternative-case release would be the failure of a 1/2-inch diameter aqua ammonia pipeline.  This scenario would result in a total release of 720 pounds of aqua ammonia. \n?The distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14mg/l ammonia for this alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n \n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nFrederickson Power complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable aqua ammonia storage and handling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the aqua ammonia system are thoroughly trained using Frederickson Power?s documented training program.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases of aqua ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life of this facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\nFrederickson Power?s emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of aqua ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the Pierce County Emergency Management and the local Fire Department."
