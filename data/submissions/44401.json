      "SummaryText": "The Airgas-North Central Galesburg facility, owned and operated by Airgas, \r\nIncorporated is located at 252 W. 6th Street, Galesburg, IL. 61401.  The management and employees of the Galesburg facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of MAPP (Methylacetylene-Propadiene/Propylene/Propane Mixture).  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Galesburg operation is a MAPP Methylacetylene-Propadiene/Propylene/Propane Mixture) storage and distribution facility which is generally unmanned.  When manned, the facilities primary operation is the distribution, unloading of MAPP (Methylacetylene-Propadiene/Propylene/Propane Mixture) from railcars (35,000 gal/144,700 lb.) in two 18,000 gal (73,400 lb.) high pressure ASME storage tanks.  The MAPP is then transfilled into DOT approved road tankers and distributed to customers. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA\u00bfs definition for a flammable gas release, and the Alternative Release Scenario is also based on EPA criteria for a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  Results and other information can be reviewed by contacting the facility. \r\nThe impacted area was determined using \u00bfLand View V\u00bf.\r\n\r\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system.  These would reduce the likelihood of a release itself.  These include check valves in the fill lines, Excess Flow Valves, grounding equipment, rupture disks, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and testing of the tanks.\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of MAPP in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Part 68, Program Level #2.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participa"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), which assists management and employees in making decisions from improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of MAPP.  The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process.  The \r\nPHA was reviewed and updated in October 2003 and will be updated at least every 5 years.\r\n\r\nDetailed Operating procedures exist, which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were reviewed in July 2003 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\r\n\r\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in \r\nOSHA\u00bfs Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  \r\nTraining includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response, safety rules and procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization, and other pertinent process safety information.  Employees trained have a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.

The employees are periodically evaluated to ensure them posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews.  The training program was last reviewed on October 2003.\r\n\r\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.  The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor\u00bfs safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor\u00bfs safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified.  The contractor\u00bfs safety procedures were last reviewed in October 2003.\r\n\r\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.  Equipment used to store, process, or handle acetylene has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria fro acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.  This program was reviewed in October 2003.\r\n\r\nHazardous work or non-routine work is controlled in a consistent manner.

This Program was reviewed in October 2003 for both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include modifications for equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind.  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.
