This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators and licensed refrigeration contractors are permitted to perform system operations.  DOT Foods, Inc. has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nDOT Foods, Inc. is located at 1120 W. North St. in Vidalia, Georgia.  The facility is approximately 10 feet south of Highway 292 and 223 feet (0.04 miles) south of the Seaboard Coastline Railroad.  The area surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light business and residential areas.\r\n\r\nThe DOT Foods, Inc. ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1990.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 17,269 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers and the Thermosyphon Receiver are mounted on the roof above the machine room.  Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nDOT Foods, Inc. has developed an accidenta"

In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will coordinate response procedures by contacting the Vidalia Fire Department.  Ammonia sensors are present in the machine room, in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  \r\n\r\nEmployees within the building are to shelter in place or evacuate to a point upwind of the facility.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nPHA's and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  DOT Foods, Inc. has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."

These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nDOT Foods, Inc. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.
