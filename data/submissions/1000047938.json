Vernon Plant is located on approximately forty-two acres on the north side of the city of Vernon, Wilbarger County, Texas. The property is bounded on the north by the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Railway, on the west by Harrison Street, on the south by Sullivan Street, and on the  east by the acreage of private landowners.  This land is in two sections bisected by the Texas Department of Transportation ditch which eventually empties into the Pease River which is located approximately two miles north and east of the plant site.  The North thirty five acres contain all plant processes, storage and waste water treatment facilities.  Runoff water and/or a possible spill is channeled to a nominal 500,000 gallon concrete basin to catch the first flush of possibly contaminated rain water or emergency use water (ie., deluge, fire hydrant/sprinkler, etc.)  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\r\n\r\nThe Vernon Plant is required to comply with the Solvay USA Inc. Process Hazard Management Program (PHMP).  PHMP meets or exceeds the minimum requirements as listed in 29CFR1910.119 OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard for the same regulated substance - Propylene Oxide - that is also covered by the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 A&reg; or as more commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program.\r\n\r\nThe Vernon Plant conducts periodic self-assessments (audits) of the PHMP and develops action plans to ensure prompt correction to any deficiencies noted during these self-assessments.\r\n\r\nSolvay USA Inc PHMP includes the following 16 elements:\r\n\r\n               1.  Unit Safety Files\r\n               2.  Employee Participation \r\n               3.  Process Safety Information for Chemicals\r\n               4.

Propylene Oxide, the only substance on the plant site that is regulated by the RMP rule.  Propylene Oxide is delivered by railcar approximately 2 times/week.Vernon may have as many as 3 railcars containing propylene oxide onsite, in addition to two permanent above ground storage tanks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to propylene oxide, the Vernon Plant also uses other non-regulated chemicals in it's processes to manufacture a variety of products, both derivatized and non-derivatized, that are sold to a number of different industries which include, but are not limited to, the following;  oil field chemicals, textiles, mining, food, cosmetics and fire fighting industries.\r\n\r\nPropylene oxide is an extremely flammable liquid, that if released becomes an immediate fire hazard.  It is clear and colorless and has an ether like odor to it.  It will react with strong acids, bases, peroxides, anhydrous metal chlorides, copper and its alloys, brass, bronze and other type acetylide forming metals.  Overexposure may cause;  severe eye irritation, irritation to the respiratory tract and other mucous membranes, immediate irritation and blistering of the skin.
