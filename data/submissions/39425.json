Main\nSayre OK 73664\n(580) 928-3590\n\n\nSayre Crop & Farm Services, Inc.\n\n\nFor further information contact: Larry Browning\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n   The owners, management, and employees of Sayre Crop & Farm Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n  -  The primary activity is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n  -  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop nutrients.\n\n  -  The maximum quantity stored would be 90,000 pounds in one - 18,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n  A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 90,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 20 ppm) is .89 miles.\n\n  B.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n   The facility has implemented the prevision of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health"

There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   -  have caused and deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n   - to our knowledge, have resulted in the offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response  Program.\n\n   -  The facility has:\n\n    a.  Written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n    c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including the pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n   Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodical evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
