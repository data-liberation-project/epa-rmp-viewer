The toxic endpoints used for each RMP Process are the following:\n\nPhosphorus Oxychloride RMP Process:     0.003 mg/L (0.5 ppm); basis IDLH\nHydrochloric Acid Reagent RMP Process:  0.03 mg/L (20 ppm); basis ERPG-2\nAqueous Ammonia RMP Process:              0.14 mg/L (200 ppm); basis ERPG-2\n\nPPLLC-A also conducted OCAs for hypothetical alternative releases for the Phosphorus Oxychloride and Hydrochloric Acid Reagent RMP Processes.  Both alternative release scenarios are less severe than the worst-case but more likely to occur and have been selected using data from incidents that have occurred in similar processes.  The alternative release scenario for the Phosphorus Oxychloride RMP Process assume a continuous leak of POCl3 occurring for 120 minutes, where all the material is spilled forming a pool and evaporates.  The OCA predicts an impact radius extending 0.3 miles from the point of the release, determined using a GPS.  Though this distance impacts off-site areas, no public or environmental receptors would be affected.  The Hydrochloric Acid Reagent RMP Process alternative release scenario assumes a continuous leak of HCl Reagent where all the material is spilled in the storage tank\u00bfs dike forming a pool that evaporates.  The release duration is approximately 58 hours.  The OCA predicts an impact radius extending 0.2 miles from the point of the release, also determined using a GPS.  This distance slightly impacts off-site areas, and thus no public or environmental receptors would be affected.\n\nAll alternative release scenarios assume the following atmospheric conditions: wind speed of 3 m/s, atmospheric stability class D, urban topography, air temperature of 77\u00b0F, and a relative humidity of 50%, i"

The toxic endpoints used for the worst-case release scenarios were also used for the alternative release scenarios.\n\nAs mentioned above, since there has not been any release of a regulated substance from the Aqueous Ammonia RMP Process over the past five years which have resulted in off-site death or injury or may have led to response or restoration for activities for the environment, and the worst-case OCA demonstrates that there can be no off-site consequences in terms of human health and safety, the Aqueous Ammonia RMP Process is eligible for Prevention Program 1.  As such, no alternate release scenario OCA is required.  The RM-Plan for Program 1 processes is simply comprised of registration information, a demonstration that in the event of a worst-case release that no off-site public receptors are affected, and that emergency response can be coordinated between the facility and off-site first-responders. Program 1 also requires that any environmental receptors within the worst-case impact zone be identified.  This RM-Plan provides the above required information, as part of its certification.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM [40CFR \u00a768.155(f)]\n\nPPLLC-A maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the public, and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance.     The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities.  In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment, as well as instructions and training that govern use of the equipment.

This commitment is demonstrated through the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of manufacturing and related processes.  Among other policies, PPLLC-A's maintains several programs, measures, procedures, and other tools focused in the prevention of acute catastrophic events, such as accidental chemical releases, fires, explosions or unexpected process upsets from strong exothermic reactions or the release of large volumes of gas.  However, if a release does occur, PPLLC-A's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release to the maximum possible level.\n\nIn a continuous effort to meet and surpass regulatory requirements, PPLLC-A management systems have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [40 CFR \u00a768.155(b)]\n\nPPLLC-A, formerly named Pharmacia & Upjohn Caribe Inc. (P&UCI) is dedicated to the manufacture of pharmaceutical and chemical bulk products.  Certain processes at the facility are subject to the RMP Rule.  As such, PPLLC-A has developed and implemented a RMP, and submitted a timely Risk Management Plan (RM-Plan) for several cov"

On March 2003, the facility submitted a revision of its RM-Plan due to the substitution of anhydrous ammonia by aqueous ammonia.\n\nThe two covered processes contained in the 1999 RMP included three chemicals: anhydrous ammonia; hydrochloric acid with concentrations of 37% by weight or more (HCl Reagent); and phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3).  The March 2003 revision to the initial RM-Plan eliminated the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia due to the permanent shutdown of the fermentation process and introduced the storage and use of aqueous ammonia for the manufacturing of Valdecoxib.  Another product, Linezolid that previously used aqueous ammonia stored and handled in tote tanks and in amounts less than the RMP Rule threshold quantity for the material, was also included in the RMP to eliminate the use of the tote tanks and use the same aqueous ammonia storage and distribution system set up for the Valdecoxib manufacturing process.\n\nThis revised RM-Plan is being submitted pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768.190(b)(4) due to the increment in the storage capacity and the use of a regulated substance (HCl Reagent) above its RMP Rule threshold quantity for the manufacturing of several active pharmaceutical ingredients that previously used HCl in concentrations below 37% by weight.  For the increment in the storage capacity of HCl Reagent, PPLLC-A will use a tank that actually stores HCl in concentrations below 37% by weight.  Since both storage tanks will be interconnected, the storage capacity and the amount considered for the offsite consequence analyses also increment.  The main purpose of the change is to use HCl Reagent in several other processes currently using HCl in concentrations below 37% due to limited of stocks of this last material in Puerto Rico.  After the change, in addition to the Clindamycin Phosphate Process that already uses HCl Reagent, the following processes will use the material: Linezolid, Tolterodi"

Since all these processes already used HCl (Con. below 37% by weight) and thus were subject to the Process Safety Management requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, the change will not require additional changes to the HCl distribution systems already in place.  In addition, according to the material safety data sheets, the hazards associated with the storage, handling, and use of the HCl Reagent are the same as the HCl to be substituted.\n\nIn addition to the change for the HCl Reagent, PPLLC-A has reorganized its RMP Process definitions.  Previous versions of the RM-Plan and the RMP referenced the name of the manufacturing processes because the substances were used only by specific manufacturing processes.  In order to ease the understanding of the new RMP and since only one HCl Reagent storage and distribution system will be operated, PPLLC-A has named the RMP Processes with the names of the RMP-covered substances and has grouped the manufacturing processes subject to the RMP Rule into the relevant RMP Processes defined.\n\nAs a result, this RM-Plan presents three RMP Processes:\n\nPhosphorus Oxychloride RMP Process: Includes the storage and handling of POCl3 stored in 55-gallon capacity drums and its use in the Clindamycin Phosphate Manufacturing Process.  This RMP Process is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements because it is subject to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standards and has the worst-case offsite consequences.\n\nHydrochloric Acid Reagent RMP Process: Includes the storage of HCl Reagent in two interconnected storage tanks with capacities of 10,000 and 7,500 gallons.  Emissions from these tanks are controlled by a caustic scrubber.  The process also includes the piping and instrumentation systems for the distribution of the HCl Reagent and the use of the material in the Clindamycin Phosphate, Lincomycin HCl, Linezolid, Tolterodine-L-Tartrate, Clindamycin Palmitate, Exemestane, and Clindamycin"

The analysis was conducted following the Hazard Assessment applicable requirements of 40 CFR Subpart B and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analyses (EPA-550-B-99-009 of April 1999).  As a result, the Phosphorus Oxychloride RMP Process would have the worst-case consequences on the environment and the public health.  The analysis also showed that the Hydrochloric Acid Reagent RMP Process would have offsite consequences and that the Aqueous Ammonia RMP Process would not.  Based on the results, PPLLC-A conducted two alternative release scenario OCA\u00bfs: one for the Phosphorus Oxychloride RMP Process and another for the Hydrochloric Acid Reagent RMP Process.  The RMP Rule does not require an alternative release scenario OCA for the Aqueous Ammonia RMP Process because it would not have offsite consequences in the worst-case OCA.\n\nAll OCA\u00bfs were conducted using EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp(TM) Software Ver. 1.07 and the offsite receptors and the population were estimated using LandView\u00ae 5, in addition to Puerto Rico maps, as well a knowledge of the area surrounding the PPLLC-A site.
