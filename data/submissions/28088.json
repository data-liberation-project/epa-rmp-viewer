If an emergency were to occur, the Peoria County Emergency Services and Timber Hollis Fire Department will be notified and requested to respond.  Ameren CILCO Edwards Station minimizes, where possible, the storage and use of highly hazardous chemicals in our facility.  When highly hazardous chemicals are required for our processes, facility management is expected to ensure the safety of Ameren CILCO Edwards Station associates and protection of the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nAmeren CILCO Edwards Station operates a 772 MW coal-fired electric generating facility located approximately 1 1/2 miles south of Bartonville in Peoria County.  The facility has installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on the Unit #3 coal-fired boiler to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to achieve compliance with federal limits.  Anhydrous ammonia will be used in the SCR process and will be stored in two 30,000 gallon (142,000 pound - 85% capacity) above ground storage tanks.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is a release of the entire contents (142,000 pounds) of one of the anhydrous ammonia tanks within a ten-minute period.  The RMP-Comp program (version 1.06) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (0.14 mg/L).  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint was 6.9 miles based on the mandated assumptions of a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec, an atmospheric stability class of F, and using a rural setting.\n\nBased on 2000 census data obtained from the U. S. Census web site for Peoria and Tazwell Counties, the estimated residential population located within the 6.9 mile radius is 70,000.\n\nTo minimize the potential that this worst-case release would occur, Ameren CILCo Edwards Station will store the anhydrous ammonia in ASME approved pressure vessels.

      "SummaryText": "torage tanks will be regularly inspected as part of the facility's accident prevention program.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAmeren CILCO Edwards Station selected a pipeline leak as the most realistic release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia system.  This scenario is based on a complete rupture of a 2-inch pipeline.  Ameren CILCO Edwards Station estimates that the valves needed to stop the flow from the tank would be closed within a maximum of ten (10) minutes.\n\nWith these assumptions, and using the USEPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, Chapter 7, Formula 7-1, the estimated ammonia release rate during this scenario is 675 pounds per minute.  The RMP-Comp program (version 1.06) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for this release rate and duration.  Atmospheric stability class D was assumed for this scenario with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, relative humidity of 50%, and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The topography for the scenario was rural.  The results of the EPA's RMP*Comp model indicated that the endpoint would be reached at a distance of 0.50 miles from the facility and approximately 50 residents would be affected.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains compliance with OSHA Standard 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\".  Also, Ameren CILCO Edwards Station has received assistance from the supplier regarding proper practices for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and employee training.  In addition, the anhydrous storage and transfer system was designed pursuant to ANSI K61.1 guidelines.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the system is new, there have been no reportable releases or accidents.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency, personnel are expected to meet at a designated area for accountability and to then evacuate the facility.  The Operations Shift Supervisor will contact the Peoria County Emergency"

Ameren CILCO will contact the Peoria County Emergency Services & Disaster Agency and the Peoria County Haz Mat Team once construction of the SCR system is complete to invite them to visit the facility.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Risk Management/Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Program for this facility has been developed to ensure compliance with all local, state and federal regulations and to provide guidance for emergency situations involving the anhydrous ammonia storage system.  This program will be reviewed on an annual basis and revisions will be made as necessary."
