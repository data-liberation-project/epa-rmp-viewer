      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Elgin Water Department?s (EWD) Airlite water treatment plant (Airlite facility) stores and uses several water treatment chemicals, of which chlorine and ammonia are regulated toxic substances in accordance with the Chemical Accident Prevention regulations (40 CFR 68). The Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements (Subpart G of Part 68) apply if a regulated substance is present in a process at the facility above its listed threshold quantity (TQ). The chlorine and ammonia (20 percent [%] or greater concentration) TQs are 2,500 and 20,000 pounds (lb), respectively. \n\nAt the Airlite facility, a maximum of 110 gallons of aqueous ammonia solution (approximately 29% solution) is stored in two 55-gallon barrels. In accordance with the interpretation of the applicability threshold for regulated substances in solution (Vol. 62. No. 164, page 45135 dated August 25, 1997), the quantity of ammonia stored is less than the 20,000 lb TQ. Therefore, an RMP submittal for the ammonia solution stored at Elgin?s Airlite facility is not needed. The Airlite facility does, however, store chlorine in one-ton cylinders (maximum inventory is seven [7] cylinders), which exceeds the TQ and triggers the need for development of a risk management program and preparation of a RMP for the Airlite facility.\n\nThe Airlite facility's chlorine storage is not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard because the facility is located in a state (Illinois) without a delegated OSHA program and the state has not incorporated the federal OSHA PSM standard by reference into state law or regulations. Secondly, the facility?s Chlorine process has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code (22130 ? Water Supply and Irrigation Systems) that is not one of the NAICS codes specified under 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). Therefore, the Airlite facility?s Chlorine process does not qualify as a Program 3 process. \n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " Airlite facility's worst-case accidental release modeling indicates that the distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine does extend beyond the Airlite property and would affect the surrounding public receptors, indicating that the Airlite facility?s process cannot be classified as Program 1. Not being classified as either Program 3 or Program 1, the Airlite facility is, by default, classified as Program 2 subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68.12(c). The City of Elgin Water Department has implemented a Program 2 prevention program, conducted off-site consequence analysis and prepared an RMP for the Ailite facility that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Subpart G. The RMP will be revised and updated at least every five (5) years after its initial submission or the date of the most recent update, whichever is later in accordance with 40 CFR 68.190.\n\nPrevention and Mitigation\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The chlorine storage and delivery system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable industry standards and state laws. Based on facility records and interviews with the Water Plant Superintendent, no reportable accidental release of chlorine has taken place at the facility in Elgin, Illinois over the past five (5) years. A reportable accidental release from a covered process is one which results in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or which results in known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage (40 CFR 68.42). The prevention program at the Airlite facility includes the following: (1) compiling and maintaining safety information related to the chlorine process; (2) conducting hazard review associated with chlorine and ammonia storage process and procedures; (3) preparing and updating written operating procedures for safe conduct of activities associated with each covered process; (4) pro"

In 2003, the Airlite facility was equipped with a Purafil? emergency chlorine scrubber system - Model FOCl. This emergency gas scrubber is designed to meet or exceed the requirements of the 1997 Uniform Fire Code, Section 80. The scrubber operates by chemical neutralization of chlorine in the air stream as it passes through media beds, which are chemically impregnated to absorb and react with chlorine to produce a stable salt. The scrubber is sized such that the total quantity of media in the packed tower is more than sufficient to remove the entire contents of a single one-ton cylinder of chlorine. The emergency chlorine scrubber system is activated by a computerized control system. A chlorine sensor is located within the chlorine storage and feed rooms. If the chlorine concentration inside the chlorine storage or feed rooms reaches 1 part per million (ppm), the system activates an audible alarm and a yellow flashing light and provides notification to the control room via the computer system. Upon activation of the alarm, the system will start the scrubber fan to remove the air from the room through an exhaust air duct to the chlorine scrubber unit and the air dampers will open to all"

Airlite facility employees may respond to the emergency accidental release themselves, based on the severity of the release, in accordance with the Elgin Water Department?s Chlorine Leak Emergency Response Procedures, which is included in EWD?s Hazardous Material Emergency Response Procedures (EWD-HMERP). If there is a minor leak that is easily controlled, the facility?s employees are instructed to repair the leak immediately and report the leak to their supervisor. If the leak is major, the person first discovering the leak will call or assign someone to contact the Elgin Fire Department and the supervisor if not already at the scene. If chlorine is entering or has entered the building, a chlorine emergency will be announced over the public address system (intercom) and an evacuation will take place."
