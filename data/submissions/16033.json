Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDPC Industries, Inc (DPC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility  It is our policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies   Safety is an essential part of our operations, the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDPC is a 52-year-old company whose primary activities encompass distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment products For example, chlorine is used to produce sodium hypochlorite commonly know as household bleach  We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and operate more than 20 plants across the United States\n \nWe have these regulated substances at our facility: Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous)  DPC transfers and/or stores these materials in 150-lb cylinders, and ton containers for use by our customers\n\nThe maximum inventories of these substances at this facility are:\n\nChlorine  - 1,200,000 lbs\nSulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - 750,000 lbs\n\n3.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 noti"
