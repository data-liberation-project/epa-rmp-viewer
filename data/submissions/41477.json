      "SummaryText": "THE CITY OF SALISBURY WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \r\n12-9-04\r\n\r\n1.\tThe City of Salisbury Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has developed an Emergency Response Plan which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management standard and the US EPA's Emergency Response Plan.  The plan provides employees guidance on what to do in case of a chemical discharge emergency.  \r\n\r\n\tWWTP Leadership plans to fully update and implement all portions of the \tPlan as soon as possible.  Our near term goals include:\r\n\tContinue training our personnel for a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide leak/chemical emergency\r\n\tContinue Plan coordination efforts with the Wicomico County Emergency Services (LEPC).  A table top Haz-Mat Team drill is projected for April 2005.  A field Haz-Mat Team drill is projected for May 2005.  Representatives of the LEPC, City Fire Department, and City Water Division leadership met, with the above dates for drills being projected.  \r\n\r\nThe original in - house Haz - Mat Team proved to be impractical, due to \tthe followed issues:  \r\n\r\n\tHaz - Mat Team staffing requirements exceeded available WWTP personnel.  \r\n\tGuaranteed Workmen's Compensation injury coverage, through the Heart and Lung Law was not available for our personnel. \r\n\r\n\tNow that the City Fire Department (FD) has formed a Haz - Mat Team, we \tare revising the Plan to incorporate their assistance:\r\n\r\n\tIn the event of a leak, the FD will be contacted to provide Haz - Mat Team response.  The LEPC will be contacted as well. \r\n\tWWTP Leadership/personnel will act as liaison to the FD Command and Control.  \r\n\tAll other WWTP personnel will be evacuated.   \r\n\r\n2.\tThe City of Salisbury WWTP now treats approximately 5.5 million gallons per day of wastewater.  \r\n\t\r\n3.

A previous user recommended against installing the system. They experienced excessive pressure being placed on the tank valves, when closing occurred.  They ultimately removed the system from use. \r\n\r\n8.\tThe Chlorination/Dechlorination system will be removed from service within the next three years.
