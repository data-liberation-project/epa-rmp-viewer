      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufactures textile material which is supplied to other facilities for use in tire manufacturing.  Formaldehyde (37% solution) is an ingredient in a textile treatment dip solution which is applied to a woven fabric.  The formaldehyde process consists of one 5,000 gallon storage tank and associated equipment, which are located inside the manufacturing building.\n\nPrevention & Emergency Response Policy:\nThis facility complies with 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule), and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency involving formaldehyde were to occur it is our policy to notify the Scottsville Fire Department if outside assistance is necessary. \n\nWorst-care Release Scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario is the release of the entire formaldehyde storage container.  In this scenario, the release would be mitigated by the dike and the building.  Using EPA's RMP Comp program, we determined that under these conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.10 miles.  Since the toxic endpoint distance is very limited due to the preventive measures that have been installed, even this worst-case scenario would not affect nearby public receptors.  Please note:  due to a problem with this software, the actual release rate of 0.02 could  not be reported as such.  Instead a default of 0.2 was recorded. \n\nPrevention Program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Rick Management rule and OShA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  Additionally, the storage tank and process are located inside the building to prevent releases to the environment.  The process is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA's PSM and good engineering practices.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nThis facility has never had an accident involiving formaldehyde that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place"
