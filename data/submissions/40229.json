The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n?     Increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergency response    and mitigation procedures when handling an acutely hazardous material (AHM).\n\n?     Assist Soledad Energy LLC and the local governmental agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling an AHM.\n\n     This document addresses the existing AHM system used for the emission control process at the Soledad Energy LLC facility.  The AHM used at the facility and for the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The devices that store and distribute the ammonia will be the subject of investigation throughout this RMP document.\n\n     SOLEDAD ENERGY LLC.  is located within the city limits of Soledad, California, in a predominately business/industrial area, and is an electric co-generation facility.   The facility was first constructed on this site in the early 1990's.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as an emission control agent to control NOx emissions from the biomass fired electric generator,  and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site .   The facility consists of the co-generation plant and office space located on the approximate 10 acre site.\n       The risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the ammonia storage and delivery system was able to escape into the atmosphere.   In the worst-case scenario the toxic end point is located "

      "SummaryText": "off the property within the community, the alternate release scenario was selected as the most likely event that could have a toxic endpoint located off of the subject property.   Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Review were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n       The worst case release scenario considered was as required, specifically being the release of 100% of the ammonia contained within the largest vessel over a 10 minute period.   The analytical results of this scenario show a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately .87 miles, which includes industrial / commercial development, agricultural land and residential areas.   The alternative release scenario chosen as the most likely event involves the release of 300 lbs. of ammonia over a 30 minute period from a leaking valve or cracked pipe.   The distance to the toxic endpoint would be approximately .1 miles in this case.   Both scenarios could result in off-site impacts."
