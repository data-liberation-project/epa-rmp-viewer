The elements of this RMP, dealing with the safe handling and management of chemicals, have been in place and in practice at the plant for many years.  Policies and procedures regarding the prevention of accidental releases, as well as those describing how we respond to accidental releases and other types of potential emergencies, are well established at the plant.  These are described in detail in the Plant Emergency Response Plan and are also summarized in Section 9 of this RMP data element submission as well as Sections 4.1.5 and 4.1.6 of the on-site full-text RMP.  The chemical substance handled at the plant addressed in this RMP (i.e. \"regulated substance\") is chlorine.  The area of the plant where this chemical is handled in the largest quantities (i.e. \"covered process\" as defined in 40 CFR 68.3) is: one (1) to two (2) ninety (90) ton chlorine railcars located at the chlorine unloading area in the center of the plant.\n\nA comprehensive program described in a number of manuals and procedures designed to prevent accidental releases of any chemicals used at the plant has been in place for many years and includes:\n*  Process safety information located throughout the plant;\n*  Process hazard reviews conducted on all manufacturing processes;\n*  Detailed written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safe operation of each process;\n*  Regular employee training on process operating procedures, safety, emergency operation/shutdown & chemical hazard communication;\n*  Maintenance of mechanical integrity of process equipment through regular inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance;\n*  Management of changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures to insure continued safe operation;\n*  Pre-start up safety rev"

      "SummaryText": "iews for new or modified processes;\n*  Periodic compliance reviews to evaluate whether procedures and practices to prevent accidental releases are adequate and are being followed;\n*  Routine investigation of any incidents which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a release of chemicals;\n*  Employee participation in process hazards analyses, development of process safety procedures, and full access to all information required under RMP.\n\nOver the past five (5) years, the plant has had one accidental release from the process covered in this RMP that injured one employee who received treatment.  There were no other accidental releases from processes covered in this RMP that resulted in deaths, injuries requiring treatment (other than first aid) administered by a physician or registered healthcare professional under orders from a physician, or significant property damage on or off the plant site.  In the event of an accidental release, the plant would activate its Emergency Response Plan.  This plan specifies actions to be taken in response to any release.  The plan includes procedures for making notifications to parties outside the plant and is fully coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) plan.\n\nThe plant continuously strives to improve the safety of its operations through its central safety committee which meets on a regular basis."
