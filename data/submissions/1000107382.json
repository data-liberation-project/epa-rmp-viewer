      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBear Creek Winery facility conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response.\n\nOn-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide initial response. Initial response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Bear Creek Winery facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan. The ammonia system is used for wine chilling and glycol chilling operations. There are three separate refrigeration systems at the facility: \n\n 1.\tSystem-1 (RC1/SC1): This refrigeration system consists of reciprocating compressor & oil separator, screw compressor & oil separator, evaporative condenser, high-pressure receiver, low-pressure receiver w/ ammonia pumps & oil pot, plate frame and shell & tube heat exchangers, multiple jacketed wine tanks and a diffusion tank.

The total ammonia charge of this system is approximately 5,000 lb.\n\n3.\tSystem-3 (RC3/SC3): This refrigeration system consists of reciprocating compressor & oil separator, screw compressor & oil separator, evaporative condenser, high-pressure receiver, suction accumulator, low-pressure receiver w/ ammonia pumps & oil pot, shell & tube heat exchangers w/ oil pot. The safety relief valves\u0092 discharge header is tied to the system RC1/SC1 diffusion tank. This is the largest single refrigeration system and has a total ammonia charge of approximately 16,000 lb.\n\n4.\tIn addition to these three single refrigeration systems, the facility leases a portable refrigeration trailer from Western Precooling Systems (WPS) during crush season for a duration of approximately eight (8) weeks. This portable refrigeration trailer operates as connected to the System 1 and no additional ammonia is added to the system. The trailer is brought to the System 1 area, across the shell & tube heat exchanger, and consists of one screw compressor, one evaporative condenser and one high-pressure receiver.\n\nThe total ammonia charge in all the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 28,500 lbs.\n\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 (Refrigeration System Drawings) of the RMP Binder. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder.

      "SummaryText": "mpression cycles. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration systems is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder. \nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBear Creek Winery facility maintains a release prevention program to prevent or mitigate releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix 16 - Incident Investigation of the RMP Binder.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators, contractors and mechanics are trained in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency reporting and monitoring and assisting local emergency responders in the event of an ammonia release. There are relief valves protecting pressure vessels which relieve to diffusion tanks. System 1 has an emergency control box with a water/ammonia mixing chamber to manually redirect pressure. System 2 and System 3 have emergency pressure control system (automatic crossover valves) installed.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Bear Creek Winery personnel, there has been no accident in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuati"

Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \n\nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
