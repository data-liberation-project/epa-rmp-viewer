This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility manufactures a variety of aerosol products.  Barbasol has 2 regulated substances above the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity at the facility, Isobutane and Propane, both flammable gases.  A mixture of 84.8% Isobutane and 15.2% Propane, called A-46, is received at the facility in typical 31,000 USG size railcars and transferred to an 18,000 USG size storage tank.  The A-46 mixture of Isobutane and Propane is used as an aerosol propellant in Barbasol products.\r\n\r\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nBarbasol has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standards, 2004 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\r\n\r\nBarbasol maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\r\n\r\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to conduct these analyses is What If/Checklist Combined and HAZOP.
