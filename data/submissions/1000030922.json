Our primary focus has traditionally been on the sale, delivery and safe handling of bulk chemicals. Today, the Company is becoming more specialized by working with customers with very exacting specifications seeking appropriate and innovative alternatives to meet their respective needs.\r\n\r\nThe Water Treatment Group provides water and waste-water treatment equipment and chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.\r\n\r\nHawkins also serves customers on a relatively regional basis in the Industrial sector in the fields of energy, electronics, chemical processing, pulp and paper, medical devices and plating.  Food manufacturers and processing plants as well as pharmaceutical concerns across the nation benefit from Hawkins' chemical distribution, blending and related expertise. \r\n\r\nHawkins' mission is to exceed our customers' expectations as a high-quality, service-oriented chemical supplier. We adapt quickly to the changing chemical needs of customers with a keen focus on technical expertise, teamwork, safety, profitability, and responsible care of the environment and of our community.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nHawkins' management has set a goal of 'zero accidents' which includes both injuries and environmental releases.  Support for this goal is manifested in a number of ways such as:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA corporate Health, Safety and Environmental department staffed with trained professionals.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining programs in chemical safety, accident prevention and emergency response.\r\n\u00bf\tPrompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent\r\n          future occurrences.\r\n\u00bf\tAdherence to all OSHA regulations governing our operations.\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance with DOT requi"

Hawkins supplies bleach used in disinfection at food processors and health facilities.  Among our chemicals is chlorine which is regulated by RMP.  Billings also stores sulfur dioxide, but our inventory is below the RMP regulatory threshold.\r\n\r\nAccident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect cylinders during shipping, storage and use.  This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing, as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and they are provided with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.\r\n\r\nWe also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the environment.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our diligence, there has not been an accident involving chlorine at this facility within the last five years, nor has there ever been any such accident since the start-up of operations here.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a minor leak, employees are trained how to detect the source and take appropriate action such as tightening a valve.  If a larger accident should occur, Hawkins employees are trained to call in the local fire department that is familiar with our operations.  We have on site a special recovery vessel into which a leaking container can be inserted to contain further release from a cylinder.\r\n\r\nWhile Hawkins desires to continu"
