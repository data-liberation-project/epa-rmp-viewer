Crestwood (Crestwood Service LLC) management goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Tirzah Storage Terminal is owned and operated by Crestwood Service LLC where propane is received via pipeline and stored in pressure tanks or one underground storage cavern.  Propane is loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only.  Propane and Ethly mercaptan are the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Tirzah Storage Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Crestwood.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\nB\u00b7 Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\nC\u00b7 Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Plains purchased the terminal.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents at Tirzah Terminal in the previous 5 years that meet the RMP reporting requirements.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which is coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the York Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the York County Sheriff's Office, South Carlonia State Police, County Emergency Services and the South Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.  The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\nB\u00b7 The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continu"
