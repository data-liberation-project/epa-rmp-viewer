The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security. Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\n\nPerdue Milford has complied with Delaware's Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act (EHSRMA) since its promulgation in 1989 and the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 of 1992. Up-to-date process information, such as equipment information, piping and instrument diagrams and Material Safety Data Sheets, are kept onsite. Employee participation includes operation and maintenance procedures development, review and training. Contractors are required to submit qualification statements of competency. Process hazard analyses with recommendations have been done and corrective actions taken. Annual mechanical integrity inspections are scheduled. In addition, Perdue performs internal audits on its PSM substances.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no on-site accidents involving ammonia at the Perdue Milford facility that have resulted in death, injuries, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPerdue Milford has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations. The facility has a trained HAZWOPER (HAZardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release or other emergency situation"

Evacuation exercises are conducted, and drills are scheduled with the local emergency responders, Carlisle Fire Company.\nPerdue Milford is a member of the Kent County Local Emergency Planning Committee and is part of the community emergency response plan. Perdue's Milford's Environmental and Safety Manager participated in a Haz Mat training seminar sponsored by Delaware Emergency Management Agency on April 4, 2009. Also the Environmental Manager and Refrigeration Manager attended an 8 hour Ammonia Safety Day training on June 18, 2008. The State of Delaware and DEMA (Delaware Emergency Management Agency) have instituted the First Alert Telephone Notification System that allows for a reverse 911 procedure for notification of communities in the event of a chemical release or other emergency. The system can be activated by the Fire Company Incident Commander, Manager of Kent LEPC or the SERT (State Emergency Response Team).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are two RETA (Refrigeration Engineering Technician Association) Level A Certified operators at the facility. Perdue continues its five-year PRV replacement program. In April 2009 a new rechiller was installed. We have replaced new oil pots on all four recirculators and have improved the relief valve discharge pipes. A new ammonia detection system was installed that expanded the protection area. In 2008, a new HAZWOPER trailer was bought and supplied with new equipment. There was a new condenser bought and installed during the 2008 year. Also during 2008 a new condenser coil was installed. A cell phone was issued to improve on-site communications with operator to management.\nAs part of Perdue Farms continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Milford facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety"
