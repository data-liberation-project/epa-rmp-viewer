Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Oxarc, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing, repackaging, storage, and sales of gases.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Ammonia (anhydrous), Acetylene  [Ethyne], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Chlorine.  All of these substances are for resale and are not used within our facility.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 36420.00 lb. while Acetylene  [Ethyne], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Chlorine are present at our facility in quantities of 19225.00 lb., 17000.00 lb. and 11250.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Sulfur Dioxide bulk storange tank.  In this scenario 17000 lb. of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation tak"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 12 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from  a 150 pound chlorine cylinder.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by an \"A\"  style containment kit which can limitl  the quantity released.  Under neutral weather conditions the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.31miles.                          \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a  release from a 150 lb. Sulfur Dioxide  cylinder.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lbs. offSulfur Dioxide .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.31 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Ammonia bulk storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

In this scenario 19225 lb. of Acetylene  [Ethyne] is released.  The release quantity has been calculated as the maximum quantity on hand.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.22 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Acetylene manufacturing.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 2310 lb. of Acetylene  [Ethyne] in  minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as deluge system(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measure that is a water de luge system.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.07 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken  steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOxarc, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified"
