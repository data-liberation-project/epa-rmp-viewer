(Sorrento) proactively uses the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119, in conjunction with the additional off-site considerations addressed in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental ammonia release prevention program.  These documents are considered by working documents by Sorrento Management, and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n          Emergency response policies for the Sorrento facility include an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) Emergency Action Plan, 40 CFR Part 355 Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know, 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management, and 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Program.  The integration of these programs for the Sorrento Facility increases the usefulness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  In general, Sorrento's performs minor emergency response measures with properly trained in-house personnel, however, local emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies.  Community notification policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.\n\n          The regulated stationary source is considered to be the entire Sorrento Cheese Company, Inc. facility located at 2375 South Park Avenue in Buffalo, New York.  The stationary source is involved in the manufacture of various cheese products.  Ammonia liquified under pressure is the only regulated chemical exceeding a threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n          The worst-case scenario release involves a complete system release from the high pressure receiver of the Main Plant refrigeration system.  This includes a release of 32,500 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period.  The endpoint distance of 2.1 miles was calculated using Exhibit 4-4 in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prev"

      "SummaryText": "ention Office's document Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n          The alternative release scenario involves the venting of one of several relief valves from the facility's ammonia refrigeration system.  The orifice of the relief valve is 0.5 inches in diameter and the release occurs at a pressure of 180 PSI.  Referring to Exhibit 4-6 in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68), an endpoint distance of 0.2 miles results.\n\n          The accidental release prevention program integrates the OSHA Process Safety Management required under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the additional off-site considerations addressed in the 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental release release prevention program.  One of the most important aspects of the prevention program is strict adherence to the mechanical integrity portion of the PSM program, using specific standards established for the ammonia refrigeration industry by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).\n\n          There have been no reportable accidents at the Sorrento facility over the past five years.\n\n          The emergency response program follows the facility's emergency response policy which consists of an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) Emergency Action Plans, 40 CFR Part 355 Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know, 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management, and 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Program.  An integral aspect of the emergency response program is the continual corporate emphasis placed on proper employee training.\n\n          Planned changes to improve overall safety at Sorrento include installation of a highly visible wind-sock to aid personnel in an emergency situation, relocation of several refrgeration system relief valves, and installation of additional refrigeration system monitoring devices.  Improvement in safety will also be encouraged by continual involvemen"
