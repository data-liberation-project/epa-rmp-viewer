      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nReliant Energy Northeast Management Company operates a coal-fired, electric power generating station near New Florence, Pennsylvania.  This 1,750-acre facility is located 13 miles northwest of Johnstown, PA, between the Conemaugh River and Power Plant Road. The facility is known as the Conemaugh Generating Station.\n\nConemaugh Generating Station employs approximately 198 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees during times of facility maintenance.  The secondary impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  For example, the station provides employment for numerous coal miners and trucking firms.\n\nThe station is a major component of the billion-dollar power development in the Chestnut Ridge area.  Conemaugh was constructed by investor-owned utilities representing a number of eastern states.  Reliant Energy Northeast Management Company is responsible for operations at the site as an agent for the investor-owned utilities.\n\nThe facility generates 1700 MW of power from two identical, 850 MW units.  Each unit maintains a pollution control system: electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) for particulate, wet limestone scrubbers for sulfur dioxides, and special burners to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.\n\n\n1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nReliant Energy Northeast Management Company?s policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n2.    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\na.    PRIMARY ACTIVITIES ? The facility is a coal-fired, electric power generating station.\n\nb.    USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES ? Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Conemaugh Station as a fluegas conditioner.  The ammonia improves the ability of the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to remove particulate from the flue gas.  In this process, the ammonia is converted to ammonium sulf"

QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED ? The anhydrous ammonia is transported, stored and conveyed as a liquid up to evaporators.  A single 12,000-gallon storage tank for the anhydrous ammonia is located outdoors, adjacent to the Unit No. 2 ESP is used to store the anhydrous ammonia liquid.   The storage tank is kept under pressure to maintain ammonia in the liquid form. Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% capacity level.\n\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nIn order to minimize the potential for the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at the facility a number of release prevention program initiatives and prevention steps have been instituted, including:\n\n-    A comprehensive OSHA Process Safety Management Program.\n-    The registration, installation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel in accordance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.\n-    The development of off-loading procedures for the receipt of anhydrous ammonia. These procedures require: each shipment to be physically monitored by an employee fully trained in process safety; the utilization of an off-loading checklist prior to and during each shipment received; and the requirement that all shipments of ammonia are received during weekdays, and daylight hours.\n-    The use of administrative controls to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% capacity level.\n-    The routine inspection and testing of the ammonia system and components to ensure system integrity and performance.\n-    A comprehensive training program for all plant personnel with regards to Process Safety Management and the hazards associated with the use, storage, and release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has not experienced "

      "SummaryText": "any accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 during the last five-years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan that has been in place for many years.  A portion of this emergency responses plan is specifically dedicated to a release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility routinely conducts release related drills and the review of scenarios to ensure proper response activities in the unlikely event of release from the ammonia system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the facility?s safety programs and related initiatives, including the facility emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities."
