All products are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\n\n\nEnergy Transfer has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  The policy includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping systems as well as new equipment purchases.  The facility operations personnel also issue hot work permits and safe work permits for maintenance activities within the operation units.\n\n\n\nSafety Inspections at the Facility\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts the following safety inspections on the basis as noted:\n\nWork areas - as needed\n\nPortable fire extinguishers - monthly\n\nPressure vessels - as specified in API\n\nExtension cords, motorized hand tools - every three months\n\nYards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years.  In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.  \n\n\n\nThe facility also has a"
