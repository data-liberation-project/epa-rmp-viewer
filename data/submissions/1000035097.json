Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe W R Grace-CONN Curtis Bay, Maryland Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is company and site  policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the site has HazWoper trained individuals on site to control and mitigate the effects of incipient releases.  They do not have the ability to respond to emergencies requiring Class A or B PPE. The site is also part of SBIMAP and coordinates with the Baltimore City FD Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility's primary activities encompass (insert description).
