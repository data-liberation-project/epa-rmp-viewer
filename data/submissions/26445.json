The covered processes consist of piping, as per Chlorine Institute pamphlet 6, Piping Systems for Dry Chlorine, and chlorine injection equipment specifically designed for the process.\n\n\nPart 68.155 Section C\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nDecatur Utilities has used release scenarios for both worst case and alternative releases from, The Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, sponsored jointly by The American Water Works Association Research Foundation and The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development, and published by AWWA in 1998*. Additionally, the rate of release and endpoints corresponding to the above scenarios were derived from EPA CEPP, RMP Series, Risk Management for Wastewater Treatment Plants.** \n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a direct release over a 10 minute period, as required by the regulations. It involves catastrophic failure of a one ton container due to impact, corrosion, or construction defect. The entire contents of a full container, 2,000 pounds, is released over a ten minute period at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.* The toxic endpoint was modeled as 1.3 mile radius in all directions from the point of release.** The affected population was estimated at 910.***\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes release of chlorine gas through 20 feet of 1 inch schedule 80 pipe due to complete failure of the pipe. The scenario assumes that the pressure in the pipe is approximately 97.5 pounds per square inch, which is the vapor pressure of chlorine at 77 degrees F. It also assumes that the release is limited by the pipe dimensions and not by any valve or opening upstream of the release. The release durition is 60 minutes at an average release rate of 72 lb/min. The total release is 4,320 pounds with a toxic endpoint of 0.8 miles. The population is estimated at 560.\n\n\nPart 155.68 SectionD\n\nPrevention "

The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to various RMP management groups.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered process and maintenance employees in accordance with CRF 40 Part 68.48. Safety information includes current MSDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedures and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA hazard analysis has been performed for  the program II covered processes. A checklist was used based on The Chlorine Institute's, The Chlorine manual, pamphlet 1 6th edition, January 1997. Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safegaurds in place to prevent a release. The process hazard analysis was documented  and will be updated every five years.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees. Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown. Process limits were reviewed and documented. Emergency first aid care for chlorine exposures are outlined and included in training.\n\n\nTraining\n\nChlorine safety training and Red Cross first aid and CPR training is mandatory for all plant employees and is conducted annually. Other mandatory training is conducted  every 3 years for all plant operators and maintenance employees and includes emergency"

Training for all maintenance employees is conducted every 3 years and covers process and chlorinator maintenance and repair, chlorine piping specifications, and management of change procedures. Documentation of employee attendance at all training sessions are maintained for a period of not less than 5 years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAll process equipment, piping, ventilation system, monorail and hoist have a documented schedule of inspection and preventive and periodic maintenance. All maintenance inspection and testing on chlorine process equipment is conducted as per manufacturer's recommendations and is consistent with accepted engineering practices. Any deficiencies identified during such maintenance and inspection are addressed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\nPart 68.58\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years in accordance with this part. The audit is conducted by a team of at least 3 persons, one of whom is knowledgeable in the process. A report of the audit findings is generated following the audit and all deficiencies or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented. The two most recent audits are maintained at the facility.\n\n\nPart 68.60\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSpecific incident investigation reporting and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with this part in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine gas. The incident investigation is conducted as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours following the incident. Following the investigation a summary report is generated and includes, at a minimum, the following information: date of incident, date the investigation began, description of the incident and any con"

Decatur Utilities has had no accidental release within the past five years.\n\n\nPart 68.155 Section F\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDecatur Utilities has in place an emergency response plan that is coordinated with both state and local emergengy response plans, (LEPC). Additionally, a specific plan has been developed for chlorine emergencies that follows OSHA standard 1910.38. The plan is reviewed and training is conducted with all plant operators add maintenance employees every 3 years. The plan includes comprehensive procedures fo onsite emergencies and is designed to cooridinate with the state and local emergency response plan.\n\n\nPart 68.155 Section G\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes needed at this time."
