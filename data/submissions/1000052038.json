The Facility is located in an urban setting with a mixture of light commercial and industrial uses in the immediate area. The PSM/RMP Program was developed in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention, Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68), authorized under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Facility uses anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance listed in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119 and in 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of the Preferred Freezer Services facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products. Anhydrous ammonia is contained within a closed-loop refrigeration system consisting of vessels, compressors, evaporative condensers, evaporators and associated piping and valves. The refrigeration system cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order provide refrigeration for dock operations and cooler/freezer storage. Typical operating conditions range from 3.6 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side of the system. The maximum intended refrigerant charge within the closed-loop system is approximately 13,367 pounds. The Facility does not use any other chemicals or flammable materials in excess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements. \n\n\n\nEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule requires that facilities that have covered processes establish RMPs to reduce the risks of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials, and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident.

The person who has the overall responsibility for RMP and PSM program implementation at the Facility is the General Manager. \n\n\n\nThe Facility has adopted consensus guidelines published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) as recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. \n\n\n\nAmmonia safety considerations have been incorporated into the installation and operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Compressors are provided with micro-controllers, and a refrigeration control system monitors system operation. Pressure vessels are appropriately rated for pressure and temperature, and are provided with dual pressure relief valves that discharge into an engineered relief vent discharge header. Piping systems and vessels are appropriately insulated to prevent corrosion, and inspections are conducted on refrigeration system components under the Facility's Mechanical Integrity program. The Facility utilizes ammonia sensors within the Compressor Room and throughout the cold storage areas (freezers and dock); gas detection alarms are programmed to shut down affected subsystems of the refrigeration system.

The PHA study was performed according to guidelines for hazard evaluation procedures established by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS). The PHA was performed by a team of subject matter experts in refrigeration system engineering, operations and maintenance, and environmental, health, and safety. For deviations resulting in a safety or environmental consequences, the PHA team determined the relative risk of the deviation based on the Likelihood and Severity of the occurrence using a risk ranking methodology. When the protective devices (hardware, software, procedures, etc.) did not, by the consensus of the PHA team, adequately mitigate potential adverse consequences, the team assigned recommended action items (recommendations) intended to improve the controls and safeguards to further mitigate risk. These corrective actions were recorded and tracked to resolution. \n\n\n\nRefrigeration equipment is maintained in accordance with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications, applicable codes, and industry standards. Preferred Freezer Services has implemented a Mechanical Integrity Program for the ammonia refrigeration system in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(j) and 40 CFR 68.73. The purpose is to verify that critical process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of release of anhydrous ammonia. Facility personnel perform daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections of ammonia refrigeration equipment, and a system integrity check is conducted every 5 years by a qualified third-party.

The demonstration and on-the-job training that they receive cover the physical properties of ammonia and detailed instruction on operating the ammonia refrigeration system, including understanding responding to upset conditions on the ammonia refrigeration system. The Facility has also implemented a formal Contractor Safety Program to address work on or around the refrigeration system by contractor personnel.\n\n\n\nMonthly PSM/RMP topics are provided by Preferred Freezer Services' corporate office for review by the General Manager with personnel under the Facility's Employee Participation Program. These monthly topics are intended to improve safety and performance through refreshing knowledge on specific PSM/RMP program elements, through sharing published information from recent industry-related Chemical Safety Board investigations, or sharing published information about recent OSHA/EPA enforcement activities related to PSM/RMP compliance.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has established a Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan (RERP). Refrigeration operators are trained in the RERP and it is reviewed annually to verify that it is current with Facility operating practice. The plan contains protocols and emergency response procedures to initiate an emergency shutdown of the refrigeration system, and for emergency notifications.  A list of the agencies that must be notified upon a reportable quantity release are included in the RERP to assure the facility meets its reporting obligations and that the public is properly notified in the event of an emergency.
