Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Goforth is a newly constructed facility; therefore, it has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor. Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the facility and local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, Goforth Processing Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\nAt the initial stages of operation, Goforth will employ four (4) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\nThe following information summarizes the Goforth 2006 RMP submission.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nGoforth maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \n\nGoforth has procedures in place, including both on-site activiti"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at Goforth at any given time is 5,528 gallons (22,874 lbs). Goforth also utilizes propane, a regulated flammable substance, as part of the process. The propane is handled in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. The maximum inventory of propane at Goforth is at any given time 5,842 gallons (24,572 lbs).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGoforth has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.180. Goforth maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\nGoforth is a newly constructed facility. For this reason, no accidental releases of NGL or propane occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to March 2006.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is documented in the facility?s Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures, which describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regu"
