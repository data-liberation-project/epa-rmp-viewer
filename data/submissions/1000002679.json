One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Petrolia, PA facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Petrolia, PA facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (AA? 68.155(b))\n\nThe INDSPEC Chemical Corporation Petrolia, PA facility handles 3 substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are as follows:\n\nOLEUM, ETHYL ETHER, FORMALDEHYDE\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (AA? 68.155(d))\n\nThe Petrolia, PA  facilityAA?s prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information,Process Hazard Analysis,Operating Procedures,\nTraining,Mechanical Integrity,Management of Change,\nPre-Startup Review,Compliance Audits,Incident Investigation,\nEmployee Participation,Key Procedures,Contractor Safety Program\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manuals at the facility.

The information which is included regarding the release which occurred on October 11, 2008 is based upon INDSPEC's Investigation to date and includes information on claims which have been submitted to INDSPEC.  In regard to such claims, INDSPEC has not currently undergone a complete investigation to determine the claims validity.\n\nEmergency Response Program (AA? 68.155(f))\n\nThe Petrolia, PA facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (AA?ERTAA?) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (AA?ECCAA?).  In addition, the Petrolia, PA facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (AA?SSPAA?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility supports the efforts of the Butler County Local Emergency Planning Committee (AA?LEPCAA?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (AA? 68.155(g))\n\nThe Petrolia, PA facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the"
