Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, M&L Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1 M&L Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that M&L Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name         | Process Chemical     | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration  Anhydrous Ammonia      54,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n- Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n-"

The facility has one ammonia system which provides refrigerating capacity to six precool rooms equipped with forced air cooling and ten cold storage rooms for palleted product.\n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe facility was built by B&W Refrigeration in accordance with standard design and installation practices of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems. In 2010, California Controlled Atmosphere replaced the bunker coils in the shipping room and installed a ventilation system in the engine room.  The system was built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed "

In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the system as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nM&L Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the M&L Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contrac"

Nevertheless, M&L Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved M&L Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that M&L Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nM&L Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed "

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for M&L Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program M&L Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
