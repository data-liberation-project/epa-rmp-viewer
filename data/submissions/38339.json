      "SummaryText": "This risk management plan (RMP) is for Progress Energy Florida, Inc.'s Hines Energy Complex.  The Hines facility is an electric generating plant that contains four combined-cycle natural gas/oil-fired combustion turbines.  The process affected by Section 112r requirements is storage of aqueous ammonia in two separate storage systems. The two tanks are used for selective catalytic reduction of Nox emissions. One tank serves combustion turbines 1A and 1B, the second tank serves combustion turbines 2A and 2B.   The ammonia concentration in water is 30%, and it is stored in two 210,101 pound tanks.  The tanks are surrounded by a dike that is 55 feet by 22 feet by 4 feet high.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored on-site is 420,202 pounds.  Since the ammonia concentration is less than 40%, this process is not subject to OSHA PSM standards.\n\nThe major hazard associated with the storage of aqueous ammonia is the unlikely event of a storage tank failure.  Using EPA's OCA guidance, a tank failure was modeled.  Under this worst-case scenario, the contents of the storage tank leave the tank into the diked area surrounding it.   There are no public or environmental receptors located within the toxic end point of the ammonia storage tank.\n\nReleases are prevented through the use of well-maintained storage equipment.  There have been no releases of aqueous ammonia at the site during the last five years.  The first tank was installed in September 1998.  Ammonia storage quantities have been reported to, and emergency response procedures coordinated with, the District 7 LEPC, which is the Polk County Emergency Operations office."
