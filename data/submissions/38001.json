The Plant and Frontier Field Services, LLC  have  a\n\nsafety  record that is among the very best in the energy industry\n\nin  the  United  States.  To help ensure the safety  of  Frontier\n\nField  Services, LLC operations, the company invests  significant\n\nresources  in accident prevention.  Accident prevention  includes\n\ndesigning  safe  plants and operating facilities, conducting  and\n\nproviding  safety  training for employees  and  contractors,  and\n\ndeveloping  and  implementing safe work practices and  procedures\n\nfor  the  operation  and  maintenance of plants,  processes,  and\n\noperations  facilities.  Frontier's policies  and  dedication  to\n\nsafety  and  environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental\n\nreleases.\n\n\n\nIf,  despite  our  best  attempts to prevent  such  incidents,  a\n\nrelease should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control,\n\nand  contain the release in accordance with the plant's  Incident\n\nResponse Plan.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's  new\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which\n\nwere promulgated in the Federal Register on\n\nThursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe  Maljamar  Gas Plant, located in Lea County, New  Mexico,  is\n\nowned  and operated by Frontier Field Services, LLC. The Maljamar\n\nGas  Plant  is  a  cryogenic natural gas processing  plant  which\n\nextracts hydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.  Three\n\nraw   natural  gas  streams  (Low-Pressure  System,  Intermediate\n\npressure  System,  and High-pressure System)  are  delivered  via\n\npipeline  to  the  plant.  After extraction  of  the  hydrocarbon\n\nliquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as product.   The\n\nsite consists of inlet gas sepa"

[Note:  The  term\n\n\"threshold  quantity\" is the quantity above  which  the  EPA  has\n\ndecided  that  the substance will be regulated.]  Our  evaluation\n\ndetermined  that  the following listed flammable  substances  are\n\nhandled   by  the  plant  in  quantities  above  the  substance's\n\nthreshold quantity: ethane/propane/butane/condensate (EPBC)  mix,\n\ncondensate,  and  propane.   [Note:  condensate  is  exempt  from\n\nthreshold  determination  based on its National  fire  Protection\n\nAssociation  (NFPA) rating of 3.]  There are no toxic  substances\n\nabove  the  threshold quantity at the plant.  Based on worst-case\n\nanalyses  of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints\n\n(i.e.  an  overpressure of 1 psi) include  one  offsite  receptor\n\n(ConocoPhillips Production Office). In addition, the Maljamar Gas\n\nPlant  has  not had an accidental release in the past five  years\n\nand  emergency  response procedures have  been  coordinated  with\n\ncommunity  response organizations. Therefore,  the  Maljamar  Gas\n\nPlant  is  classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental\n\nRelease Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe  Maljamar Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances  above\n\nthreshold  quantity.

For flammables, this hypothetical  worst\n\ncase   assumes  an  instantaneous  release  and  a  vapor   cloud\n\nexplosion.  These  assumptions are  required  without  regard  to\n\nwhether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  EPBC mix was used\n\nin  the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.\n\nThe  worst-case  scenario was modeled on the  assumption  of  the\n\ninstantaneous release of all of the EPBC mix in the largest  EPBC\n\nmix  vessel.   Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical\n\nrelease, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined\n\nby the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\n\n\nPassive  mitigation  systems  were not  applied  because  of  the\n\nassumption  for  the  scenario that the entire  contents  of  the\n\nvessel  be  instantaneously released.  We believe that  a  vessel\n\nfailure  such as this is extremely unlikely because  the  vessels\n\nare   carefully  designed  with  significant  engineering  safety\n\nfactors.\n\n\n\nIn  addition,  all pressure vessels are carefully  inspected  and\n\npressure  tested  before  they are placed  in  service,  and  the\n\nMaljamar  Gas  Plant  follows  a  rigorous  Mechanical  Integrity\n\nProgram   to  ensure  that  all  process  equipment  is  properly\n\nmaintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBased  on  the  criteria in 40 CFR 68.10,  the  distance  to  the\n\nspecified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario\n\nfor  the following processes is greater than the distance to  the\n\nnearest   public  receptor  (ConocoPhillips  Production  Office):\n\npropane  and EPBC mix.
