To help ensure the safety  of  Frontier\r\nField  Services, LLC operations, the company invests  significant\r\nresources  in accident prevention.  Accident prevention  includes\r\ndesigning  safe  plants and operating facilities, conducting  and\r\nproviding  safety  training for employees  and  contractors,  and\r\ndeveloping  and  implementing safe work practices and  procedures\r\nfor  the  operation  and  maintenance of plants,  processes,  and\r\noperations  facilities.

Three\r\nraw   natural  gas  streams  (Low-Pressure  System,  Intermediate\r\npressure  System,  and High-pressure System)  are  delivered  via\r\npipeline  to  the  plant.  After extraction  of  the  hydrocarbon\r\nliquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as product.   The\r\nsite consists of inlet gas sepa"

Products  are\r\ntransported from the facility via pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn  accordance  with  the  EPA's Risk  Management  Program  (RMP)\r\nregulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Maljamar Gas Plant's  inventory\r\nof   chemicals  was  evaluated  to  determine  if  any  regulated\r\nflammable  or  toxic  substances  were  on  the  plant  site   in\r\nquantities  above  the  threshold quantities.   [Note:  The  term\r\nthreshold  quantity is the quantity above  which  the  EPA  has\r\ndecided  that  the substance will be regulated.]  Our  evaluation\r\ndetermined  that  the following listed flammable  substances  are\r\nhandled   by  the  plant  in  quantities  above  the  substance's\r\nthreshold quantity: ethane/propane/butane/condensate (EPBC)  mix,\r\ncondensate,  and  propane.   [Note:  condensate  is  exempt  from\r\nthreshold  determination  based on its National  fire  Protection\r\nAssociation  (NFPA) rating of 3.]  There are no toxic  substances\r\nabove  the  threshold quantity at the plant.  Based on worst-case\r\nanalyses  of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints\r\n(i.e.  an  overpressure of 1 psi) include  one  offsite  receptor\r\n(ConocoPhillips Production Office). In addition, the Maljamar Gas\r\nPlant  has  not had an accidental release in the past five  years\r\nand  emergency  response procedures have  been  coordinated  with\r\ncommunity  response organizations. Therefore,  the  Maljamar  Gas\r\nPlant  is  classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental\r\nRelease Prevention (ARP) Program.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe  Maljamar Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances  above\r\nthreshold  quantity.

For flammables, this hypothetical  worst\r\ncase   assumes  an  instantaneous  release  and  a  vapor   cloud\r\nexplosion.  These  assumptions are  required  without  regard  to\r\nwhether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  EPBC mix was used\r\nin  the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.\r\nThe  worst-case  scenario was modeled on the  assumption  of  the\r\ninstantaneous release of all of the EPBC mix in the largest  EPBC\r\nmix  vessel.   Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical\r\nrelease, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined\r\nby the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\r\n\r\nPassive  mitigation  systems  were not  applied  because  of  the\r\nassumption  for  the  scenario that the entire  contents  of  the\r\nvessel  be  instantaneously released.
