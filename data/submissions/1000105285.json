Alliance management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors and through open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Leicester Siding Facility is owned by Green Mountain Railroad and leased by Alliance. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until procurement can find a suitable market for the liquids. Odorized propane is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is present at the Leicester Siding Facility in amounts above threshold quantity. Because the facility is unmanned and remote, it is not required to comply with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Therefore, the facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the RMP regulation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Alliance. These high standards include:\n\n\u0095 Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations\n\u0095 Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized\n\u0095 Operating and ma"
