Additional fertilizer branch operations are at Pine City and Diamond Spear.  The primary activity of these facilities is the storage and delivery of fertilizers to farmers to enhance crop production.  Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia are stored and distributed for crop production to farmers in the surrounding geographical area.  (2) Facility Accidental Release Policy:  The management and employees of St. John Grange Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other emergency response entities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan is being developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  (3) Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhyrous Ammonia\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (4) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Effective February 2005 St. John Grange Supply hired Safety and Health Coordination a consulting entity as a measure to improve the overall safety culture and enhance employee safety training programs.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions at the facility."
