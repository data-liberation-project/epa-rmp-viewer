      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n \r\n1.1\tIntroduction\r\n\r\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r). These rules require facilities that contain threshold quantities of materials on a list of toxic and flammable chemicals to create and update a Risk Management Plan for the facility. Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents. In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate worst case and alternative case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical. Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.   \r\n\r\nThis report is the required update of the Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility submitted in 2009.  After the 2009 submission, the Rohm and Haas Company has merged with the Dow Chemical Company and the use of vinyly acetate at the Plant has been discontinued.  While the Rohm and Haas name is still supported within Dow as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, the Hayward plant will be referenced to in this updated RMP plan as The Dow Chemical Company Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility.\r\n\r\nThis document comprises the RMP plan for The Dow Chemical Company Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility.  The plan contains a description of the procedures and provisions used to reduce the likelihood and severity of an RMP regulated substance release or accident. The RMP plan is based upon a complete assessment of the processes, operations, and procedures of the plant and an analysis of potential releases of RMP regulated substances that may occur at the plant and their impacts on the offsite populations.\r\n\r\n1.2\tGeneral Description of the Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe Dow Chemical Rohm and Haas facility is located in the city of Hayward, California at 25500 Whitesell"

      "SummaryText": "Street near the intersection of State Highway 92 and Clawitter. The plant is constructed on a parcel of approximately 33 acres at the corner of Whitesell Street and Breakwater Avenue. The northern portion of the property consists of the raw material and finished product storage areas, the plant Process Building, a warehouse, plant utilities, and the plant office and laboratory. The southern portion of the property is undeveloped, with the exception of approximately 3 acres that are leased to Trimac Transportation Services. Trimac operates a dedicated truck terminal exclusively for Rohm and Haas products. Railroad spurs border the eastern and northern edges of the property and a series of treated wastewater sand filters is located at the northwest corner of the property.\r\n\r\nThe Hayward Facility is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility that produces a variety of non-hazardous water-based polymeric emulsions. This activity is described by SIC code 2821 and NAICS code 325211. Approximately sixty different products are manufactured at the plant using different mixtures of reactants. These products are used by our customers to manufacture water-based paints, floor polishes, adhesives, caulks, and other household and industrial products.\r\n\r\nPolymeric emulsions are produced in two parallel process units and all products are manufactured in batch operations.  The major raw materials used are monomers which are received by railcars, tank truck or deck tank. Each of these major raw materials is stored in a dedicated tank with a dedicated pump that is used to unload the railcar, tank truck or deck tank, and to feed the raw material to the process\r\n\r\nOnce in the Process Building, raw materials are typically pumped to either a mix tank for preliminary mixing with other raw materials and additives, or directly into an emulsion tank where they are mixed with additives.  The emulsion mixture is then sent 2to the reactor where catalyst and activators are added to initiate the p"
