The refinery is situated along the east bank of the Mississippi River at mile marker 168. Convent Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, furnace oil, etc.) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane, as well as flammable mixtures. \n\n\n\nOne of the by-products of petroleum refining is hydrogen sulfide, which is an EPA RMP listed toxic substance.

However, the quantity of these substances in any process is also below the EPA RMP thresholds.\n\n\n\n3.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Convent Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n3.1    Employee Participation\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team or incident investigation team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan, entitled Standing Instruction 5.19 - Employee Participation that is maintained at the refinery. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.2    Process Safety Information\n\n \n\nConvent Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address the hazards of the chemicals in the processes, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used in the processes. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical area classifications, piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs), etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.  \n\n\n\n3.3    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA teams findings are entered into a computer data base and assigned to appropriate depa"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Convent Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\n3.5    Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Convent Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\n\n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training.

All employees who will be involved in operating a process will be expected to successfully complete a training program that consists of a predefined set of learning modules to prepare employees for specific job assignments. This standard also provides for skill maintenance and improvement through refresher training. At Convent, this practice has been enhanced with the establishment the Learning and Development Center.\n\n\n\nMeasurement and Goals collects leading and lagging process safety metrics to establish baselines for the company refineries. This baseline data, coupled with historical performance and external benchmarks, will communicate lessons learned and spot safety-related trends. One of the leading indicators is the number of PHA open recommendations.\n\n\n\nAudits and Assessments establish uniform guidelines and methods for performing audits and assessments required by regulations and by the company.

Type 1 is typically an individual fact based review of the event. Type 2 is a formal, structured fact based analysis completed by a small group and facilitated by a trained coordinator. Type 3 is Root Cause Analysis (RCA) facilitated by a trained coordinator. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) establishes a consistent methodology at all the company refineries. The company standardized on the HAZOP methodology, established a uniform reporting format, a uniform management review and approval process of PHA recommendations, and a uniform performance measurement process.\n\n\n\nAll the initiatives make good business sense and reflect the long-term commitment the company has to the refining business. These initiatives are intended to be permanent and evergreen. Metrics (and consequently accountability) for each initiative have been established and once the initiative has been implemented these metrics are intended to be met or exceeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
