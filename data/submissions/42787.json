The EPA facility ID# is 1000 0016 9293.\n\nThe construction of the Delaware City Power Plant [The Power Plant], formerly Delmarva Delaware City Power Plant, was the result of an agreement between Tidewater Oil Company and Delmarva Power & Light in the mid 1950's.  The majority of the steam and electricity produced was dedicated for use in the Tidewater Delaware City Refinery operations.  The first boiler was placed into service in 1955.  Under terms of the agreement, Delmarva Power financed the construction of the Power Plant and Tidewater contracted Delmarva Power to operate the facility with an option to purchace the facilities at the end of the thirty-year agreement period.  After several extensions of the agreement, Star Enterprise exerc ised their option to purchase the Power Plant facilities in 1992.  Delmarva Power & Light merged w ith Atlantic Electric Company in 1998 to form a holding company known as, Conectiv.  Star Enterprise formed a limited partnership in 1998 with Shell, Texaco and Saudi Aramco under the name Motiva Enterprises, LLC [Motiva].  Motiva contracted Conectiv Operating Services Company [COSC], which was a subsidiary of Conectiv, to operate and maintain the power plant and facilities associated with the Repowering Project, which was scheduled for initial operation in year 2000.  As of January 2003 Conectiv operates the Delawaree City Power Plant through its subsidiary Delaware Operating Services Company [DOSC].  Under the terms of the an Operating and Maintenance Agreement, DOSC assists complying with the regulatory requirements applicable to the power plant operations, including the Delaware Accidental Release Prevention Regulation.  The RMPs currently on file designate Motiva as the owner of the Refinery and the Power Plant.  Premcor Refinery Group Inc. purchased the Refinery and Power Plant from Motiva, effective May 1, 2004.\n\n(a) Acciden"

      "SummaryText": "tal Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Power Plant boilers are designed to fire a mixture of fuels including petroleum coke, refinery fuel / natural gas, and No. 6 fuel oil.  The petroleum coke and the refinery fuel gas are by-products from the Delaware City refinery operations.  Refinery Fuel Gas is a mixture of refinery gases and natural gas transported through an overhead pipeline to the power plant facilities.  The Refinery Fuel Gas is comprised mostly of methane and is not stored on site.  In September 1989, the Refinery Fuel Gas process became regulated on Delaware's former risk management of Extremely Hazard Substance Regulations because the Potential Release Quantity from the Refinery Fuel Gas process at the power plant exceeds the regulatory release rate threshold [sufficient quantity, SQ] for methane.  The power plant registered the RFG process with Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control [DNREC] in December 1993.  On June 21, 1999 COSC submitted a Risk Management Plan to DNREC for a covered process, Refinery Fuel Gas, under a Program 1 status.\n\nThe Repowering Project encompassed the manufacture of synthetic gas from petroleum coke and included the construction of petroleum coke gasifiers, combustion turbines, heat recovery steam generators, an air separation plant and other equipment, as well as modifications to the power plant.  As a result of the construction of the Repowering Project, COSC had identified additional covered processes as defined by the Delaware Accidental Release Prevention Regulaton [DARPR] associated with the Gasificaton Process [manufacture of synthetic gas-syngas].  Consequently, in April / May 2000 COSC revised the Risk Management Plan [RMP] that had been submitted to include the original covered process [Refinery Fuel Gas] and additional covered processes.  The covered processes are defined as stated in section [b].  On June 21, 2004 DOSC re-submitted the Refinery Fuel Gas RMP as covere"

The DC-CAER group members support and work closely with local response organizations, including New Castle County LEPC, to prevent accidental releases and mitigate the consequences of an accidental release by preparing coordinating response plans in the event of an accidental release.  DOSC has a Safety Program that is central to its operations and maintenance activities.  The Facility Manager has overall responsibility for maintaining an effective safey program.  In compliance with DARPR, DOSC is committed to maintaining effective Risk Management Programs for the identified covered processes.\n\n(b) Stationary Sources [Covered Processes] and Regulated Substances\n\nDOSC has identified the following covered processes and has concluded that three are subject to Section 6 of the DAPRP and one is subject to Section 5 of DAPRP.  Section 5 of DAPRP is the incorporation of 40CFR Part 68 Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Provision requirements into DAPRP.  Section 6 is Delaware's extension of 40CFR Part 68 that had previously been the Delaware \"Regulation for the Management of Extremely Hazardous Substances\".\n\nCovered process No. 1 [CP1] is the Refinery Fuel Gas process with regulated substance methane [flammable].

The hydrogen concentration in the syngas is great enough that the entire amount of synthesis gas is considered hydrogen for the purposes of determining the threshold quantity for RMP.  The quantity of H2S in the process is greater than the OSHA PSM standard threshold, 1500 pounds.  Subsequently, the syngas process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard and, consequently, CP4 is classified as a RMP Program 3 process. Therefore, CP4 is subject to Section 5 of DAPRP, requiring a submission of RMP to Federal EPA.\n\nThis RMP submittal is for CP4, Synthetic Gas Manufacturing Process.\n\nCP4 - Syngas Manufacture\n\nThe Syngas Manufacturing Process [CP4] contains the regulated flammable substance, hydrogen.  The weight percent of hydrogen in the syngas varies from 1.02 percent to 2.9 percent within the process.  In accordance with DARPR Section 1.115 (b) (1) and 40 CFR 68.115 (b) (2), if the regulated substance is present in concentrations of one percent or greater by weight, then the entire weight of the mixture shall be treated as a regulated substance [unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture does not have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Rating of 4].  Syngas is associated with a NFP rating of 4.  The total amount of syngas stored within the process has been calcuated at 23,220 pounds, which is greater than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity. Subsequently, CP4 is considered subject to DARPR Section 5, requiring the associated RMP submittal to the Federal EPA.\n\nThe total amount of hydrogen sulfide stored within the CP4 process has been calculated at 2,067 pounds, which is less than the 10,000 - pound threshold quantity.  Therefore, a worst-case release scenario is not required for this regulated substance with respect to Section 5 of DARPR.  The amount of hydrogen sulfide in certain pipelines within the process would exceed the sufficient quantity [SQ] specified in Section 6 of DARPR.  In recognition of this fact, an"

The AGA is common to both syngas manufacturing trains and is the largest capacity vessel in the process.  The distance to the endpoing is based on the Risk Management Program Guideline for Offsite Consequence Analysis [flammable mixtures, section 5-2 and Appendix C].  Since the syngas is a gas mixture that includes components with significantly different heats of combustion, the method described in Appendix C with Equation C-2 is utilized to calculate the distance to the endpoint.  In accordance with this method, non-flammable components of the syngas are not included.  The distance to the endpoint is calculated at about 0.1 miles [528 feet].  The worst-case release scenario does not impact residential populated areas and environmental receptors.  The worst-case release scenario impacts one public receptor, the Metachem LLC industrial facility immediately north of the site.  The worst-case release scenario is depicted on Figure CP4-3, which is included in a graphic file CP4-3.GIF.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for the flammble substance hydrogen considers a release of syngas through a hole that is  1 sqare inche in area, from a vessel or pipe.
