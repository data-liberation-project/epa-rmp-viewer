This facility complies with the Chlorine Institute and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) requirements for chlorine gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify 911, the City of Apopka Fire Dispatcher, and request response to the emergency.  The City of Apopka's Fire Department is equipped with a HazMat team that is trained and qualified in responding to these emergencies.  A description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.  This facility is a municipal drinking water treatment operation.  Chlorine is used to treat drinking water with a chlorination system as water is pumped into the ground storage tanks, prior to being pumped into the water distribution system.  Chlorine is stored and used from 1-ton (2,000 pounds) cylinders inside the chlorination storage and contol room.  The chlorination system consists of two (2) 1-ton chlorine cylinders on-line at all times.  From the on-line chlorine cylinders, gaseous chlorine is injected under vacuum for drinking water treatment.  A maximum of six (6) 1-ton cylinders (12,000 pounds) are on hand at the water plant.  This facility consists of a small administration building, pumping facilities, two (2) above ground storage tanks and a parking lot.  A chain link fence encloses the facility's operations.The worst case scenario is a release of chlorine from the total failure of a 1-ton cylinder.  This event is unlikely to occur and is presented here as required by the Risk Management Program regulations.  The worst case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a 1-ton cylinder is completely released over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a gaseous release of chlorine.

EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis look-up tables, and results from EPA's RMP*Comp for the distance to toxic endpoint for this quantity of chlorine is 0.1 mile.   The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorination system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) state regulations.  The operators at the water plants are Florida State Certified Professionals.  To prepare for an emergency, plant operators have been trained in both respiratory protection, emergency action and fire prevention.  The operators have many years of experience safely handling chlorine.  They receive updated training regarding operations and safety on a regular basis.  The Grossenbacher Water Plant has not had an accident involving chlorine in the last five years that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the chlorination system or the stored chlorine, it is our policy to notify 911 (the City of Apopka Fire Dispatcher) and request response to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the City of Apopka Fire Department and members of the fire department have inspected and trained on our chlorination system."
