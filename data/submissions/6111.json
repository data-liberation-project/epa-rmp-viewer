Storage, transfer, and use of anhydrous ammonia in ammoniation\n     system\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in two (2) side-by-side\ntanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine inventory in each\ntank is 46,000 lbs.  The maximum process quantity is 92,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in two (2)\nside-by-side tanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine\ninventory in each tank is 12,000 lbs.  The maximum process quantity is\n24,000 lbs., ignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\n3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment has been completed for the EMWTP.  Offsite\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\nprinciple elements:\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for chlorine\n     and ammonia worst-case scenarios.  A leak from a liquid line near\n     the outdoor storage tank was assumed for either chlorine or\n     ammonia alternative release scenario.\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in worst-case scenarios. \n     The excess flow valve, however, was considered for either\n     chlorine or ammonia alternative release scenario.\n\nD.   Distances to toxic endpoints for chlorine and ammonia worst-case\n     scenarios were modeled using a dense gas dispersion model,\n     DEGADIS.\n\nE.

To comply with the requirements in\n40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF FORT\nWORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk Management Program\n(RMProgram) for the EMWTP including Management System, Hazard\nAssessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and Emergency\nResponse Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the employee and\npublic risk of injury, death or damage from accidental release of\nchemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Manager\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nD.   Safety Information Officer\nE.   Hazard Review Update Officer\nF.   Operation Manager/Assistant Operation Manager\nG.   Training Supervisor\nH.   Maintenance Supervisor/Assistant Maintenance Supervisor\nI.   Compliance Audit Officer\nJ.   Incident Investigation Officer\nK.   Emergency Planning and Response Officer\nL.   RMPlan Update Officer\n\nManagement system detailed descriptions and procedures are provided in\nthe Accidental Release Prevention Program to ensure every participant\nplaying a role in the RMProgram understands their responsibilities.\n\n2    REGULATED CHEMICALS AND PROCESSES\n\nRegulated toxic chemicals and processes at the EMWTP are:\n\nA.

Implementation of corrective actions recommended during the most\n     recent hazard review completed on April 22, 1999.  This effort is\n     one of the most important steps for preventing a chemical release\n     or minimize its effects on plant personnel or the public.\n\nC.   Regular review and revision of operating procedures to address\n     the safely operating procedures for regulated process systems,\n     including all eight (8) elements set forth in the regulation. \n     When combined with the operator training program, current\n     operating procedures are essential in  ensuring safe operation of\n     systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\nD.   Regular review and revision of training programs to ensure plant\n     personnel working on or near regulated processes are adequately\n     trained and understand both inherent process hazards and\n     appropriate response actions to accidental chemical releases. \n     Employees who have received adequate classroom and/or on-the-job\n     training and are currently qualified to safely operate the\n     regulated systems have received certifications in writing by the\n     RMProgram Manager.  A special training session will be provided\n     to plant personnel working on or near regulated processes as soon\n     as final revisions to operating procedures are completed.\n\nE.   Regular review and revision of the maintenance program to ensure\n     that current, accurate, and complete procedures are provided for\n     process equipment in regulated processes.  Efforts were and are\n     continuously made for the preventative maintenance"

Effective maintenance\n     procedures are integral to preventing chemical releases that may\n     result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained\n     equipment.\n\n5    THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidental releases of regulated chemicals from a regulated process\nat the EMWTP has occurred in the past five years resulting in any\ndeath, injury, or property damage on site, or known offsite impacts\n(i.e., deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place or property\ndamages, or environmental damages).\n\n6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nCFWWD personnel do not respond to uncontrolled releases of chemicals\nfrom any regulated process at the EMWTP.  Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe EMWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.

Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n     scenario.\n\nThe accidental release of chlorine from a storage tank is considered\nthe worst-case scenario.

The alternative scenario impact distance is 1.5 miles for\nchlorine and 0.38 miles for ammonia.\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, LANDVIEW III estimated a population of\n69,000 persons within the worst-case scenario impact radius of 6.4\nmiles.
