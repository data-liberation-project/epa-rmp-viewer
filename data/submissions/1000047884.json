In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. A PSR is conducted for the following types of changes: equipment, facilities, and/or process chemicals, technology, and software. The PSR serves as a final check prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into the process at a new facility and conducted prior to start-up, commissioning, or engagement of the change, for existing, modified facilities.  The PSSR must confirm the following: a PHA has been performed for new facilities and that PHA recommendations have been resolved; MOC requirements have been executed for changes to modified facilities; construction and equipment installation is in accordance with design specifications; training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed; and, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIncidents, which resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical, are investigated by a cross-section of plant personnel"

The composition of investigation teams varies with the complexity of the incident, but the underlying philosophy is one of employee/contractor employee involvement, as appropriate.  \n\n\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex is a member of the TOP (Triangle of Prevention) Program.  This program is a Systems of Safety process developed by United Steal Workers (USW) Union utilizing a logic tree investigative methodology to determine the root causes of accidents, incidents and near misses.  The TOP program is comprised of three interdependent elements:  1) measurement of the success of the facilityA?s health and safety systems, 2) systems of safety and incident investigation training program and 3) a full-time union health and safety representative program.  The incident investigation process is fully administered by the TOP Facilitators.\n\n\n\nOnce the results of the incident investigation are available, incidents including findings and recommended actions are summarized and communicated throughout the Complex.  The full incident investigation report is available to any employee upon request through the Safety Department or through the Knowledge Management System (KMS).\n\n\n\nAn incident review team, comprised of a cross section of employees, meets on a weekly basis to review incidents that have occurred.  The review identifies important trends, global lessons learned and potential safety issues that need additional attention. The results of these reviews are shared with employees through the Sequential Safety Meeting process as part of the Employee Safety Process.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts compliance audits to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the PSM Program at Pasadena Plastics Complex; to ensure that each program element complies with the standard; and to ascertain whether the programs' internal procedures and practices are adequate and are being implemented.

The PHA schedule is being updated by performing PHAs ahead of the 5 year scheduled requirement so that the timing is alligned with plant outage/turnaround schedules.  This allows for implementation of changes in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nIn 2014 the complex made changes to their work permitting procedures to require permits for all work and will be adopting a program emphasizing 'Life Saving Rules' in 2015.\n\n\n\nThrough 2013 and 2014 various facilities were shut down that utilized chlorine gas for process & cooling water treatment with their replacement being a system that utilizes a solid tablet (not chlorine) as an alternative.  By doing so the site-wide inventory of chlorine was reduced by 10,000 lbs (all in 1 Ton cylinders).  There are projects currently working to replace the remainder of the chlorination systems with alternate and inherently safety technologies within the next two years. "
