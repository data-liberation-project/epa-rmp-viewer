Two, 1 ton chlorine containers are fitted with Halogen emergency shut off devices and gas regulators. Vacuum lines run from the regulators directly to an automatic switch-overr device. From the switch-overdevice, vacuum lines run to the chlorine injectors. The ejectors create a vacuum, drawing chlorine gas from the containers through the gas regulators and dispenses the chlorine gas into the water. Gas flow to the ejectors is controlled by automatic controllers. A typical flow rate is from 150 to 200 pounds per day. In the event of a vacuum leak anywhere in the system the entire system automatically shuts down.",

This update to the plan has been submitted to meet the anniversary date of April 27, 2020.  Previous updates to the original plan have been submitted on-line in 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2015.  Preparation of this document will serve as revision two (2) to the RMP for Chlorine. \n\n\n\nThe Williston WTP is subject to the RMP Rule due to the storage of greater than 2,500 of gaseous chlorine onsite.  Under the RMP guidelines, the Williston WTP is a Program 2 Facility.  As part of this RMP update, plant staff have completed a review of the offsite consequence analysis and updates to the prevention program to promote safe operation of the regulated chemicals at the site.  The facility has also updated emergency response procedures and initiated communication with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department to form a cooperative response to potential releases at the facility.  The prevention program focuses on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards of the regulated chemical and processes. Recent amendments to the original RMP Rule have been addressed in this Version 2 of the Williston WTP RMP.  Deadlines associated with the Risk Management Program Amendments (RMP Amendments) rule adopted December 19, 2019 are summarized below.\n\n\n\n?

Conduct first Field Exercise: According to schedule established between Williston WTP and Local Emergency Response Organization\n\n \n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe Williston WTP is located approximately four (4) miles southwest of the City adjacent to U.S. Highway 85 on the north bank of the Missouri River. In 1959 the plant was constructed on side hill with the Burlington Northern SanteFe Railroad tracks located below the plant. Plant capacity was expanded in 1980 and 2005 the pretreatment system was updated and added ultraviolet (uv)-disinfection.  The plant is currently owned and operated by the City of Williston, with a plant capacity of 14 million gallons of water per day.  The facility is a conventional filtration plant with pre-sedimentation, lime softening, recarbonation, fluoridation, stabilization, and UV/chloramine disinfection.  Gaseous chlorine contained in one-ton chlorine containers is introduced into the water using a vacuum feed system.  All chlorine distribution lines located outside of the chlorine room are low-pressure vacuum lines. If the vacuum is broken on any of the distribution lines the chlorinators automatically shut down. The facility stores a maximum of eight (8) one (1) ton containers onsite, for a maximum combined total of 16,000 pounds of chlorine.  Due to the amount of gaseous chlorine stored onsite, the Williston WTP chlorination system is a Risk Management-regulated process.  Because the offsite consequence analysis shows a potential for offsite migration in the event of a release, the Williston WTP is a Program 2 facility under the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nChlorine containers are stored in the chlorine room, which is located in the lower level of the plant in the southeast corner.  The room is equipped with a high volume ventilation system that starts when the room light is turned on. This system is capable of exchanging one complete air volume per minute.  The Williston WTP operates the facility 24-"

The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.  In addition to the exhaust system, an observation window between the plant and the chlorine room allows the room to be visually checked before entering. A chlorine detector and alarm system are located outside of the room access door. \n\n\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Its boiling point is -29.4&#61616;F.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials.  Contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits by displacing air.  One-ton chlorine containers are welded steel tanks with removable steel protective caps over the container valves.  They are built to meet Federal specifications and are regularly inspected and pressure-tested in accordance with Federal regulations.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nThe owner or operator of a stationary source is required to develop and implement a Management System to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.  This provision requires a clear delineation of the lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility for the overall Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\nThe Williston WTP Superintendent will have overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this procedure.  The purpose of the Management System is to ensure that all parties participating in the RMP understand their respective roles and responsibilities, and that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Williston WTP has examined their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite.

The Worst Case Scenario for this facility involves the release of 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine (the entire contents of one (1) container) directly into the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The facility is located approximately four (4) miles southwest of the City and adjacent to U.S. Highway 85 on the north bank of the Missouri River. The plant is constructed on hillside with the Burlington Northern SanteFe Railroad tracks located below the plant.  There are rural residential subdivisions north and west of the plant at a higher elevation. Across the Missouri River to the south is a wildlife management area operated by ND Game and Fish under the direction of the Army Corp of Engineers. A boat ramp is located on the south bank of the river directly across from the plant. The analysis estimated that a release of this magnitude would create a radius of influence of three (3) miles.  The radius of influence represents the distance the chlorine plume would travel from the facility, under assumed meteorological conditions, before the concentration is reduced below the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2) level, the \"toxic endpoint\".  The USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance states the ERPG-2 concentration \"is that below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" A population of approximately 536 residents resides within this radius.  The USEPA requires that the radius of influence is "

      "SummaryText": "calculated considering a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, or 3.4 miles per hour.  Historically, average wind speed in the vicinity Williston is 10.9 miles per hour out of the southwest; thus, a release would likely disperse at a faster rate than estimated under the RMP assumed conditions.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Williston WTP has also formulated an alternate, or most likely, scenario as part of its RMP.  This scenario involves a release occurring inside the chlorine room.  The Williston WTP utilizes a vacuum-operated chlorination system.  The vacuum system is, for all practical purposes, virtually fail-safe.  A pressure regulating valve is installed directly onto the chlorine container, between the container and the chlorinator.  For this valve to open, a vacuum must be present on the chlorinator side of the valve.  The vacuum is created by water passing through the ejector on the chlorinator.  When a vacuum is present and the valve is open, gaseous chlorine may be drawn from the container, through the valve, into the chlorinator, and then injected into the water.  In the absence of a vacuum on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve closes and chlorine cannot escape through the valve on the container.  In the event of equipment failure on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve is designed to immediately close due to the absence of a vacuum.\n\n\n\nBecause the regulating valve is attached directly to the chlorine container, the most likely potential route for escape of chlorine gas from the container is between the valve stem of the container and the pressure-regulating valve.  The alternate scenario modeled for this facility involves a leak from the lead gasket between the regulating valve and the chlorine container.  Each time a new container is connected to the system, a new gasket is installed.  Although the gasket is checked for leaks immediately after installation, the alternate scenario assumes a small leak is not detected the leak contin"

Because the vessel is inside the building with the door closed, the room acts as a passive mitigation measure and contains the release.  The radius of influence for this release is 0.2-mile, which includes some residential properties and the Missouri River.  A population of approximately 12 people reside within this radius.  In recognition of this potential release, the Williston WTP will integrate Risk Management Program training with its existing training program.  Increased employee awareness of the consequences of even a small release is expected to further reduce the likelihood of such a scenario occurring\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe Williston WTP has not had any incidents that resulted in an injury in the last five (5) years.  The Williston WTP is committed to ongoing employee training to increase awareness of the potential hazards associated with the chlorination process and to further reduce the likelihood of future accidents which may result in injury and equipment or property damage.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe day-to-day result of the Rule is the implementation of a prevention program.  The intent of the prevention program is to document procedures within the facility that promote safe operation of the regulated process and reduce the potential for an uncontrolled release of the regulated substance (chlorine gas).  Components of the prevention program include the assembly of safety information, the performance of periodic hazard reviews, the establishment of safe operating and maintenance procedures, updating training policies, conducting routine compliance audits, the development of an incident investigation procedure, and the formalization of a management system.

      "SummaryText": "cted every three (3) years, at a minimum.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an established compliance review policy for the facilitation of compliance audits, designed to review the facility's compliance with the RMP program requirements.  As required by the Rule, a compliance audit is conducted every three (3) years.  The audits examine the components of the RMP and the implementation of each component.  \n\n\n\nAn incident investigation procedure has been developed to aid in instituting corrective actions resulting from an incident and to prevent future incidents from occurring.  This procedure establishes a timeline for completion of an incident investigation and documents any procedure changes resulting from the investigation.\n\n\n\nLastly, a management system which assigns responsibility for each component of the Risk Management Program has been instituted.  This procedure will also be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in responsibilities at the facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\n\n\nAlthough the potential for a release exists, the Williston WTP has determined that the chlorination system is safe by industry standards and that the potential for a release from the facility is very small.  The Williston WTP does not have its own Emergency Response Plan but is included in the overall local emergency response plan.  As required by the Rule, the City has provided information related to the chlorination process to the local emergency responders.  In addition, the offsite consequence analysis results have been shared.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is working with the Williston Municipal Fire Department and the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to prepare emergency responders in the event of a major release.  The Williston WTP employees do not respond to releases other than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The Williston WTP reli"

      "SummaryText": "es on the Williston Municipal Fire Department and the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Sheriff's Department to manage response procedures in the event of a major chlorine release at the facility.  The results of the offsite consequence analysis have been communicated to the Williston Municipal Fire Department and the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which shares information with the Sheriff's Office.  The Williston WTP has a strong working relationship with local emergency response entities.  The last joint tabletop exercise related to addressing a leak from the chlorination system was completed on April 17, 2019.\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP Amendments, the Williston WTP will continue to coordinate with local emergency responders at least once annually.  In addition, facility is required to schedule and perform the following with the local emergency responders:\n\n?    Joint table-top exercises at least once every three years, and\n\n?    Joint field exercises on a mutually-agreeable frequency.\n\nA report documenting these exercises will be developed within 90 days of completion and shared with both parties.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIn summary, the Williston WTP is confident that although the potential for a chlorine release that could affect the public or the environment is present, it is slight.  The facility has committed to comprehensive training and communication with offsite responders in the event of a major chlorine release.  The facility has examined the hazards associated with the regulated process, identified additional safety measures, and set a schedule for on-going implementation of those safety measures, when applicable.  The Williston WTP intends to continue to use the Risk Management Program as a means to operate more safely and efficiently and to communicate more effectively with offsite responders and the public it serves.\n\n"
