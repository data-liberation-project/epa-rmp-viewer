Secondary response is provided by the City of Lima Fire Department and a variety of local volunteer departments (Perry Township Fire Department, etc.).  The facility maintains a trained fire brigade and hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Allen County LEPC.  The Shawnee Township Fire Department has participated in RMP/PSM orientation/training session for this system (February 15, 2013) and is aware of the process.\n\n\n\nEfforts to improve system safety include a simplified electronic inspection mechanism.  Additionally, Buckeye is currently considering the mandatory use of flame resistant coveralls during off-loading activities.\n\n\n\nDue to remote nature of injection point relative to existing emergency shutoff devices (ESDs), Buckeye is considering additional ESD activation mechanisms.  Buckeye intends to update the local fire department relative to recent system changes."
