The main office is located at 207 East Lincoln Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The subject facility covered by the Risk Management Plan is located at 2650 South Chase Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe subject facility encompasses approximately 149,842 square feet which is divided internally into the following areas: hallways, shipping and receiving docks, fresh sausage kitchen, holding coolers, freezer, packaging, fresh sausage cooler, dry storage room, smoking and cooking room, stuffing department, smoke kitchen and raw meat cooler.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nThe five-year accident history.\nThe emergency response program.\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n1. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish oper"

As a demonstration of KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) `s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop two stage industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n3. The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafework Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Change Procedures\nPS"

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\nA five-year accident history has not been prepared and included in the RMP since the facility is new. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7.

The flexibility of the program allows KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of KLEMENT?S SAUSAGE (CHASE AVENUE FACILITY) employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
