      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of this facility to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the McPherson City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department. Members of the fire department have inspected our propylene oxide system. This facility is a starch derivative manufacturing plant. Propylene oxide is used in the manufacturing process. We have onsite a propylene oxide storage tank, with associated valves, piping, and other miscellaneous equipment. Our worst-case scenario is failure of the storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (8270 gallons.) The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2.0 inch transfer pipe while filling the tank, leading to a 10 minute release of one quarter of the capacity of the delivery truck. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offfsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propylene oxide system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASME standards. We have never had an accident involving propylene oxide that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place."
