The system will sense the break in the line and will not allow the chlorine to continue dispensing.  It will close isolation valves to seal the stored chlorine from adding to the release through the broken line.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seismic switch, the ChlorTainers use nitrogen to power the fail-safe actuator that will automatically close the chlorine supply valve in the event of a chlorine leak outside the vessel. This fail-safe device ensures that all of the chlorine is contained within the vessel until it is safe to resume normal operation.\r\n\r\nBack-up emergency and/or standby power is not required, as the ChlorTainer does not require power to contain gas releases.  A leak in a stored 150 pound cylinder will be handled with a B Kit.  The solenoid valve on the ChlorTainer receives power through the leak detector to the nitrogen valves.  Power is needed for regular operations.\r\n\r\nFuse plugs on the one ton containers are the main relief system for the chlorine equipment.  Fuse plugs are designed to yield and melt between 158\u00b0F and 165\u00b0F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study (February"

The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is chlorine.  The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\r\n\r\n*  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n*  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n*  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n*  Five Year Accident History\r\n*  Emergency Response Program\r\n*  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Huntington Beach Utilities' senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Water Supervisor administers the facilities safety and environmental policies. The Water Supervisor is responsible for various inspections of the facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe chlorine systems at Huntington Beach Utilities are used for the treatment of water used for domestic purposes.  The Huntington Beach Utilities consists of five well stations (6, 7, 9, 10, and 13) which use two one-ton containers, three sites (Ellis/Edwards Hill Reservoir, Well Number 1, and 4) which use 150-pound cylinders and four sites (Overmyer Reservoir, Well Number 3a, 5, and 12) which use a combination of one 150 pound cylinder and one one-ton container.  \r\n\r\nNote:  Well Number 1 and Well Number 12 are currently not in service and do not have chlorine on"

However, the facility plans to re-drill Well #1 and replace the chlorine system at Well #12 with a new system and put both chlorination systems back in service within the next two years.\r\n\r\nEither two one-ton containers, two 150-pound cylinders, or one one-ton container and one 150-pound cylinder are on-line. The on-line tanks reside inside a ChlorTainer, an air-tight enclosed vessel and are each placed on a scale to allow the Huntington Beach Utilities operators to plan ahead for ordering more chlorine. Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  For the one-ton container, a manifold is connected to the top container valve to ensure chlorine gas is drawn out of the container. A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the ejectors.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one ton container or 150-pound cylinder, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping. Any chlorine gas in the tubing upon loss of vacuum, downstream of the regulator, will be drawn through the ejectors and into solution.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one-ton container and/or 150-pound cylinder to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with rotameters to monitor and control the flow of the chlorine gas.  From the chlorinators, the chlorine gas passes through the injectors where it is injected directly into the well effluent and into the distribution system where it is mixed with water.  Once the chlorine leaves either the one-ton container or the 150-pound cylinder, the design of each system is very similar. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nHuntington Beach Utilities has implemented this California Accidental Release Prevention Program to manage the handling of chlorine.

This monitoring system is comprised of excess flow valves, pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor and control operations.\r\n\r\nThe Huntington Beach Utilities maintains tight control of its chlorine processes through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensor / detector, 2) alarms, 3) ChlorTainers, and 4) seismic switch.\r\n\r\nTGO Technologies, Inc. is the developer and manufacturer of the ChlorTainer, a vessel designed to contain the accidental release of liquid chlorine or chlorine gas.  The ChlorTainer is designed in accordance with ASME requirements and is capable of containing pressure releases of up to 250 psig and 300\u00b0F.  In the event of a failed cylinder, the system will protect the operator as well as the external environment from exposure to chlorine gas or toxic levels of chlorine gas. Since the gas is totally contained, it satisfies the code requirement as a treatment system and provides an alternate to the conventional method of mechanical scrubber systems. If there was a small leak from any of the threaded connections, the paint on the ChlorTainer fittings will change color (from yellow to purple), alerting the operator on his daily inspection of a leak.\r\n\r\nIn the event of seismic activity, the systems at the Huntington Beach Utilities sites are equipped with a seismic switch that will put the system in a shutoff mode and automatically reset after t"

To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Huntington Beach Utilities maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all Huntington Beach Utilities employees. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the Huntington Beach Utilities responsible person at least once a year.
