The Berne Plant has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. \r\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (as defined by 40 CRF 68) will be handled in the Berne Plant.  The plant will handle flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating.  Safety precautions are in place when handling flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of personnel, contractors, the community and the environment.  \r\nThe Berne Plant Emergency Response Plan (ERP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The ERP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.

The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. It is assume that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage, i.e. highest heat of combustion, in this case ethane.\r\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved a release of 232,952 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.5 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).  \r\n\r\nAlternative Case scenario:\r\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of natural gas liquids (NGL) had a small leak (1.5 inch hole) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. The alternative scenario is calculated using the chemical with the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL).  The LFL for butane, ethane and propane is 36 mg/L, and pentane has a LFL of 38 mg/L. Thus ethane was the chemical used in the analysis for the distance to the LFL limit.\r\n\r\nRMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to endpoint, wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).
