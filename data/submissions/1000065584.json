      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nAt the FXI, Inc. Plant in Auburn, IN, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce carpet padding, foam for the automotive industry, and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 600,000 pounds.  TDI is unloaded from the top of the rail car to minimize potential spills.  TDI is stored in three 25,000-gallon capacity storage tanks in the tank farm "

      "SummaryText": "with a usual storage not exceeding 60,000 pounds.  TDI is piped to a mix head where is combines with other chemicals to produce polyurethane foam.  In March 2007 a TDI Doper System was installed in the TDI process.  The Doper System involves pumping TDI into a Tank filled with nitrogen gas.  The TDI absorbs some of the nitrogen.  This TDI is then pumped to the mix head to produce flexible polyurethane foam.\n\n\n\nIn the past, TDI was also mixed with other chemicals to create binder. TDI is no longer used in this process. It was discontinued in 2009 when MDI was substituted. The binder mixture is stored in a tank in the tank farm and piped to a holding tank in the re-bond department.  The binder is mixed with shredded polyurethane foam and placed into a mold shell where it is steamed to react the binder.  Both the virgin polyurethane foam and the re-bond foam are cured and sent to various cutting and laminating equipment for processing before it is sent to customers.Again, this process underwent a formula change and TDI is no longer used in the re-bond process.\n\n\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceeds the EPA threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might oc"

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\n\n\nMost people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\n\n\nWorst case release scenarios.  Catastrophic failure of an incoming TDI rail car, having a capacity of 173,400 lbs. TDI, would be a worst case release for a toxic substance because a TDI rail car is the largest outdoor TDI container at the plant.  The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a rail car to 162,000 lbs. maximum to allow space for thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  During cold weather, we pre-heat the TDI to a maximum temperature of 95?F to facilitate unloading and prevent TDI solidification.  During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 100?F.  Because a release at a higher temperature will result in the greatest endpoint distance, we assumed the release would occur at 100?F.  We also assumed that the entire contents of the rail car would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 73,310 -ft2 with a depth of about 0.03 feet (1 cm), and evaporate to form a cloud that would disperse downwind.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts a distance of 3615 feet from the rail car to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/L).\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios.  Rupture of the transfer line from the rail car-unloading pump to the TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at the standard pump rate of 290 lb/min.  We assumed that the release would continue for the 5 minutes required for an employee to stop the pump using remote emergency shutdown controls.  Th"

Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM).  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n\n\n- Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment\n\n- Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n\n- Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n\n- Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n\n- Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes\n\n- Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule\n\n- Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential, are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the company to help prevent recurrence\n\n \n\n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that "

Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and or trained on those changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The plant also conducts periodic tours that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. In 2014 this facility participated in a county wide disaster drill. The scenario was an earthquake had created widespread destruction. This facility was the designated HAZMAT site with leaking TDI.

Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the processes.  \n\nRecent planned changes include in August of 2012 the TDI rail car unloading area perimeter security was improved. Improvements included changes in the procedures that the employee(s) unloading the rail car will first secure the area by closing the large exterior bay door. The bay door will remain closed at all times when there is a rail car containing TDI staged in the rail car docking area. The two access paths to the rail dock unloading area that approach from inside the plant are cordoned off with chain. Signs are posted that TDI unloading is underway. This procedure serves to heighten awareness of all employees and restrict pedestrian traffic in the area to authorized personnel only. \n\n\n\nA second update to the TDI systems safety and employee safety is the installation of continuous TDI monitoring devices in two keys areas. The key areas are the pour line bridge next to the TDI incoming transfer line and over top of the 3 bulk storage tanks. Although there has not been TDI release at this facility, the potential is there for a leak and harm to employees. The technology allows for instant warning as it is set to alarm at very low TDI concentration of less than 4 ppb. Employees have received training that includes steps to take should the TDI alarm sound. Steps include evacuation of the area and the activation of the in house HAZWOPER response team. \n\n\n\nAlso in 2013 the plant leadership team embraced the EPA's National Emphasis Program for potential for worker exposure through inhalation and dermal absorption.
