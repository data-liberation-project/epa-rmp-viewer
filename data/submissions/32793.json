The resources invested in accident prevention such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety and prevention in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes demonstrate this commitment.  Our policy is to prevent releases of substances.   If a release does occur, on-site trained personnel, supplemented by the Hammond Fire Department, Hammond Emergency Management Agency, and Lake County Emergency Planning Commission will respond, if needed, to control and contain the release.\n\n1.2 Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe site manufactures and processes specialty chemicals in Hammond, Indiana.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks, and chemical manufacturing processes are in use at the site.  These are evaluated to determine the regulated flammable or toxic substances which exceed the threshold quantity as set forth in regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).   \n\nThe site uses two regulated toxic substances in two different processes.  The regulated substances, process unit, largest quantity in a single process, and their threshold quantities are shown below in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\nSummary of Regulated Substances\n\n\nRegulated Substances    Process    Largest Quantity In a Single Process  Threshold Quantity\n                                                                              (lbs)                                        (lbs)\nChlorine                        Chlorination                   180,000                                    10,000\n                                    Fuel Additives \nEthylenediamine            Fuel Additives                 90,000                                     20,000\n\n The two chemicals are classified as Program 3 under the Accidenta"

Using the EPA risk analysis format, the distances to endpoints [i.e., Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2)] for chlorine and ethylenediamine exceed the distance to the nearest public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  Dover Chemical - Hammond Works is regulated by to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and operates within a listed Standard Industrial Code (2899). \n\n1.4 General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe site has an accidental release prevention program in place. Processes at the plant regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) are also subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  This summary identifies each of the OSHA PSM and RMP elements and describes the management system in place to ensure accident prevention.\n\n1.4.1 Process Safety Information\n\nDover Chemical - Hammond Works maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to assure safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific assignments are made to ensure there is responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Tables are made available to employees summarizing the reference documents and their locations.  This helps employees to easily locate and use process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and other documents.  For specific process areas, Dover Chemical - Hammond Works has documented safety-related limits for critical process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition).  The process is maintained wit"

Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and evaluate the controls, including the need for redundancy.  The goal is to prevent accidents and releases.\n\nThe site relies on the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to on-site management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking as assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk potential receives immediate attention.  The PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed and the final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, Dover Chemical - Hammond Works periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for the consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, the facility has an array of work practices in place to safeguard worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of personnel, form a system that ensures operation and maintenance activities can be performed safely.\n\n1.4.4 Training\n\nDover Chemical - Hammond Works has a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees in operations and maintenance receive basic training in plant operations or demonstrate that they already have those skills.  After successfully completing training a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own they can work more independently.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skill and knowledge is "
