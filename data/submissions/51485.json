Ammonia Refrigeration System - 42,000 Pounds\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nTargetA?s Lake City, Florida Food Distribution Center T3892 is a newly constructed facility.  This facility is a refrigerated warehouse for the storage and distribution of perishable and frozen food products.   Ammonia will be first introduced to the system in early April of 2008.  Ryan Companies US, Inc. is responsible for construction, startup, daily maintenance, and operation of the facility up until June 1, at which point the system will be turned over to Target Corporation.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving our ammonia refrigeration systems or other facility equipment cannot be prevented by technology-oriented solutions alone.  Safety must be a constant daily concern. Like any other aspect our business, safety must be actively managed and monitored. \n\nThe A?initialA? Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP) in development (April /May 2008) will be living documents, defining the administrative and operational processes to be utilized during and after the facilityA?s turn over, June 1, 2008.  Target also reserves the right to modify and adapt itsA? PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our business processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs are to minimize or eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\n\nA?     Human error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems. \nA?     Human error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system components.\nA?     Lack of knowledge regarding ammonia refrigeration systems and their inherent hazards.\nA?     Inappropriate response to incidents involving ammonia refrigeration systems.\nA?

Unsafe situations inadvertently created by multiple changes over time to ammonia refrigeration systems and other facility equipment or operations which may impact the refrigeration systems.\n\nThe PSM Program Guidelines serve as a reference manual, providing facility team members, both executives and hourlyA?s, specific procedures for implementing the program.  In general, element guidelines describe the following:\n\nA?     Functions of individual elements.\nA?     Repeatable processes to be followed.\nA?     Utilization of employee resources.\nA?     Contingency plans for emergencies.\nA?     Measures to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.\nA?     Method to evaluate risk associated with ammonia refrigeration systems.\nA?     Maintenance and update of PSM elements.\nA? Provisions for feedback and continuous improvement.\n\nThe program is complex and has been developed by integrating facility safety programs with maintenance management, facility operations, and human resources management.\n\nAt the Lake City Food Distribution Center T-3892, Target is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, covering design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Target has proactively partnered with Lake CityA?s Fire Department to provide properly trained and equipped hazmat responders that are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release.   We also will coordinate such events with North Central Florida Regional Planning Council, FL, the local emergency planning commission that services Columbia County for additional support.\n\n2.

The RMP regulated substance present at the facility is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as refrigerant in closed-loop refrigeration systems.  \n\nAmmonia is expected to be added into the system in excess of the threshold reporting quantity in mid April 2008.   The amount of ammonia estimated to be in the system is 42,000 pounds.   \nBased on the size and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nNecessary processes to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 have been implemented and are ongoing.  The facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - \n\nThe newly developed Process Safety Information Guideline contains an inventory list of necessary documents that are in place as of March 2008.  This information will be revised as the newly installed ammonia refrigeration system is put into operation.  This data contains detailed safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis -\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis PSM Guideline and full PHA study for the refrigeration system was completed in March 2008.  The methodology used was the \"What If Scenarios.\"  Representatives from Target, Ryan Companies US, Inc. (Refrigeration Contractor), and Hixson (Refrigeration Consultant) with expertise in"

Safe Operating Procedures are in place that address necessary modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.\n\nTraining -\n\nNew Training PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008, defining training programs for employees working with the ammonia refrigeration systems to increase competence in all relevant operating procedures.  Refresher training is specified to take place at a minimum every three (3) years, and more frequently, as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity -\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008.  Maintenance operations are being carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in ammonia refrigeration system maintenance practices.  \n\nAny equipment deficiencies identified by ongoing maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change -\n\nThe Management of Change PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008. The guideline defines procedures that are in place to manage changes in the ammonia system's technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews -\n\nThe Pre-Startup Review PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008.

The guideline specifies process and frequency for evaluation of PSM and RMP program effectiveness.  These audits are to be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \n\nIn that this is a newly constructed facility, a compliance audit has not been conducted to date.  \n\nIncident Investigation -\n \nNew Incident Investigation PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008 and describes processes to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an unintentional release of ammonia.  These investigations are to identify situations leading to incidents, as well as corrective actions implemented to prevent reoccurring and future releases, with reports retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation -\n\nNew Employee Participation PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008 and describes employee utilization in the development and implementation of the facility's PSM and RMP programs.  In addition the guideline identifies employee orientation, training and communication processes to be followed for educating employees about the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia, and safety programs in place to mitigate risks of injury and accidental release to atmosphere.
