      "SummaryText": "Program Overview:\n\nAt US Amines, we are dedicated to being an industry leader in protecting the environment, the health, and safety of both our employees and the communities in which we operate.  Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a zero incident goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental incidents.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nOur Facility:\n\nWe manufacture several different chemicals in the family of amines.  Our products are used to produce agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and drugs.  Our Isopropylamine is a chemical combination of isopropyl alcohol (the same chemical as in rubbing alcohol) and ammonia (the same chemical as in home floor cleaning products).  This is sold to other chemical manufacturers who make herbicides and agriculture products like popular home and farm product, RoundUp.  The chemicals that we handle and report on include the following RMP listed chemicals: Ammonia, Isopropylamine, Cyclohexylamine, Dimethylamine, and Propionitrile.  We also operate a fertilizer plant owned by IB Nitrogen, that is not covered by RMP.  We have about 45 site employees and 15 resident contractors.\n\nPlant Safety Activities:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.  The staff includes an occupational safety manager, process safety manager, environmental man"

Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.\n\nPlant operators are members of the BEST team (the Bucks Emergency Services Team).  They are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through our Process Safety Management Program.  The Bucks plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  The program meets all of the RMP and OSHA requirements such as:\n*  Develop and implement a risk management system.\n*  Conduct hazard assessments of all processes.\n*  Implement accident prevention requirements.\n*  Develop an emergency response program that is coordinated with local agencies.\n*  Track and analyze incidents to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nPlant 5-Year Accident History: \nRMP requires us to tell the public about accidents involving the listed chemicals that resulted in injuries or serious on-site or off-site impact.  Here is a summary:\n\nAccident  2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007YTD \nRMP        0         0         0         0         0         0\n\nHow We Keep Our Plant Safe:\n\nPeople: Our Most Valuable Safety Resource\n1. All plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs they do.\n2. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n3. A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n \nEquipment: Maintained in Safe Condition\n1. All plant process equipment is subjected to mechanical integrity inspections to look for cor"

A thermographic camera allows us to check for temperature deviations in equipment, check for electrical faults, and verify levels.\n4. Glass level gauges have been replaced with metal, magnetically-coupled gauges.\n\nSafety Systems: Protective Safety Net\n1. All storage tanks and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves, much like the safety relief valve on your home water heater.\n2. Process safety systems are programmed in our process control computers.  If a designated level, pressure, temperature, or other parameter goes out of range, the process will shut down automatically.\n3. Oxygen analyzers protect the integrity of key equipment including various boiler, compressor, and reactor operations.\n4. All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operations, maintenance, engineering, and management review.\n\nPrepared: For Emergency Response\n1. All plant operators are trained in emergency response, fire fighting, and must pass a physical agility test.\n2. The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability, and water reservoir. \n3. The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response, and decontamination materials.\n4. The plant alarm system is tested weekly to ensure that employees know how to use it.\n5. Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR."
