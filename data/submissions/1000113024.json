As such, the ammonia refrigeration systems for the Hinton, VA facility are designed, installed, and operated multiple safeguards per industry specific recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP), including normal and emergency ventilation systems, emergency controls that shut down the equipment if operating limits are exceeded, and PLC controls for system operation. Refrigerant leak detection units and associated alarms are installed throughout the facility to notify employees or offsite personnel in the event of a fugitive ammonia release. \n\nAt this time, there are plans to revise System A engine room. There are also plans to rework the headers and piping system. This was a result of an incident in 2019 of a relief valve failure. VPGC, LLC operates an ongoing program of preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations for the ammonia refrigeration systems. Any corrective actions identified as a result of maintenance activities or Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program practices will be undertaken in a safe and timely manner."

This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the site-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. Accident release prevention has been established through the development and implementation of design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices. The purpose of an accidental release prevention effort is to prevent the occurrence of a highly hazardous chemical incident or to minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In the event of a highly hazardous chemical incident or emergency, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act according to the site-specific Emergency Action Plan. \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVirginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, Inc. located at 6349 Rawley Pike, Hinton, Virginia 22831, is a poultry processing and storage facility, operating as VPGC, LLC. For this facility, the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-loop mechanical refrigeration systems. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration systems provide process cooling and refrigerated warehouse storage capabilities to maintain product quality. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, though, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical.\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the RMP regulatio"
