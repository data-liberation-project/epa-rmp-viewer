Our worst case is a loss of full storage in a 10 minute time frame using RMP Comp as the guide.  The alternate problem is a common potential problem that may occur during application tank filling during peak usage season.  Annual training occurs for all employees that are involved with the product.  We are inspected annually by the Missouri Department of Agriculture and our insurance carrier for safety and other property concerns.  We have employees that have first responder training and are members of the Volunteer Fire Department.  We have not had a reportable accident in the past 5 years.  We also have a plan in place to evacuate the part of our small community that would need to be based on the wind speed at the time of the spill.  We work closely with the local Vol Fire Dept, the local elected officials, and the Bates Co LEPC. "
