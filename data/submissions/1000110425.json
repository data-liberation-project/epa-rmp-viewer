The worst case release scenario assumes that all the content in the largest vessel (i.e. a 10,600-gallon Cargo Truck) is released over a 10-minute period   The release scenario consists of the Cargo Truck being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes that a 2-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the blending process.  The alternative scenario for the Fertilizer Blending covered process considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. excess flow valve or remote actuated emergency shutoff valve on the Cargo Truck; and remote actuated emergency shutoff valves on the MPR), and operating procedures that the Facility and Contractor implement to safeguard against ammonia releases from transfer operations.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer & Logistics Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Fertilizer & Logistics Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Fertilizer & Logistics Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Accident Prevention Program elements.  The Fertilizer & Logistics Manager is responsible for managing the Contractor in accordance with the Facility PSM/RMP Contractor management program.

The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHAE recently acquired this Facility.  Prior to acquisition, the prior owner/operator \u0093De-Registered\u0094 this process.  HAE wants to operate this process so it is resubmitting the Facility EPA registration.  All accident prevention elements have been developed and reviewed.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\no\tCovered Process 1: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\n\nThe Facility coordinates delivery of anhydrous ammonia by Cargo Truck and hires a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor \u0096 IFRC) to transfer and blend anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid and water to make ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer.  The APP liquid fertilizer is blended in a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by the Contractor.  The APP liquid fertilizer is not subject to the PSM/RMP rules.\n\nThe Cargo Truck Owner/Operator is responsible for: transporting anhydrous ammonia to the Facility and staging the Cargo Truck.  The Cargo Truck remains connected to the mode of transportation (i.e. Tractor/Truck) and is considered to be in a status of \u0093incident to transportation\u0094.
