This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant, located in rural Palo Pinto County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\nto recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. \nThe gas plant also recovers the regulated flammables, pentane and ethane.  There are no\nthreshold quantities of toxic substances present.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Lone Camp gas plant. \nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's\n(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this\nsummary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in\nplace to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\nmanagement and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\nthe gas plant accident prevention program"

In\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\nemployee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This\ninfor"

Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\nas well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\nas accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional\nprevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk\nranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented\nand retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five\nyears and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results\nand findings from these updates are documented and retained.

These\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\ntraining of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as\ncurrent and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary\nto reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are\nreadily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to\nsafely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lone Camp gas plant has\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a\nprocess.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already\nfamiliar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is\npaired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators\ndemonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the\nduties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

In combination,\nthese activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health\nhazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable\nsafe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled\npreventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. \nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to\nverify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure\nvessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the\nequipment back into service (if possible), or plant management will review the use of the\nequipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the\nequipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Lone Camp gas\nplant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps\nensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare\nparts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and\nprocess safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing\nactivities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequ"

These procedures (and others), along with training of\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\nperformed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. \nThis system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\n(including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly\nreviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that\nadequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls\nhave not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating\nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these\nchanges.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training\non the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Lone Camp gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. \nThe goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent\na recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings,\ndevelops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant\nmanagement for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's\nfindings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding\nor recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees\n(including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are\nretained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA"
