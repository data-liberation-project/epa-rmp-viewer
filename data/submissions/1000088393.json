(XTO) has a strong commitment to the protection of workers and the environment.\r\nThe Mustang Compressor Station site has an active safety program covering both\r\nemployees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to\r\nprevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO\r\nrecognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including\r\npersonnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of\r\nnatural gas production and gathering systems and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment\r\nis also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls\r\nhave been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely\r\nevent that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to\r\nprovide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is\r\npresent at the site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe facility is located off FM 1776 with the closet town being Coyanosa located in Pecos\r\nCounty Texas. Inherent with the operation of an oil and gathering and stabilization process, the\r\nprocess stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable\r\nsubstances are addressed throughout the RMP, and may include Ethane, Propane, Butane,\r\nIsoButane, Pentane, and Isopentane, which are all components of the Natural Gas Liquids Product\r\n(NGLP).\r\n\t\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\r\nPREVENTION STEPS\t\r\nXTO maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the\r\nSite's processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for\r\nkey pr"

Employees at the Site are active in the development and\r\nmaintenance of up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including\r\nexposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety\r\ndata sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known\r\nconcerns. For specific operations areas, the Site has documented safety-related limits for specific\r\nprocess parameters, such as temperature, level, and composition. The Site ensures that each\r\nprocess is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments,\r\ntrained personnel, and automated shutdown systems.\t\r\nThe Site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design\r\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in\r\ncombination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing\r\ninspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and Site changes\r\nto ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nOperations at the Site have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Employees receive appropriate training in\r\nprocedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes\r\ncontacting trained responders. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based\r\non modifications made to Site processes or other facilities within the Site.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Site is coordinated with the Pecos County Local\r\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings, which\r\ninclude local emergency response officials, and local government officials. The Site contacts local\r\nemergency responders annually with regard to the hazards of regulated substances at the Site.\r\nXTO has implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), elements of which overlap those of the\r\nRMP. \r\n\r\nThe ERP provides the following information:\t\r\n\t\r\nProcedures for informing the public and offsite emergency response officials of a release.\r\nThe individuals and groups contacted, the means by which they will be contacted, the time frame for\r\nnotification, and the information that will be provided is included in the ERP.\r\n\t\r\nThe proper procedures for first aid and medical treatment for employees, first responders, and\r\nmembers of the public exposed to a release.\t\r\n\t\r\nSafety precautions for injured parties and detailed information for medical professionals\r\n\t\r\nInformation regarding who is likely responsible for providing appropriate treatment (e.g., an\r\nemployee, an employee with specialized training, or a medical professional).\r\n\t\r\nProcedures for emergency response in the event of a release of a regulated substance, including\r\ndescriptions of actions to be t"

However, there\r\nis a system in place to investigate any incident that could result, or could reasonably result in, a\r\nfire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal\r\ninjury. The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to\r\nprevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its\r\nfindings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to\r\nmanagement for resolution. Corrective actions potentially taken in response to the investigation\r\nteam's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete.
