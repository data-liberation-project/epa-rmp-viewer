Taylor Farms will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or refrigeration contractor).\r\n\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release. These recommendations along with the priority and time schedule for their resolutions are provided in RMP/PSM program. \r\nImplementation of the measures has begun according to the schedule set by Taylor Farms."

The following areas are addressed in this summary:\r\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n- Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n- Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\r\n- Prevention Program\r\n- Five-Year Accident History\r\n- Emergency Response Program\r\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nTaylor Farms is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program. Taylor Farms has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Taylor Farms policies addressing the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Taylor Farms Gonzales facility provides product cooling, processing and short-term storage for fresh vegetables. This processing includes cooling, cleaning, cutting and packaging vegetables. As part of the product cooling process refrigeration system is used for vacuum cooling, water chilling and ice generation. \r\n\r\nThe facility is located in a rural/industrial area of Gonzales. There are two separate ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility. Part of the System 1 was originally built in 2004. This system is later expanded to it's current set up in 2014. System 1 is used for cold storage warehouse, vacuum cooling and water chilling operations. System 1 is"

Both systems have components that are located indoor and outdoor.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n \r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTaylor Farms Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Taylor Farms is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\r\nKey objectives of Taylor Farms Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1.

Taylor Farms certifies operators following completion of operator training and Taylor Farms confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training chapter.)\r\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\nSecond, all Taylor Farms employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter.)\r\n6.

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Taylor Farms Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\r\n7. Verification of Taylor Farms compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Taylor Farms personnel. Taylor Farms has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \r\n8.
