Allens, Inc. - Fairwater is involved in vegetable processing and freezing (NAICS 311411) and they also have a frozen storage warehouse (NAICS 493120).\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Allens, Inc. - Fairwater is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to manage the risks associated with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to reduce the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage,  handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs reduce accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Allens Inc. - Fairwater consists of three totally independent refrigeration systems.  Engine rooms #1 & 2 are used for the freezing of vegetables.  The main products frozen are green peas and sweet corn.  Engine room # 3 is used to cool"
