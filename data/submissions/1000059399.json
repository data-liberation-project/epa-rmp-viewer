Chlorine is an effective destroyer of pathogens in wastewater. Our employees and their families live here and we are all dedicated to the safe operation of our facility.\n\nPolicy: Safety of employees and the public are of primary concern. As a part of the public service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment. Our programs include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive training and coordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an emergency.\n\nDescription of the Facility: We treat the wastewater for our area. Part of the process requires insuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the public. Chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in our process.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analyses of a Release: In accordance with the EPA rules, an analysis of the impact distance in the case of a release of all chlorine connected to this system was performed. This analysis was made using EPA methods and guidance currently available. Stored chlorine not connected to the system and determined to not be at reasonable risk was not included. Our chlorine system includes automatic monitors with alarms and we have procedures in place to respond to emergency situations. In the event that one of the monitors detects a chlorine leak, there are electric valve operators mounted on each of the active chlorine tanks. If a chlorine level is detected above 1.0 part per million (ppm) the electric valve openers all automatically shut, sealing the chlorine gas within the cylinders.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be represented by the complete failure (rupture) of a one-ton cylinder outside of the chlorine room, releasing 2000 pounds of chlorine into the air. Using EPA's program RMP*Comp and guidance criteria, this release is calculated to take place over"

      "SummaryText": " 10 minutes. At a wind speed of 3.4 mph, the chlorine gas would travel 1.3 miles before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint, the level at which chlorine gas is no longer a hazard to the public. The Mansfield WWTP is located outside the \"urban\" setting but is located in a river valley with many trees and other \"obstructions.\" Depending upon the wind direction, such a release could affect the southeastern quadrant of the City of Mansfield, as well as some rural residents. The potential area is approximately bounded by Ashland Avenue, South Main Street, and Interstate 71. The population within this 1.3 mile radius of the WWTP was estimated to be 4,473 people. This was determined using the \"Marplot\" computer software developed by the EPA and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). \n\nThe alternate release scenario chosen represents a more plausible possibility than the loss of a complete cylinder. This situation involves the failure or damage of the fusible plug on the chlorine tank. This would allow chlorine gas to escape uncontrolled from the valve for an estimated time of one hour. This type of release would occur within the chlorine room, which would provide a reduction in the release rate to the atmosphere. At a wind speed of 6.7 mph, the chlorine gas would travel less than 0.1 miles before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint. This impacted area does not extend beyond the boundary of the facility and no people other than WWTP personnel would be affected.\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator. In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, the EPA and OSHA rules regulate our activities. As part of the requirements of this EPA program, we carefully reviewed our accident history for the last five years and we found that we have operated without a reportable chlorine related incident. We are dedicated to safety and our record proves it.\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with "

We have training every year for our people and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis. Although we take extensive precautions to prevent a chlorine release, we firmly believe in having a plan in case of an emergency. This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid training.\n\nWe are constantly looking for methods to improve. As part of this RMP program, we have reevaluated all of the plant chlorine processes and safety systems with the assistance of a professional engineer. A process hazard analyses and compliance audit have helped us to identify areas of possible improvement and they are being addressed\n\n"
