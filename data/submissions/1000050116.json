We believe that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success. In fulfilling this commitment, we will comply with regulatory requirements and provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Sunoco Logistics employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses.\r\n\r\nThe Mechanicsburg Terminal is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Mechanicsburg Terminal is an onshore, LPG storage facility for pipeline distribution to commercial end-users. This submittal reflects a conversion of the previous butane blending system to propane storage and distribution.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation 40 CFR Part 68, and the OSHA Pro"

The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative case release scenarios. Sunoco Logistics has submitted these release scenarios to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Mechanicsburg Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. This is a \"new\" propane process (converted from butane).  There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Hampden Township Volunteer Fire Company and Cumberland County LEPC (Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency). An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\r\n\r\nThe Mechanicsburg Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and SARA Title III.
