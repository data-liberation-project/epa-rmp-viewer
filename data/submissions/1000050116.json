Sunoco Logistics has submitted these release scenarios to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Mechanicsburg Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. This is a \"new\" propane process (converted from butane).  There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Hampden Township Volunteer Fire Company and Cumberland County LEPC (Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency). An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nThe Mechanicsburg Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and SARA Title III.
