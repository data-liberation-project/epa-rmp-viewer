Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTaylor Farms Express Cooling conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTaylor Farms Express Cooling uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Sheets R0.0 and R1.0 in Appendix A.2* show the facility location map and site plan, respectively.\n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, screw and reciprocating type compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils, pressure cooling systems, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable systems are two half car, one full car, one 1-1/2 car vacuum tubes and one low side re"

Half car and full car vacuum tubes and low side trailer are leased from Western Precooling Systems (WPS) and stay at the site only during the operating season. WPS technicians and operators are responsible in seasonal set-up, start-up, operation, maintenance and daily monitoring of these systems. 1-1/2 car tube (Proper Temp Vacuum Tube) is owned and operated by Taylor Farms Express Cooling personnel and stays onsite throughout the season. All vacuum tubes are connected to main system and don't have high side trailer attached to them.\n\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. WPS Vacuum Tubes are brought to the site during this time only. All of the fixed refrigeration equipment except the evaporative condensers, three high pressure receivers and the diffusion tank are located indoors. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high pressure receivers and two 1,000 gallon nurse tanks during the off season. \n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical room for alarming. There are assigned responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 28,000 lb.\n\nRefrigeration drawings are located in Appendix A.2-System Drawings*.

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1*, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles. In general, the process chemistries for these systems are shown in Section V.A.2*.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4* for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms Express Cooling maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation*.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hour"

Most of the relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient. A recommendation to tie remaining relief valves to diffusion tanks is added to \"Corrective Items\" list in Section VIII**.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms Express Cooling personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries since they acquired the facility in April 2014. \n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N*.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII**. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items.
