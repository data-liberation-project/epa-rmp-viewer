The City of Johnson City Water and Sewer Services Department takes a very serious approach in providing safe drinking water to our customers, treating the wastewater as well as protection of the environment. As a result, the City also take a very serious approach in the way chlorine is handled, stored and used at each of our facilities. All water and wastewater treatment plants use chlorine stored in 1-ton cylinders and each facility has chlorination rooms that contain the cylinders in use as well as additional storage for cylinders not on-line. The chlorination rooms have monitoring alarms to alert the operators should a leak occur.  Private chemical companies transport the cylinders to each facility and are off-loaded by a monorail system to the storage area. The operators at each facility have received training in the safe handling of the cylinders, proper use of personal protective equipment and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) use.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission was a cooperative effort between the water treatment, wastewater treatment, engineering and administration divisions of the Water and Sewer Services Department as well as the Johnson City Fire Department and the Washington County Emergency Management Agency. This plan will become part of the Local Emergency Response Plan for Johnson City and Washington County and will also be submitted to Unicoi County for incorporation into its plan due to the Unicoi Water Plant being located in Unicoi County.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan, as submitted, followed the criteria as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (EPA/CEPPO) and followed the A"

Each facility location was mapped to determine wind speed, direction and plume modeling, using real wind speed and direction data obtained at each facility.\n\nUnicoi Water Treatment Plant\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Unicoi Water Treatment Plant is located on Highway 107 in Unicoi County, Tennessee. The Unicoi WTP is owned and operated by the City of Johnson City Water and Sewer Services Department and produces 4 MGD of potable water for residential, commercial and industrial users. The Unicoi WTP uses liquid chlorine, shipped and stored in 1-ton cylinders, and converts the liquid chlorine to a gas, which is then injected into the finished water for disinfection purposes. After the disinfection process is complete, the water is then pumped into the distribution system for use.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Policies and Emergency Response Policies\n\nShould an accidental release of chlorine at this plant occur, the plant operator is alerted to the release by alarms and the operator will follow the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) Procedures, which are defined in the department's Process Safety Management (PSM) manual. The operator will also notify the Chief Operator at this plant as well as the Superintendent of Water & Wastewater Treatment and will notify 9-1-1 of the release in which case the Johnson City Fire Department, the Johnson City/Washington County Hazardous Materials Team, the Unicoi VFD and the Johnson City/Washington County Emergency Management Agency will respond to the plant site for proper mitigation of the release.\n\n\"Worst-Case\" and \"Alternate Release\" Scenarios\n\nThe \"worst-case\" scenario for the Unicoi WTP is based upon chlorine with a total-release of 2,000 pounds, at a rate of 200 -lbs./minute for a 10-minute duration in a rural setting. This scenario is based upon Table A5-1 "

      "SummaryText": "of the American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF) guide, \"Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants\" (CLW-2). \n\nThe \"alternate release\" scenario for this plant was also based on chlorine, using Table A5-1 of the AWWARF guidebook, but with a different quantity released. The \"alternate release\" scenario is based upon a total release of 317 pounds, at a rate of 10.5 lbs./minute over a 60-minute duration in a rural setting.\n\nWind speed and direction were obtained from actual site conditions over a 60-day time period and these were factored into the plume modeling for both the \"worst-case\" and \"alternate release\" scenarios. The plume models were generated using the Aloha and Cameo programs as developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe City of Johnson City Water and Sewer Services Department is proud of our safety record in handling chlorine. We have not had any accidents using chlorine in our wastewater treatment process at this plant. This accident-free record is due mainly to the emphasis placed on safe handling of chlorine by both management and operators.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Unicoi WTP's Prevention Program is classified as a Program 3 and also falls under the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule. One of the most important aspects of prevention is the training received by the operators and maintenance provided to this plant by our Facility Maintenance Division. Routine maintenance is performed on the chlorine alarms as well as the chlorinators and cylinder regulators.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nShould an accidental release of chlorine occur at this plant, the Johnson City Fire Department, Johnson City/Washington County Hazardous Materials Team, Unicoi VFD and the Johnson City/Washington County Emergency Management Agency will respond to the plant and the LEPC Plan for Unicoi County will be placed into operation. There will be a cooperative use of both Unicoi an"
