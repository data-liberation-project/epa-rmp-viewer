Chemical safety is a number one priority with support from the highest level of\r\nmanagement.  The Environmental and Safety Department reports directly to the Vice President,\r\nwho reports directly to the CEO and President. Thus Senior Management promotes safety and\r\nenvironmental compliance.\r\n\r\n     There are many programs in place to promote chemical safety and the facility is usually\r\nsubjected to at least four surprise inspections a year by different governmental agencies.  The\r\nhazardous waste incineration industry is one of the most highly regulated in the country.  Not\r\nonly does LWD comply with numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Resource\r\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs such as Risk Management Plan (RMP), it\r\nalso complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, Comprehensive\r\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, the Emergency\r\nPlanning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) programs, State and Local Fire Code\r\nprograms, and the National Electrical Code programs.   To even further promote chemical safety,\r\ntheOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs Process Safety\r\nManagement (PSM) and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)\r\nalso regulates the facility. \r\n\r\n     As part of the RMP and PSM programs, LWD's chemical safety program begins with quality\r\nassurance for all equipment, piping systems, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, controls,\r\nemergency systems, and pumps.

An\r\nemployee participation plan ensures that employees are involved throughout the program adding\r\nexperience and a working knowledge of the process to the safety suggestions.  This combination\r\nof engineering, process information, and analysis is supplemented by trained employees working\r\nwith specific operating instructions to address all contingencies to ensure operations are\r\nconducted within safe limits.  \r\n\r\n     The facility has layers of protection built into its process.  The first level includes the\r\npersonnel.  Trained operators are working with operating instructions and process safety\r\ninformation to keep the process operation safe and in environmental compliance.  The second\r\nlevel involves technical controls.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to\r\nmaintain the process within these limits.  Process safety control systems include: relief vents;\r\ncheck valves; manual shutoffs; interlocks; alarms; a keyed bypass; grounding equipment; and a\r\npurge system. \r\n\r\nMonitoring and detection systems include: process area monitors; personal monitors; portable\r\nmonitors; camera systems; special indicator paint; and daily inspections by trained safety\r\npersonnel.  In addition, each shift has a designated trained supervisor to be responsible for\r\nenvironmental and safety compliance. \r\n\r\n     To supplement and enhance these on-site programs, LWD participates in several\r\norganizations which promote safe environmental and chemical practices.

Many of the chemical safety\r\nprocedures mentioned previously are designed specifically for chemicals handled by the facility,\r\nwhich include familiar household products such as paints, adhesives, herbicides, pesticides,\r\ncleaners, and solvents.  Specifically, the Risk Management Chemicals at the LWD facility\r\ninclude Hydrogen Fluoride, Formaldehyde, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, Isobutane, Butadiene and\r\nVinyl Methyl Ether.  Many of these items would be immediately recognizable by the average\r\nindividual if trade names were used instead of chemical names.
