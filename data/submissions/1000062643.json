EWEB's safety and emergency release policies are specifically designed towards prevention through training and employee awareness, which also includes clear and precise methods (SOP's) for mitigating releases to protect its own employees, public and the environment.  \n\n\n\nEWEB's Hayden Bridge Water Filtration Plant has been, and intends to continue to be in compliance with EPA and OSHA requirements for prevention and responsible reaction to chlorine (chemical) releases.  The water plant staff receives annual training on all aspects of the chlorine system, such as safety hazards, operating procedures, emergency action plans, maintenance, operation and data collection for the system.\n\n\n\nAll processes of the chlorination system have approved SOP's with a signature verification that all employees have knowledge and proof of understanding of the system.         \n\n\n\nEWEB actively employs the CENS system for emergency releases if one were to occur.  \n\n        \n\nEWEB is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and attends emergency response drills and training sessions with all local and regional emergency response teams.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Hayden Bridge containment facility can hold up to twelve one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas.\n\nThe facility uses the toxic chlorine gas to disinfect McKenzie River water to produce safe drinking water for the city of Eugene, Oregon.  To disinfect the raw water, chlorine gas is mixed with carrier water inside the disinfection building.  This water is then piped to multiple injection sites throughout the facility. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n\n\nThe di"

      "SummaryText": "sinfection building at the EWEB water treatment plant was constructed in 1997.  The storage / process rooms have redundant detectors, half of which are tested weekly.  If a release is detected, the system closes the vents from the outside and the released gas is blown into a scrubber unit that is designed to neutralize the release.  This scrubber is designed to handle a one-ton release of chlorine and is also checked and tested weekly. The structure itself is built to earthquake codes and fire codes and insulation codes.  All monitoring and control systems are checked and maintained on a regularly scheduled basis.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine feed system is engineered to prevent releases.  Chlorine is fed through a vacuum system.  In the event of a gas chlorine line break in the disinfection building the chlorine feeder or vacuum regulator immediately stops the flow of chlorine gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases in the last five years.\n\n"
