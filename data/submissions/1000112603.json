In addition, the Pasadena PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nThe facility is a member of the Southeast Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety [68.155(f)]\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  Specific changes include the replacement of equipment; upgrading of process piping metallurgy, and additional enhancements to the site flammable gas detection system."
