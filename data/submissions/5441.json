If an accidental release should occur,  the McGregor Company and the Davenport retail facility are prepared to work with the local fire department, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nNOTE: See planned changes to improve safety.\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\no\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as an agricultural grade fertilizer to local farmers.\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one above ground tank(s)  .The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia handled is 130,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.\tAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios   \nThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations. The scenario at this facility would release 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.12. This figure comes from TFI's DEGADIS model.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, is based on the most likely potential incident that might occur at this facility. We used the scenario that a 2 transfer hose would break and release 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles. This figure comes from TFI's DEGADIS model.\n\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammo"

And TFI's Guidelines for Safe Storage and Handling of Ammonia\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\ta.\tThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\no\tHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\no\tHave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Action Policy \nThe facility's emergency action policy was written in accordance with the following\nRegulations:\n\no\tOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\to\tOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120;\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Facility Accidental Release Policy.\n\tThe McGregor Company and its 33 retail fertilizer facilities located in Washington, Idaho and Oregon have an outstanding record on safety and environmental issues. We have an excellent safety and maintenance program and have won several regional, State and national environmental respect awards. Safety and environmental improvements are an ongoing process for the McGregor Company and all of its retail fertilizer facilities.\n\nNOTE:\n\tAs a result of the RMP program the McGregor Company will be developing new plans and policies to protect the people who work at our facilities, our neighbors and the environment. At this time The McGregor Company would ask for an exemption on filing an Emergency Response Plan.  We ask that the McGregor Company be exempt until Dec. 31 1999. We apply for this exemption because of information received from EPA 10th District 112 r coordinator. During this time we will develop a complete written Emergency Response plan for all of The McGregor Co"
