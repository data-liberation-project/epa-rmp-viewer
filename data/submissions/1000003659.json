Mechanical compression and heat exchange cycles occur within the interconnected piping and equipment.  The elements of process safety management are implemented to assure the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.  A PHA revalidation was conducted on 06/01/2009 in order to identify hazards and address them adequately.  \nPrimary safeguards include ammonia detection and machinery room emergency ventilation.   The PSM/RMP prevention program is managed by facility staff to assure system equipment safeguards and industry standards are met to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Mechanical Integrity of the process equipment is maintained through inspections, routine testing and appropriate levels of operator training.  Refrigeration system operators and contractors receive training for safe work practices to prevent all releases, or stop them small in instance when incidental releases might occur. \n",

This principle implies a commitment to provide a safe work environment above and beyond general regulatory requirements.   Reducing the risks and affects of ammonia releases is a primary consideration of the safety programs and planning that goes on during routine operations.  The company employee activities, including safety are subject to key performance indicators.  The organization measures results to constantly improve risk exposure.  The balance of productivity, minimized risk, safety compliance, environmental stewardship and profitability are all part of the measure of success. \nProcess safety program elements are built to overlap with employee health and safety training programs.  An employee emergency action and fire prevention plan is in place to provide safe egress and procedures for employees to follow during emergency situations, whether an evacuation or shelter in place.  Refrigeration employees and facility managers undergo at a minimum awareness level first responder training.  An emergency response plan and emergency response personnel are not in place at the facility.  Emergency response is provided by York County LEPC in the event of an emergency situation requiring outside assistance.\n\nEfforts to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release are achieved by adhering to and exceeding compliance requirements with attention focused on employee training and the integrity of the ammonia process equipment.
