      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary\nFor \nThe Dow Chemical Company\nJoliet, Illinois Site\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at The Dow Chemical Company Joliet, IL Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We are also coordinated with the Channahon Fire Protection District, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing and Distribution.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine], Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] and Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-].  Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is stored at the Marine Terminal.  Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] is used in the Styrofoam( process.  Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is also stored at the Marine Terminal.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] at our facility is 271,141 lb. while Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] and Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] are present at our facility in quantities of 253,674 lb. and 44,022 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls \nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed PHAST 5.01.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as"

      "SummaryText": "a class involves a catastrophic release from Marine Terminal.  In this scenario 29507 lb. of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 3.24 minutes. Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] involves a release from Marine Terminal.  The scenario involves the release of 271141 lb. of Ethylenediamine from the storage tank.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/L of Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is 0.09 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] involves a release from Marine Terminal.  The scenario involves the release of 14040 lb. of Propylene Oxide due to a hose failure during railcar unloading.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by Operator intervention.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the amount of material released.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is 0.02 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenar"

In this scenario 253674 lb. of Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] is released. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.39 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Foam Plant.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 30410 lb. of Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] in 10 minutes. The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Operator intervention.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.01 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good design practices and engineering standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Dow Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Examples of the information maintained are Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals test results, etc.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Dow Chemical Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also required to inform Dow Chemical Company of any hazards they may introduce at the site.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nThe Dow Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release, as defined by the RMP rule, of regulated substances during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nWill County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Dow Chemical Company is subject to, and fully complies with, the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.
