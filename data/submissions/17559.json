Each new employee signs a document stating he/she read and understood the manual.The employees at the WWTP plant do daily,weekly,monthly and annual inspections and maintence on the chemical equipment.

The Safety Director has given the EMS Director the Town's emergency procedures, in turn, the EMS Director has given the Safety Director the county's emergency procedures for hazardous materials.If there is an accidental release the EMS Director or the ranking emergency official will take control.They would be in charge of public notification and evacuation if needed.The Town of Yadkinville started using ton cylinders of CL2 and SO2 i"
