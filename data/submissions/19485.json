      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Evans Houston\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Evans Houston are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Evans Houston facility's primary activities are repackaging and warehousing of chemicals. Evans either repackages or warehouses up to a maximum of 8 regulated substances at our facility.  These substances are listed below.  Evans receives the regulated substances in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Warehouse space is also leased to specific customers.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time.  \n\nChemical                                  CAS No.\nToxic Substances:\n\nEthylenediamine                      107-15-3\nFormaldehyde (37%)                50-00-0\nToluene 2,4 diisocyanate        584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 diisocyanate          91-08-7\nToluene diisocyanate          26471-62-5\n\n\nFlammable Substances (Liquid Form):\n\nIsopropylamine                        75-31-0\nPentane                                 109-66-0\n1-Pentene                              109-67-1\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nEvans is the operator of a stationar"

Evans is a Program 3 level facility because the processes covered under RMP are also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, Evans used EPA's program RMP*Comp to calculate the off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nScenarios for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Formaldehyde (solution).  The scenario involves the release of 17,650 lb. of Formaldehyde (solution) in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  The release is completely contained within a diked area.  Evaporation from that pool within the dike occurs over 60 minutes.  Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/l.\n\nOne alternative release scenario is submitted for each toxic substance that may be present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from a transfer hose failure while loading or unloading from a tank truck.  The scenario involves the release of 2,060 lb. of Formaldehyde (solution).  It is assumed that the release takes place for 5 minutes before it is brought under control. Dikes are used to confine the size of the toxic liquid pool, from which surface evaporation takes place over 5 minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitiga"

The scenario involves the release of 26,000 lb. of Pentane.

The release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion. The scenario involves a 10-minute release of 290 lb. of Pentane.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEvans has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as needed at Evans.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEvans will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEvans promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEvans believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
