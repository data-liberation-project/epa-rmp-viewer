      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nSUPERVALU Champaign Distribution Center is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for its employees and visitors.\n\nIt is important to establish emergency action plans to protect life and property.  Experience has shown that actions taken during an emergency are seldom effective unless planned in advance.  For example, a fire or other emergency could require the rapid evacuation of large numbers of employees from the facility.\n\nIt is imperative that plans to accomplish evacuation quickly, efficiently and safely have been developed and communicated to all employees.\n\nSUPERVALU Champaign Distribution Center is a grocery distribution facility, servicing over 300 retail stores in a five-state area.  Because we store and ship perishable and frozen food products, our refrigeration system is operated using 30,000 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The worst case scenario would be if the largest vessel ruptured, releasing 4020 lbs. into the atmosphere.  This release would effect a 1.14 mile radius with a population of 728 residents.  \n\nThe ammonia system piping has been completely guarded to reduce the risk of accidental damage from equipment.  Any expansion made to the facility, the piping system is installed outside above the roof to eliminate exposure.  The Champaign Distribution Center is covered by OSHA's PSM rule.  We are dedicated to the prevention of catastrophic releases and minimizing the consequences of such release.  Employee involvement, education and training are conducted on a regular basis to maintain employee understanding and awareness of PSM information.  The Champaign Distribution Center has not had ANY reportable accident history in the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program of the Champaign Distribution Center has been developed and coordinated with the LEPC, ESDA and the Champaign and Urbana Hazmat teams.  The local Hazmat teams will conduct bi-annual drills at the facility, along with working knowledge of"

The Distribution Center conducts four emergency evacuation drills on an annual basis.\n\nAny release that registers 200ppm will result in immediate notification to 911.  The Champaign/Urbana Hazmat team will respond to the call, assisted by distribution center emergency responders.  The facility maintains a \"Telephone Tree\", put into effect in the event of an emergency, to notify the community.  An on-site medical facility is staffed by an EMT-I and will be available to assist with any injuries.

The most important aspect is to determine the nature of the alarm.  Movement to exits will be controlled; personnel will not be allowed to run or act in any way to create panic.\n\nArea coordinators will hold head count at the assembly area.

Prior to the alarm, evacuation is a management decision.\n\nDetection and Reporting\nIf fire is detected or the start of the fire is witnessed, it must be reported immediately to the Supervisor.  Delays in reporting fires, because of heroic but ineffective fire-fighting, results in loss of time and can allow a simple fire to spread.\n\nPractice Evacuations and Training\nA minimum of two building evacuation drills and two tornado drills will be held each year.\n\nAssembly Areas\n* Primary \"A\" sites:  Main Office - white sign, Maintenance - Red sign, Transportation/Garage - yellow sign, Perishable - green sign, Grocery - blue sign.\n* Secondary \"B\" sites:  All departments - orange sign.\n\nEvacuation Procedures\nIn the event of an actual evacuation, employees should do the following:\n* Proceed immediately to the nearest exit.

Should an employee strike or observe the striking of ammonia related equipment, supervision must be notified immediately to implement corrective action, minimizing employee exposure.\n\nFailure to report such incidents could result in a delayed response.\n\nEmployees Role:\n1)\tEmployees discovering or observing the breakage of an ammonia line or detecting a strong ammonia odor should immediately report"

      "SummaryText": "n Q.\n\nFacility Description\nSUPERVALU Champaign Distribution Center is a grocery distribution center, located at 2611 North Lincoln Avenue in Urbana, Illinois.\n\nThe structure covers a total of 16.9 acres under one roof, sub-divided into four major segments; Dry Grocery Warehouse, Perishable Warehouse, Truck Servicing Garage and  General Office areas.\n\nOf these areas, Dry Grocery accounts for 569,000 square feet of floor space.  The main hazard associated with this area is the tremendous fire load due to the racking and stacking of palletized dry products in cardboard containers.\n\nThe Perishable Warehouse, home of produce, dairy and frozen food, utilizes 168,200 square feet.  This area is temperature controlled through use of Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant.  Through use of Anhydrous Ammonia, the department is able to control temperatures ranging from 55 degrees in the produce room to 20 degrees below zero in the freezer.  The main hazard in this area is the potential release of Anhydrous Ammonia to the atmosphere in liquid or gaseous form.\n\nThe Garage area accommodates only 12,300 square feet.  The Garage did service all SUPERVALU fleet vehicles, both auto and truck, and contained numerous oil and petroleum base products in quantities less than 60 gallons.  This facility is now closed and the worked performed will be done off site.\n\nGeneral Offices make up the remainder of the square footage.  Located in the front of the main warehouses, the general offices contain the general fire load of any commercial property, i.e., paper, furniture, fixtures, etc.\n\nLocated on the first floor, Northwest corner of the administrative offices, is the Printing Department.  Within this department, small quantities (less than one gallon) of inks and solvents are used on a daily basis.  Larger quantities of these chemicals in 55 gallon drums are stored in the Forward Buy section of the Dry Grocery Warehouse.  Those liquids within the flammable range have been stored in flammable stor"
