We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA description of our facility and the storage and transfer of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n    *An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n    *A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n    *An overview of our emergency response program\n    *An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur public marine terminal stores and transfers a variety of chemicals. The facility stores the chemicals in pressurized tanks and transfers them to and from various transportation modes including tank truck, rail car, barges and ships.  The processes are storage and transfer only.  The storage and transfer consists of three processes:\n\n    *Toxic and other flammable Storage and Transfer\n    *Propylene Storage and Transfer\n    *Acetaldehyde Storage and Transfer\n\nThe systems and procedures for storage and transfer of propylene and acetaldehyde are specific to those chemicals and  therefore are identified as separate processes. The systems for storage and transfer of other flammables and all toxics are the same basic design and use the same procedures.\n\nWe have identified the following toxic che"

Only a fewl of these chemicals are currently stored at our facility.\n\nWe have identified the following flammable chemicals that have the  potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: propylene , acetaldehyde, isoprene, \n1-pentene, and isopropylamine. Only a few of these chemicals are presently stored at our facility. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment in the storage and transfer of these chemicals\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: Process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit procedure and contractor safety.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1.  All tanks are pressurized with two levels of pressure relief with the first relieving to an abatement device at 80% of design pressure;\n2.  Temperature, pressure and level instrumentation including alarms. ;\n3.  All key parameters are monitored in a central control room;\n4.  All operations and maintenance employees are trained to the technician level of HAZWHOPER;\n5.  Systems are pressure tested before chemicals are introduced;\n6.  Sys"

Systems integrity is checked at frequent intervals during static conditions both by sight, sound and smell and an analyzer.\n8.  A central control room was installed and made operational. All important parameters are monitored and alarmed on all tanks. Logging of the parameter trends is also included allowing the parameter trend to be analyzed over a 30 day period. \nIn addition the Propylene and Acetaldehyde Storage and transfer systems have:\n\n1.  Spheres designed and built to the ASME Code;\n2.  Automatic Shutdown;\n3.  Area leak detectors; and\n4.  All components are dedicated to propylene and acetaldehyde service.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the last five years there  have been two accidents as a result of chemical releases. Both accidents were chemical  exposures in 2000 and 2003 resulting in restricted duty for less than a week.\n\nFor each of these incidents, we conducted  root cause analyses to identify and correct the root causes of  the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response and contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and we are members of the local Mutual Aid Association. Elements of"

Further development of the control room function to include the ability to close the automatic valve in the fill line on select systems \n2. Automatic valve  in inbound line operable from the control room to prevent overfill on select systems \n3.
