This RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Area 2. \n\nThe RMP for Area 2 was last fully updated and re-submitted in January 2018 under ALON.  Certain equipment in Area 1 was de-inventoried and has been suspended prior to the latest RMP update and does not currently contain any RMP-regulated substances. \n\nThe purpose of the risk management program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\" that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  \"Regulated substances\" are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.  BKRF has quantities of \"regulated substances\" above the threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BKRF\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BKRF\nSection 3: Worst-case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BKRF Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\nSection 1:  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BKRF\n\nEquipment at the various units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

Written policies and standards are in place to ensure:  \n\n* The safety and health of employees and other workers at the site;\n* Protection of the environment;\n* Reliable and efficient operation of the facilities;\n* Minimization of the risk of product or property losses; and\n* Maintaining a positive relationship with the communities adjacent to our facility.  \n\nThese written policies and standards are discussed further elsewhere in this submittal.\n\n\nSection 2:  Overview of Regulated Substances at BKRF Area 2\n\nBKRF began operations as Mohawk Petroleum in 1932.  Under different owners, regular expansion and improvements of facilities have occurred over the years, including the integration of an adjacent refinery in 1986 that doubled gasoline production.  In 1998, the refinery became a part of Equilon Enterprises, LLC, a joint venture of Shell Oil Company and Texaco Inc.  Shell Oil Products US acquired Texaco's interest in 2002.  On March 16, 2005 Big West of California, LLC acquired interest in the refinery.  Alon Bakersfield Property, Inc. took over the site in 2010. Bakersfield Renewable Fuels under the parent company took possession of the refinery in 2020 and began retooling to a renewable fuels facility Several units previously reported in 2012 Risk Management Plan submittal to the U.S. EPA have been de-inventoried, or the inventories have been reduced.  \n\n\nSummary of Covered Process Units below lists the covered process units that are subject to the federal risk management program, defines the appropriate RMP program level, and identifies the regulated substances handled in these units.\n\n\nSummary of Covered Process Units - BKRF Area 2\n\nUnit: Steam Systems/Boilers: Boilers (Unit 81) and 20-H11 Steam Methane Reformer (Unit 20)\nUnit 81 generates steam that is di"

The results of the analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in their emergency response planning.\n\n3.1 Worst-case Scenarios\n\nBKRF conducted offsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines\" (OCAG).  This methodology was used because the RMP rule set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  The worst-case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nA worst-case release scenario is defined as the scenario that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified \"endpoint\", (ERPG 2).  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for toxics substances is a specified concentration, and for flammables is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  \n\nThe WCS for a regulated toxic is one where the total quantity in the largest vessel or pipe is released over 10 minutes, resulting in acute health effects associated with airborne exposure.  For a regulated flammable, the WCS is one where the total quantity of regulated flammables in the largest vessel or pipe is assumed to vaporize and instantaneously result in a VCE.\n\nA summary of the WCS for BKRF Area 2 is provided below.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are shown for one vessel containing a toxic substance (anhydrous ammonia). These scenarios produced the greatest distance to their respec"

BKRF has used the hazard and operability study methodology with LOPA as the refinery's primary PHA technique.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\nIn order to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, BKRF updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every 5 years.  \n\nA seismic review of the refinery was conducted as part of the technical studies.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walkthrough was conducted in 1995 by a qualified engineering company for Texaco, the previous owner.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having offsite consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nBKRF has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as references by experienced operators and for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nBKRF's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.

The procedure does not apply to \"replacement in kind,\" which is defined as replacements that satisfy the design specifications and are functionally identical to the item being replaced.\n\nThe MOC process is intended to assess the impact of proposed changes on process safety, the environment, operability, reliability, and product quality in process units.  The requirements for MOC are documented in a written procedure.  MOC information is kept for the life of the process unit.\n\n4.6  Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional assurance that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The pre-startup safety review also verifies that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nPre-startup reviews are governed by a written pre-startup safety review procedure and cover a variety of issues, including:\n\n* Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n* Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\n* For new facilities, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup;\n* Modified facilities have complied with MOC requirements, including updating the PSI (e.g., piping instrument diagrams, opera"

BKRF maintains a certification record that each inspection and test has been performed, which includes the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector and test, and the serial number or other identifier of the equipment.  Every recommendation made by an inspector is resolved and documented.  In so doing, BKRF will correct deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits (as defined by the PSI) before further use, or in a safe and timely manner that ensures safe operation.\n\n4.8  Compliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, BKRF conducts audits every 3 years to ensure that the accident prevention program is being implemented.  The audits include an assessment of written prevention program elements, retained records (e.g., training records, completed hot work permits), and personnel interviews to assess level of implementation for the prevention program.\n\nCompliance reviews are performed by trained, expert personnel.  Action items or recommendations resulting from the various audits are tracked to completion through a computerized database.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\n\nThe BKRF accident investigation program covers four types of incidents:\n\n* Personal injury;\n* Environmental release; \n* Equipment damage and loss of production caused by fire, equipment failure, or other circumstance; and\n* Those incidents that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic event.\n\nThe goal of an investigation is to determine the facts associated with"

Corrective measures and action items resulting from an investigation are tracked to completion in a computerized database.\n\n4.10 Employee Participation\n\nAll BKRF employees have the right to participate in the development and conduct of PSM activities as stated in the risk management and PSM regulations.  It is the policy and practice of BKRF to encourage employee participation in all aspects of accidental release prevention elements. \n\n4.11 Safe Work Practices\n\nBKRF safe work practices include hot work, confined space entry, lockout/tagout, first line break, and various other types of work covered under a Company Safety Permit.  \n\nThe BKRF hot work permit certifies that the various portions of fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning hot work operations.  This procedure documents the date(s) authorized for hot work, identifies the equipment on which hot work is to be done, and ensures that all personnel involved in permitting are trained on this procedure. \n\n4.12 Contractors\n\nContractors at BKRF are selected based on their past safety performance, their current safety programs, and their conformance to the BKRF Refinery Safety Rules and Regulations.\n\nThe BKRF Refinery Safety Rules and Regulations provides contractor employees safety information, including entrance and exit procedures, safe work practices and work permitting procedures, emergency action plans, PSI, and contractor injury/illness reporting.  \n\nBKRF also requires annual contractor orientation training, which includes information on the emergency action plan, potential process hazards, and site safety rules.  Proof of training is provided via renewable access cards.\n\n\nSection"
