This commitment\nis demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of\nour processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel\nwill respond to control and contain the release. \n\nB) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Silo Plant; located 25 miles northeast of Cheyenne, Wyoming (1 mile south of the\nintersection of county road 222 and 136); incorporates a variety of processes to produce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, pentane) from oil and gas wells.\nThe Silo Plant handles methane; ethane, propane, pentane and butane which are regulated\nflammables. It processes approximately 10 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and\nnatural gas liquids.  The Silo Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity\nof toxic regulated substances.\n\nC) Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes\nat the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest process vessel containing 140,000 pounds of a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) mix. The\nmaximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.09 miles.  No passive mitigation\nmeasures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nE) Five-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have not had an accidental release that caused\noffsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n D) General Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specif"

      "SummaryText": "ic Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Silo Plant.\nAlthough processes at the Silo Plant are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP)\nregulation, they are not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This\nsummary addresses only general safety issues and describes the management system in place\nto implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n1) Safe Work Practices\n\nThe Silo Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and\nprocess safety. Examples of these include:  \n(1)  lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is\nbeing worked on \n(2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment\nis opened \n(3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work)  \n(4) A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry\ninto a confined space. \nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to\nhelp ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n2) Incident Investigation\n\nThe Silo Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal\ninjury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective\nactions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigator\ndocuments his/her findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards\nthese results to Southeast Colorado management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in\nresponse to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they\nare completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and\nthe investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could\nb"

Compliance audits are conducted\napproximately every 3 years.  Personnel from other operating areas compose the Audit Team.\nBoth hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops\nfindings that are forwarded to Silo Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\ntaken in response to the audit teams findings are traced until they are completed.  The\nfinal resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are\nretained.\n\n4) Summary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Findings\n\nThe processes at the Silo Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe\noperations.\n\n                a) Universal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the EPA RMP covered\nprocess at Silo Plant.  This prevention program helps prevent potential accident scenarios\nthat could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nb) Specialized Safety Features\n\nThe Silo Plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly\ndetect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following\ntypes of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n                \n        1) Release Detection\n\na. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n\n        2) Release Containment/Control\n\na. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\nb. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high level, high\ntemperature, high pressure)\n\nc. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\nd. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n        3) Release Mitigation\n\na. Personal protective equipment\n\nb."

Emergency shutdown strategically placed in the plant to automatically shut in the inlet.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Silo Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect\nworker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures\nfor responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire\nor explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all\naspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for\nexposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification\nof local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident\ncleanup and decontamination procedures. The emergency response program is updated as\nnecessary.  Any significant changes to the emergency response program are identified and\naffected personnel are informed of the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Silo Plant is coordinated with the Laramie\nCounty Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This\ncoordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes local emergency\nresponse officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Silo\nplant operator has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC\nofficials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a\nmeans of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick\nresponse to an incident. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAlthough Silo Plant Management does not believe additional safety measures are necessary to\nprevent offsite impacts from accident releases, it does resolve all findings from the\nSafety and Environmental Compliance Audits."
