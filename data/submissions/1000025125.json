Conducting business in a manner that wins public confidence and meets the environmental and economic needs of the communities we serve is critical to our long-term success. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities, as well as in the training or our employees. Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nINEOS Polypropylene, LLC is co-located with the BP Carson Refinery in the city of Carson, California. The INEOS site employs approximately 40 people.  The INEOS plant processes propylene gas from the BP Carson Refinery to make polypropylene.  The site has been manufacturing polypropylene since 1999 and has capacity for storage in excess of 25 million pounds; the site produces more than 450 million pounds of product per year.  \n\n\n\nThe INEOS site has one covered process, a flammable mixture of propane and propylene.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the INEOS Polypropylene LLC site.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and operating procedures to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams. Employees have access to all PSM-related information per an internal document control process.  INEOS has a number of programs underway that address employee safety issues.  INEOS employees have also received training to enable them to observe fellow employees in order to identify and correct behaviors that may lead to accident or injury.  Other means by which employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in written programs maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Polypropylene LLC site maintains extensive documentation that is used to help maintain safe operation of the production process. This documentation addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information. \n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response information is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) are documented. INEOS ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nINEOS also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.

The polypropylene process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The site uses the HAZOP (hazard and operability) analysis method and other approved Process Hazard Analysis methods to perform these evaluations.\n\n\n\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents involving accidental release or potential for such, engineering and administrative controls and failure of such, and human factors will be addressed by the team performing the hazard analysis. The findings and recommendations of the team are submitted to area management to assess the likelihood of the potential hazards, assess the severity of the consequences from potential releases, and assign priority for implementation of recommendations. The recommendations and progress towards implementation is followed using a computerized tracking system. The final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, INEOS periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation. The results and findings fro"

The operating procedures are available to employees working in or near the covered process area.  The operating procedures are reviewed by supervision before scheduled activities (e.g. scheduled start-ups and shutdowns, scheduled on-line maintenance) are completed and when supervision believes that the current procedure should be modified to better execute the planned activities.  Critical procedures such as unit emergency procedures are reviewed annually during annual training sessions.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nINEOS Polypropylene LLC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining the covered process.  Initial training includes health and safety training, an overview of the covered process, and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is also given to operators assigned to an operating unit. This training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the operator?s job tasks.\n\n\n\nJob specific training includes on-the-job training, a written manual, written tests, observations, and written sign-off. The site also has ongoing refresher and supplemental training for all personnel. Testing is conducted for all job specific training. Once an operator is qualified in a position, they are required to recertify for the job every three years. Testing is conducted on all OSHA-required safety and health training.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about site safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. Additionally, all contractors that work on site must have completed an orientation training that provides a standardized baseline of safety and health training for all contractors.  Recertification to demonstrate knowledge of the required subject areas is required every two years. In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as one of the key criteria for selection of a contractor to perform work. Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nA pre-startup safety review is conducted at the site for any new/modified facilities where modification necessitates a change in the process safety information. The pre-startup review is used to confirm that prior to the introduction of hazardous materials to a process, the following take place: 1) construction and modification are in accordance with design specifications and applicable codes; 2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; 3) training of each operating employee and maintenance worker has been completed; and 4) process hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved or actions necessary for startup have been c"
