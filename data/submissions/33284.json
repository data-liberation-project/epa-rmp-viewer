      "SummaryText": "Cessco, Inc. is a small aerosol filling company located on rural Johns Island, SC.  Currently, Cessco, Inc. employees nine (9) people, including management and owners.  When Cessco, Inc. relocated its plant facilities in 1991, it purposely sought a more isolated location.  In determining the propellant tank location sites, the tanks were placed at the furthest possible distance from homes or offices.  Being a small, close knit company, management makes every effort to provide a safe working environment.  Monthly safety meetings are held, and management and plant personnel interact equally.  Every employee has received and been certified in Hazardous Materials HM0181F/126F Training.  Last training and certification was completed on site July 13, 1999 by HAZCOM of Salem, Virginia.  Cessco also received regular courtesy visits from the St. Johns Fire Department, as the fire department periodically uses Cessco's plant and grounds for the training of their new firemen.\r\n\r\nCessco, Inc. manufactures insecticide aerosols, insecticide liquids, and liquid cleaning products.  Cessco, Inc. formulates and fills its own EPA registered products and also contract fills for other companies.  All products formulated are from EPA Approved Confidential Statements of Formula.  The concentrated active ingredients used in various formulas are Pyrethrum, Piperonyl Butoxide, D-Trans Allethrin, Permethrin, Tetramethrin, Chloropyrifos, and DDVP (vapona).  These active ingredients are blended with solvents, those being Isopar M, LPA 210, BVA XK 45, Exxate 1300, Odorless Mineral Spirits, Hi-Sol 10, and Sponto AK 3138.  Propellants used to fill the aerosols are HFC-134A (non-flammable) and Hydrocarbon A-70 (flammable).  All of the chemicals except for 134A and A-70 are brought into the plant in 5, 30, or 55 gallon containers.  134A and A-70 are received in bulk and put in storage tanks located on the northeast side of the plant property.\r\n\r\nCessco, Inc. currently complies with the rules and reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulations set forth by the EPA, DOT, OSHA, DEHEC, and local agencies.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses on repeated training of employees (daily hands-on training).  Before any start up of any equipment, it is required that all pumps, compressors, pressure gauges and pressure relief valves are inspected.   Back-up and prevention systems are as follows:\r\n\r\n\t1)\tEmergency shut-off systems for electrical, piping, and pumps.\r\n\t2)\tBackflow prevention valves.\r\n\t3)\tExcess flow valves.\r\n\t4)\tPressure relief valves.\r\n\t5)\tBreak away piping.\r\n\t6)\t20 PSI blow out panels.\r\n\t7)\tSprinkler systems.\r\n\r\nCessco, Inc. has had no accidental releases in the past five (5) years.\r\n\r\nCessco, Inc.'s Emergency Response Plan is coordinated directly with the St. John's Fire Department and HAZMAT Response Team.  The nearest fire department is 2.5 miles away and response time is five (5) minutes or less.\r\n\r\nCessco, Inc. will continue hands-on training of its personnel and monthly safety meetings.  There are no changes planned for the emergency shutdown and prevention systems that are now in place.  Our biggest challenge is keeping up to date on the many rule changes that take place with the various government agencies.  Plans are in process to contract with a consultant of Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety to assure that the company stays up to date and in compliance with the rules and regulations of EPA, DOT, OSHA, DEHEC, and local agencies."
