      "SummaryText": "VWR International, Inc. (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved containers (typically ranging from 1 gallon to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well-being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements, that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring, and in the event a minor or major emergency does occur, to enable facility personnel to effectively manage the incident. \n\nAll warehousing operations involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \"covered process\" for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covered under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10(c)) because New Jersey does not recognize Program 1 and VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.  \n\nAt the present time, only Hydrochloric Acid solution (>36%) exceeds the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under the revised New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA) with an estimated maximum quantity of 14,000 lbs as compared to the NJ TCPA TQ of 5,600 lbs.  VWR is also predictively filing for chloroform, even though at most times the quantity of chloroform is less than the TQ of 20,000 lbs.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Off-Site Consequence scenarios were analyzed for both hydrochloric acid and chloroform using the same considerations.  This is becau"

RMP Comp, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility that toxic effects may be anticipated, following the chemical release.  This is known as the distance to the \"toxic\" endpoint.  \n\nResults of the worst case analysis indicate that all distances to endpoints are relatively small.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for hydrochloric acid was determined to be approxiimately 0.7 miles.  The worst case distance for chloroform was 0.1 miles or less.  There are no residences, schools or hospitals within that distance, although a few commercial industrial establishments exist within that radius. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a more realistic hypothetical incident in which a single 4-liter (approximately 1 gallon) container of chemical is dropped on the floor.   According to the analysis, the distance to the toxic endpoint was equal to one-tenth of one mile (0.1 mile) or less for both hydrochloric acid and chloroform. \n\nAdministrative controls and active mitigation measures were not included as a factor of consideration during the worst case or alternative release scenarios.   However, release inside the building, as well as passive mitigation measures (i.e., enclosures and berms) were included. \n\nVWR's prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n\n* Safety Information - includes detailed information about the hazards of regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenan"
