EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n       The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calvert City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (formerly Chemical Manufacturers Association) and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care? to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Calvert City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at ISP's Calvert City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Calvert City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n1.1        Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n       The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid Association, Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid "

The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worstcase scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ISP does not expect a worstcase release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the ISP Plant.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help improve the community emergency response plan.  We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  Additional information can be obtained by calling the Environmental or Safety Departments at (270) 395-4165.\n\n\n\n       The main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\n\n\n?
