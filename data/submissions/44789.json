      "SummaryText": "The Western Canyon WTP is a surface water treatment facility owned & operated by GBRA. The water plant is located approximately 3 miles North of  SH 46 on FM 3159. Chlorine is the only RMP listed hazardous chemical (gas) on site with the maxmium quanity of 8,000 pounds or 4 one ton containers. Only two containers are setup for use at any given time, with one container actually having chlorine drawn from it for disinfection of the water. The gas is drawn off the container under a vacuum. If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a valve located on the chlorine container is automatically closed, stopping flow of the chlorine gas thus reducing the chance of a chlorine release.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine involves a release of  330 pounds / minute for 10 minutes with the wind speed of 1.5 meters/ second. Radius of impact within the 1.6 miles rural setting includes the Waggener Ranch Subdivision which includes approximately 25 homes (75 persons). No hospitals, major industrial buildings, or  schools are located within the impacted area.\n\nThe altervative release secnario  involves a break on a 3/8 line connected to the chlorine container. Given a release rate of 297 lbs/min for 10 minutes, 2,970 lbs of chlorine could be released impacting a radius of 0.2 miles. Within this area is a population of 75 persons with no hospitals, major industrial buildings, or schools.\n\n The probability of the alternative scenario is very low since the involved break or leak between the source of vacuum and the vacuum actuated valve, that automatically closes upon loss of vacuum. Any break sufficient to release chlorine gas would stop the vacuum, closing the vacuum actuated valve.\n\nGBRA  does not fall under OSHA regulation, however GBRA does follow OSHA guidelines and regulations on safety issues. Therefore, the OSHA PSM rule along with others is used for guidance when developing and implementing prevention and audit programs. Operations personnel have completed a Texas A&M Firs"
