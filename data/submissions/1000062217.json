It is the intent of the Caddo Mills Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA # 58-2011 Edition) into this process. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Caddo Mills Volunteer Fire Department as well as the Hunt County Emergency Management. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (Hunt County EMS) and Presbyterian Hospital of Greenville.\r\n\r\nThe Caddo Mills Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and the two 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels.\r\n\r\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate (potential for off-site impacts) release scenario is a release from pipe and associated vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nThe Caddo Mills Terminal will comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Energy Transfer Partners-Butane Blending) instructions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nThis facility has nev"

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with fire department and Hunt County Emergency Management. The Caddo Mills Volunteer Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system, and invited to additional training sessions.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250oF) pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, grounding interlock devices, hydrocarbon detection and ESD tie-ins, and vessel pressure reliefs.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Sunoco looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, the Caddo Mills Volunteer Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills which will involve potential releases."
