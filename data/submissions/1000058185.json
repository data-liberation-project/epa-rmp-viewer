Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity:\n\n\n\nEthene (CAS #74-85-1)\n\n\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no major accidents associated with the process.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source include safe operating procedures and a well trained workforce, along with an emergency response plan and hazardous materials response team.\n\n\n\nSince the previous RMP submittal, Airgas has implemented a system of bunkering (fire walls) in order to limit the quantity of Ethene stored in any process area.\n\n\n\nAirgas USA, LLC has developed and implemented a Program 3 Risk management Plan for the above identified process as described in this submittal. All documents pertaining to the RMP are kept on-site and updated as required."
