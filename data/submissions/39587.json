              "Description": "Chlorine\nThe chemical feed process for chlorine has two containers of chemical attached to the feed system at one time. The covered process contains 4,000 pounds of chemical. This volume of chlorine is above the threshold values, for reporting under the CAA.\n\nIn this covered process, the system feeds from one container until the container becomes empty, and then automatically switches to the other container on line. This is accomplished with a component termed a \"Switchover Valve\". The remainder of the inventory is in storage, in the same room.\n\nAccess to the WWTF is restricted to authorized personnel only. Persigo WWTF operations and maintenance staffs are thoroughly trained regarding the hazards and risks associated with chlorine. Specific regulatory operation and maintenance procedures are in place and are strictly followed. Procedure and personnel audits are performed quarterly at this facility to identify hazards or risks which may have been overlooked or not previously identified. These audits are also used to identify any deficiencies in personnel safe work practices of the procedures.\n\nThe chlorine building is locked 24/7 except when personnel are present performing duties. The fire department has a locked box at the main gate, which contains a card to open the main gate and a door key for all of the facility buildings.\n\nThe feed process for chlorine is under vacuum feed, which reduces the risk of a chemical release. The flow of chemical is shut off in the event of a leak in the vacuum system and helps to prevent a release of hazardous chemical. \n\nOperators check the hazardous chemical feed system daily and a scheduled maintenance program is in place. Chemical release detection sensors are located in the feed and storage rooms to set off alarms if a release is detected. The chlorine alarms at the chlorine building turn off the heating and ventilation systems, sound an alarm, and activate a strobe light outside of the building. This light is visible from work areas near the chlorine building. The alarm is also detected in the operations building. After working hours, the alarm activates the automatic phone dialer and key personnel are called. Specific procedures are in place for after hour's alarms, and all plant operators have been trained to carry out these procedures in the event of an alarm after normal working hours. The policy and procedure manual is reviewed and updated annually.",

The ingestion of hazardous chemicals by humans in sufficient quantity will result in loss of life or serious injury. Chlorine is on the hazardous chemical list. The Persigo Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) has more than the threshold quantity of chlorine on site. The Clean Air Act, 40 CFR 112r Part 68, requires us to comply and to observe specific safety precautions in handling this chemical. Release prevention and emergency response policies are in place to help prevent exposure to facility personnel and the community, given the life, health, and safety hazards associated with chlorine. It is the policy of the City of Grand Junction to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules, regulations, and safety precautions. \n\nThe primary purpose of the Persigo (WWTF) is to treat wastewater produced in the Grand Junction 201 sewer district area. Following other wastewater treatment processes, chlorine is added as a disinfectant, prior to discharging the treated effluent into Persigo Wash, which flows into the Colorado River.\n\nIt is the management's opinion that the Persigo WWTF Emergency Action Plan is in compliance with OSHA's Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan, 29 CFR Part 1910.38. The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the Grand Junction Hazardous Materials Team (Haz-mat) to respond to all hazardous chemical releases at this facility, and to notify all potentially affected neighbors.\n\nPersigo WWTF receives chlorine by truck transport. Chlorine is stored in the \"chlorine\" building. The chemical is in liquid/gaseous form. Each container has 2000 lbs. of chemical.\n\nAccess to the WWTF is restricted to auth"

The facility was designed and constructed in 1984 in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and local building codes. Equipment and components related to receiving, feed process and final discharge of hazardous chemicals are inspected daily and maintained according to manufacturer recommendations. Persigo Wastewater treatment plant staffs have been trained to follow specific operational and maintenance procedures while handling hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe feed process for chlorine was updated in 1995 to reduce the risks of a release: 90% of the plumbing system is now under vacuum feed, which reduces the risk of a chemical release. The flow of chemicals is shut off in the event of a leak in the vacuum system and helps to prevent a release of hazardous chemical. \n\nPlant personnel check the hazardous chemical feed system daily and a scheduled maintenance program is in place.

There has never been an accidental release of chlorine since the plant was built in 1984. \n\nEmergency Response Program.\n\nIt is the management's opinion that the Persigo WWTF emergency response program is in compliance with the OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plan Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38(a). These standards and the WWTF program are supported by the Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Grand Junction Haz-mat Team personnel. The Grand Junction Haz-mat Team has had specific on-site training at the WWTF to prepare for and respond to a release at this facility.\n\nAdditional points of contact:\nAny questions regarding the actions to be taken by the Haz-mat team, in the advent of a release at this facility, can be answered by, Mr. Drew Reekie, Environmental Specialist, of the Grand Junction Haz-mat team. Mr. Reekie can be reached by phone at (970) 244-1470, or his E-mail address is drewr@ci.grandjct.co.us.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nIt is the management's opinion that this facility is in compliance with all NFPA standards currently adopted and enforced by the Grand Junction Fire Department.
