Procedures are also evaluated and updated as required by the management of change system. Each covered chemical, including sulfur dioxide, has undergone an initial in-depth review to consider equipment, operations, and potential failures. These reviews, conducted at least every three years, are the center of any strong prevention program.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe International Paper Riegelwood Mill operates as a pulp and paper manufacturing facility.  This mill is located on approximately 1,200 acres in the eastern portion of Columbus County, North Carolina.  The areas immediately adjacent to the Riegelwood Mill are populated by residences and businesses, and areas along the river are used for transit and sport.  The International Paper facility is located immediately adjacent to the Cape Fear River and other smaller businesses and residences.  In addition, right-of-ways cross the mill providing access for the local power company, a water district, and railroad traffic.  \n\nThe International Paper facility receives raw wood materials that are processed, pulped and manufactured into various types of paper products. A number of chemicals are used to facilitate the processes and to support auxiliary mill operations.  The International Paper Riegelwood Mill operates three covered processes that are subject to EPA's RMP Rule, each with Program 3 reporting requirements.  \n\nThese processes include the use of:\n\nChlorine ? added to raw waters to condition process water prior to use in the pulp and paper production process.\nChlorine Dioxide ? added as a bleaching tool to provide the consumer desired \"whiteness\" of the final paper products.\nSulfur Dioxide ? used in the pulping process for pH control and to remove residual bleaching chemicals from the pulp product prior to use by the end consumer.\n\nIn compliance with EPA's RMP Rule, the International Paper Riegelwood Mill has developed and implemented a detailed Prevention Program.  This Prevention Program was originally formatted to meet the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard. The Prevention Program, in its existing form, has been in place and operational since 1995 but was built upon the mill's long standing commitment to safe chemical management.  The Riegelwood Mill's Prevention Program encompasses all 14 elements of a Prevention Program "

      "SummaryText": "as defined by both EPA and OSHA.  These 14 elements can be classified into three categories including: the technology of the covered processes (provides for the collection of information and development of tools to better understand the processes and chemicals used at the mill); facilities related to the covered processes (administers the systematic monitoring and upkeep of the processes); and the personnel involved in supporting the processes (facilitates the training of and communication with people responsible for the safety and operation of these processes.) \n\nAs an example of International Paper's commitment to a successful Prevention Program, the Riegelwood Mill has enhanced an existing Safe Works Practices Program.  This program represents an expanded version of a Hot Works Program that requires personnel to receive a permit prior to using spark generation equipment in potentially flammable or combustible environments.  International Paper's Safe Works Practices programs also includes provisions requiring preventive measures to be exercised prior to execution of other potentially risky or hazardous activities such as confined space entry or work occurring on energized equipment.\n\nInternational Paper's Riegelwood Mill has developed and implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Program that is detailed in the mill's Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was revised and expanded in response to the emergency planning requirement under OSHA's PSM Standard and has been in its existing format since 1995.  This ERP has been continually updated to reflect both policy and procedural changes related to emergency planning and response at the mill.  The ERP was most recently updated in early 1999 and meets the requirements of both EPA's RMP Rule and OSHA's PSM Standard.  The strength of the Riegelwood Mill's Emergency Response Program lies in the fact that International Paper supports and operates an on-site emergency response team 24 hours a da"

      "SummaryText": "y at the Riegelwood Mill.  Mill personnel are fully trained and equipped to respond to a release of hazardous chemicals.  The close proximity of these trained personnel and equipment to potential on-site releases at the mill allow for timely and efficient mitigation of releases.  In addition to the development and implementation of emergency response planning and training at the mill, International Paper has provided comprehensive information to and has participated in the preparation and coordination of emergency services with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThrough the continued implementation of the mill's Risk Management Program, International Paper strives to provide a safer workplace for its employees, to be a good neighbor, to protect the environment and its natural resources, and to comply with the provisions of the EPA's RMP Rule.  As the Riegelwood Mill continues to manufacture quality pulp and paper products, International Paper's corporate commitment to safety and the protection of the environment focuses on the continued improvement of our policies and procedures.  With this corporate focus, the Riegelwood Mill has implemented an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) process for bleaching pulp.  The ECF process replaces the chlorine gas used in the bleaching process with chlorine dioxide, a safer chemical.  The introduction of the ECF process has enabled International Paper to completely eliminate the use of chlorine railcars at the Riegelwood Mill.  International Paper stands committed to providing a safe workplace for its employees and to be a good corporate neighbor while continuing to provide quality pulp and paper products."
