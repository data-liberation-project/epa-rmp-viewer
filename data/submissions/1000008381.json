      "SummaryText": "Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies at POLYAIR - Bardstown, KY.  The facility has installed an isobutane and propane storage tanks and process equipment according to NFPA-58 and ASME standards.  The facility's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy and procedure to call the Nelson Co. Fire Department.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Discussion:\nThe facility stores isobutane in an 18,000 gallon above ground tank with a maximum fill of 14,400 gallons (80% capacity).  In addition, the facility has installed a second gas storage tank with a shell capacity of 10,000 gallons of propane (maximum fill 80%).  This new system mirrors the existing tank unloading system; delivery pumps and piping; and connection to the high pressure pumps in the pump and valve room.  Both materials are used as a blowing agent to produce expanded foam packing material.   Isobuatane and propane are extremely flammable and the facility has taken a number of steps to insure that the process is both maintained and operated in a safe manner.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario which is extremely unlikely would be a loss of 14,400 gallons of isobutane  or 8,000 gallons of propane due to the rupture of the tank or complete failure of the piping system connected to the tank during a use or unloading situation.  A vapor cloud explosion would have a predicted offsite impact of 1.0 psi overpressure at a maximum radius of 0.3 miles and could impact up to 170 people (as predicted from GIS mapping of 1990 census data).\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\nTwo alternatives considered were the loss of the liquid in the piping and two additional minutes for the automatic safety valves to shut the 3 systems normally closed solenoids.  The predicted loss of 100 pounds of isobutane and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion would have a 1.0 psi overpressure distance of 0.02 miles less than 200 feet.  This p"

      "SummaryText": "redicted impact would not affect any public receptor.\n\nOne alternative considered was the rupture of a loading hose do to a truck pull away. The release will be instantaneous, as the excess flow valves will stop the flow of material. The height of the release will be less than 1 meter.  The quantity of the release will be 100 lbs. of product, before the excess flow valves shut the process flow down.  Duration of the release will be seconds.  Release will be at atmospheric temperature and relative humidity.  This predicted impact would not affect any public receptor.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps:\nThe installation of this process line in 1996 and 2009 was according to NFPA 58 and ASME tank standards.  The storage tanks and piping are located inside a chain link fence security area.  Installation included the use of mechanical and electrical equipment specifically designed for liquefied natural gas service.  This system and components were reviewed by the Kentucky State Fire Marshall's office and all safety recommendations have been installed.  Numerous safety sensors have been installed in this process and include the following: 5 gas sensors that automatically shut down the process if gas is detected anywhere in the process or storage area; redundant mechanical and automatic shutoff that shutdown and isolate the system if there is any of the following conditions present: overpressure of the primary or secondary pumping lines, trigger of the automatic fire sprinkler system, loss of ventilation system in the isolated high pressure pump room; or mechanical shutdown initiated by any operator observing an unsafe process condition.\n\nAccident History:\nTo date (June 24, 2009) there have been no major releases of isobutane from this process since the process was started in 1996.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility's policy is to immediately call the Bardstown / Nelson County Fire Department and the Nelson County Local Emergency Pla"
