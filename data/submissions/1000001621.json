      "SummaryText": "Accidental release probability is minimized through training for employees in the safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide one ton containers and in the correct Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for connecting and disconnecting one ton containers from the process.\nThe Beaver Creek WWTP stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas in one ton containers used for disinfection of treated wastewater.  Beaver Creek WWTP has a maximum of 8,000 lbs chlorine and 6,000 lbs sulfurdioxide onsiite.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for Beaver Creek would result in a maximum threat zone for sulfur dioxide of 3.2 miles.  Based on the 2000 census, this release would affect a population of 21,000 from Beaver Creek.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide will affect a residential population of  14,000 from Beaver Creek within 2.6 miles.  The alternate release scenario for chlorine will affect a residential population of , 12,500 from Beaver Creek  Creek within 2.4 miles.\n\nThe WWT Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule, although Alabama is not an OSHA state.  The WWT Division conducts training for all operators in SOP, safe handling, and emergency response procedures.  All safety equipment is regularly inspected and calibrated.  Both training and inspections are documented.\n\nThe WWT Division has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas in the last five years.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, WWT plant personnel will notify the Dothan Fire Department by either radio or land line.  The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas.  \nThe City of Dothan HAZ-MAT Team conducts quarterly Emergency Response Drills.\n\nPerimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect the presences of unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\nThe WWT Division reviews SOP, conduct hazard analysis, and performs an audit every three years in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule."
