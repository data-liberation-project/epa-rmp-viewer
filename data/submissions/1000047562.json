      "SummaryText": "The Harvest Grand Chenier facility receives a mixture of natural gas and condensates from off-site wells. The gas is separated and piped to the adjacent Plains facility for Fractionation. The remaining condensates are processed through separators where water and light hydrocarbons are removed. The remaining condensate or oil is either stored in atmosphere storage tanks or pumped out via pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe worst case senario chosen was a loss of product in the transfer pipe going to Plains. The facility is required to comply to PSM/RMP due to the amount of product stored in the main transfer line if blocked in. Analyzing the release being 10,000 pounds of material lost, the radius of impact from an explosive cloud is 0.1 miles from the source.The chemical used that was on the RMP list was Methane being volital and representative to the product base.\n\n\n\nThe alternate case scenario is the same transfer pipe as located in the \"worst case\" except a one inch hole has been identified as being the case study. This release would impact a radius of 0.05 miles of an explosive cloud."
