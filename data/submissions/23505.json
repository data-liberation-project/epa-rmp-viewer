Box 79, Mendon, Mo.\nContact:     Valerie Gladback\nPhone:     660-272-3213\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n    AGRIServices of Brunswick,LLC, and the employees of the AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC in Mendon are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mendon Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. Propane is stored for use in heating and drying grain. The facility also handles pesticides, grain, feed and farm supply.\n\n    The facility has the capability to receive anhydrous ammonia via rail, thus, the maximum quanity stored and handled would be approximately 160,000 pounds in a 37,500 gallon railroad tank car. The maximum stored in our fixed 12,000 gallon storage tank would be 51,000 pounds. The propane is stored in one 18,000 gallon storage tank that would hold approximately 67,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the railroad tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.7 miles. The worst-case release scenario for the propane would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank in 10 minutes resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the endpoint (point of 1 psi overpressurization"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 23505,
      "SummaryText": ") would be 0.30 miles.\n\n    b. The alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be based on the most likely potential incident a release from a break in a 3? transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles. For propane the alternate release scenario would be a drive-away breaking a hose. Due to the shut-down systems employeed the only product lose would be from the hose itself or approximately 69 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of over-pressurization to 1 psi) would be 0.03 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the 1992 Edition of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 58.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergenc"
