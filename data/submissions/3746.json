If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\n\n\u0015\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for retail sale to farmers.\n\n\u0015\tAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\u0015\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 265,200 lbs in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n\u0015\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the contents of both storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes the maximum quantity released would be 265,200 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion) is 7.2 miles\n\n\u0015\tThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The estimated quantity released would be 400 pounds, The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion) is 0.1 mile.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\n\u0015\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
