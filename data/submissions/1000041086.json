IF AN \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO \n\nWORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER STATE AND LOCAL \n\nAUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT \n\nOF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

TYPICALLY, \n\nAMMONIA IS AT THE FACILITY 200 TO 325 DAYS OF THE YEAR. \n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF A RAIL CAR IS \n\nAPPROXIMATELY 135,000 POUNDS. A PLANT EMPLOYEE, TRAINED IN THE \n\nOPERATION OF UNLOADING AND HANDLING AMMONIA, IS IN \n\nATTENDANCE DURING THE TIME THE CAR IS HOOKED UNTIL THE TIME \n\nUNLOADING IS SUSPENDED AND THE CAR IS DISCONNECTED AND \n\nSECURED FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY.\n\n     \n\n III.
