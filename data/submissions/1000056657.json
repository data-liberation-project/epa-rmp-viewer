The site has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and IVXP will continue to implement the site policies to keep the site safe and environmental friendly.  This commitment will continue to be demonstrated by investing in resources for accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  The facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on site and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Indorama Ventures Xylenes & PTA LLC (IVXP) - Alabama Plant is located at 1401 Finley Island Road, Decatur, Alabama 35601.  The facility is owned by Indorama Ventures Public Company Limited.   The site manufactures paraxylene, purified terephthalic acid, and dimethyl 2,6-napthalene dicarboxylate.  In these processes, the site uses four covered flammable chemicals and no toxic chemicals in sufficient quantities to be listed. The four flammables include Ethylene, Propane, 1-3, Butadiene and Hydrogen.  Three of the site's processes are covered under the RMP regulation. \n\n\n\nThe Alabama Plant is subject to the Clean Air Act Title V permitting regulation and operates under permit ID: 712-0002.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nFollowing is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at IVXP.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan.  In addition, the facility has teams that address process safety and employee safety issues and that promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the site, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management.  Some of these teams are the Site Process Safety Committee, Site Behavior Based Safety Committee, and Contractor Safety Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nIVXP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Operating areas within the site are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

The site assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\n\n\nThe site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and site changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nIVXP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nIVXP exclusively uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The site has conducted HAZOP studies since 1988.\n\n\n\nThe site also conducts Layer for Protection Analysis (LOPA) Studies in conjunction with"

The LOPA provides specific criteria and restrictions for evaluation of independent protection layers, reducing the subjectivity of qualitative methods. \n\n\n\nThe PHA/LOPA team findings are reviewed by management for endorsement of the action plans.  A written action plan is generated by management assigning responsibility and determining an expected completion date for each recommendation made during the study.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to team findings are tracked in an electronic database until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, IVXP periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nIVXP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are written and updated based on a document control process and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

Entry-level standards have been set for new operator.  In addition, new operators receive basic training in site operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is placed on shift with experienced personnel to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge and skills to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nIVXP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for containment systems).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  IVXP incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nIVXP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  Process supervision uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, IVXP periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to site management for resolution.

One of those is a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work). Procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nIVXP has a hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a covered process.  IVXP has a procedure that addresses the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and there is a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed. Employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure and Hot Work Permit Forms are audited to ensure than any errors in preparation or approval are identified and brought to the attention of those involved to prevent recurrence. \n\n\n\n Contractors \n\n\n\nIVXP uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their work place,"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, IVXP has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to site processes or other site facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives from IVXP attend periodic meetings of the Morgan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.

However, a third party supplier, Air Products, of Hydrogen is located on the site and their storage facility, which is not owned or operated by IVXP,  is subject to PSM and RMP requirements and standards.  IVXP interconnected Hydrogen systems have been included in this submittal as well.  IVXP has requested the required information from the third party company for this submittal.\n\n\n\nAir Products -Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we store hydrogen, and provide hydrogen to the customer, IVXP. Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility, and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit, if applicable, so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared "

The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\nAir Products -The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage of hydrogen and the transfer via pipeline to IVXP. The hydrogen is delivered into the hydrogen storage tank as a cryogenic liquid.  The product is stored as a liquid in the double-walled, vacuum insulated tank, similar in design to a thermos bottle. The minimum tank pressure is determined by the setting of the pressure building regulator, which allows liquid to be vaporized into a gas in the pressure building coil, and then returned to re pressurize the tank. The maximum tank pressure in normal operation is determined by the setting of the economizer regulator, which opens whenever the tank builds pressure, thereby allowing the excess boiloff gas in the tank to flow into the withdrawal line to the customer. The normal design conditions, however, are for liquid to flow to the vaporizer, where it is converted to a gas by absorbing heat, most commonly from the ambient air. The gas flows to the control manifold where it is regulated to the desired pressure by means of a self-acting, spring-loaded regulator, and then finally enters the customer's supply line. This manifold also contains a self-actuating temperature control valve which is set to close if the gas temperature falls to -20?F to -40?F. This valve will automatically re-open when the temperature rises above the setpoint, and it is designed to fail closed. This manifold also includes a check valve to prevent reverse flow, pressure indicator and purge valve, shut off valves, and a bypass line around the regulator and check valve for maintenance purposes.\n\n\n\nAir Products -The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention ste"
