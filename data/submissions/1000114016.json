Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement plans, which fall into three primary areas:\n\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis: Identification of potential hazards, and prompt implementation of corrective action are done in accordance with applicable regulations and as a matter of company policy.\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation: Prompt, thorough investigation of all significant incidents and near-misses are conducted and findings are shared across the company.\n\u00bf\tBenchmarking: The facility continually evaluates its safety program and processes against the best in the world, with the goal of continual improvement.\n\nThe plant has received recognition by OSHA under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), including its process safety programs. As part of ongoing efforts to improve safety at the facility, several RMP regulated chemicals at the facility have been removed or substituted for safer chemicals. As a result of this, the number of RMP covered chemicals in use at the facility has decreased from five to two."

The status of audit recommendations is tracked until resolution.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\tEPA requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impact be reported in the EPA RMP submittal document. Within the last five years, since July 26, 2019, there were no releases of hazardous materials that met the criteria for an RMP accident.\n\t \n6.

As appropriate, the police, local hospitals, and other coordinating agencies also continue to be involved in emergency response for the facility.  \n\t\n\tThe plant manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.

A permit system is in place, which requires that contractors obtain written approval to begin a work task. The Houston Nouryon plant requires its contractors to complete safety training conducted by the Houston Area Safety Council.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\nThe facility conducts a PSSR before new or modified processes are started up, to verify sure that the new or modified facilities and the associated procedures are safe for operation.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThe facility has an ongoing system to test, inspect and maintain the process equipment in good working order, as needed for safe operation.  New equipment and installations are inspected before first use (PSSR) to ensure that they were constructed properly and are safe to operate. Mechanical integrity program test, inspection and repair priorities are established around equipment identified as safety critical.\n\nSafe Work Practices:\nThe facility has permit systems in place to make sure that hazardous activities such as hot work, confined space entry, and energy isolation are performed safely, by requiring that knowledgeable persons from operations and maintenance provide written permission before such work can be performed.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThe facility has procedures in place to identify safety and health impacts of a change to procedures and equipment.

Knowledgeable operators write or review operating procedures and are included in process hazard analyses. Employees attend monthly safety meetings that begin with a safety topic to increase safety awareness and employee involvement. Operators are assigned to project teams to review and comment on new designs, to train on new processes and to train others on major process changes prior to implementation.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nThe facility maintains updated information regarding its chemical hazards, processes, procedures, and equipment, which is used by employees as needed to help them do their jobs safely.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nNew and existing processes, and any changes to existing processes, are examined using OSHA PSM recognized process hazard analysis (PHA).

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if a release does occur, trained Nouryon personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident. Details on the emergency response program are outlined in Section 6.\n\t\nIn the event of a significant accidental release, Nouryon personnel will respond by shutting down operations, and/or by applying water mitigation to absorb and dilute the release of water-soluble chemicals. As necessary, onsite personnel will be evacuated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department and police will be notified to help handle the emergency and warn the public. Additionally, the facility has an automated system in place to contact potentially affected members of the community by telephone to provide communication of a potential chemical hazard.\n\n4.  Prevention Program\nThe Nouryon Houston facility is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has contributed to process safety.  The facility has had no RMP chemical release accidents over the last five years.

The facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nThe hazards of the process operated at the Nouryon Houston facility are managed through safety programs developed at the facility. For ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO), numerous process controls such as sensors, alarms and interlocks detect and prevent hazardous upset conditions. Automatic shut-off valves prevent EO/PO from being added unless the process conditions are safe. Leak sensors provide alarms if leaks are detected and deluge systems are provided for tank, unloading, and reactor areas to absorb leaks. Dikes are provided for the storage tanks. All of the vessels are protected with self-closing relief valves, and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere. The EO/PO suppliers have well developed product stewardship programs and periodically visit the facility to provide assistance in the safe handling of oxides and special training materials towards that goal.\n\nSeveral regulated chemicals-sulfur dioxide, isopropylamine and ammonia-were discontinued at the facility in a effort to make the process inherently safer by utilizing alternate process chemistry. \n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards adopted by Nouryon.
