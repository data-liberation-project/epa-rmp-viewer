If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Sturbridge Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a glass working industry used to fabricate communication grade fiber optics for Local Area Networks (LANS), Municipal Area Networks (MANS), and Wide Area Networks (WANS).  Our products find their way into computers, telephone networks, and telescopes.  SpecTran Corporation develops, manufactures and markets glass optical fibers and value-added fiber optic products.  For global communications markets, SpecTran manufactures standard fiber and cable as well as special performance fiber and cable.  The company's application specific optical fiber and cable products also serve industrial, aerospace and medical markets worldwide.  We have licensing agreements with Lucent Technologies, Inc. and plan to supply the growing internet expansion.  For additional information about SpecTran, visit the company's web site at www.spectran.com.  We use Propane for winter heating and this is stored in a 30,000 gallon tank bermed with stone per the request of the Sturbridge Fire Chief.  The propane is used to fire two 6,000,000 Btu per hour boilers, several smaller roof top units, as well as three vaporizers.  We also use Hydrogen on site with liquid storage in two, 18,000 gallon tanks.  The liquid hydrogen is vaporized using ambient air temperature heat exchangers which supplys manufacturing lathes with gaseous hydrogen.  The hydrogen is a premium fuel used in making high temperature glass for optical clarity.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario. -- Our worst-case scenario is failure of our 30,000 ga"

According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to endpoint is 0.40 miles.  The estimated population affected by the 1 psi over-pressure by the US Census Bureau using a Block Group Proration method is 31 people.  A similar  failure scenario for Hydrogen for our two 18,000 gallon tanks filled to the greatest amount allowed would be again a vapor cloud explosion.  Per the EPA supplied RMPCOMP program, the estimated endpoint distance is 0.30 miles.  The estimated population affected, again using the US Census Bureau Block Group Proration Method would be 18 people.  After saying this, one needs to reconize that the likelyhood of such an event is highly unlikely.  Our Propane tank is stationary and covered in stone.  The Hydrogen tanks have two tank construction -- a vacuum tank covering a thick walled stainless steel tank.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario. -- Our alternative-case scenario, which represents a more likely scenario is represented by fill line failure resulting in a 10 minute accumulation of unburned gases of the spilled contents such as found in tank filling operations.  For Propane filling operations the resulting failure could result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp program, the distance to endpoint would be 0.06 miles for 1 psi overpressure.  For Hydrogen filling operations the resulting failure could yield a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint distance of 0.10 miles.   The estimated population affected, again using the US Census Bureau Block Group Proration Method for Hydrogen would be 2 people, for Propane the number of people affected would be 1 person.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.
