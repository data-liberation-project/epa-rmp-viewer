The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAmerican Pacific Corporation Utah Operations (AMPAC) is dedicated to preventing chemical emergencies.  AMPAC has several divisions in its Utah operations.  The divisions are contiguously located on AMPAC property.  The facility handles anhydrous ammonia and propane, both of which are considered hazardous by EPA.  AMPAC's WECCO division manufactures oxidizers and AMPAC's American Azide division manufactures sodium azide.  Anhydrous ammonia is an essential ingredient in ammonium perchlorate.  Anhydrous ammonia is a key ingredient in sodium azide.  Ammonium perchlorate is a critical component for the defense of our country and is an important ingredient in space program for both manned and unmanned vehicles.  Sodium azide is the prime agent in many air bags that supplies the nitrogen to inflate the air bags and save lives.  Ammonia is a toxic substance that is widely used in households in limited concentrations.  Propane is used at AMPAC to provide building heat and to generate steam.  Steam is a necessary element in our process providing heat to be able to form the products that we make, preventing winter freezing of process lines and systems and heating most of our buildings.  Propane is a flammable substance.  The very properties that make it hazardous are the same properties that make it valuable.  For both ammonia and propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our coworkers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  At AMPAC, it is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane combined with the safety devices designed into the systems.  Our procedures for handling the materials and the training that we have provided to our employees reduce the"

AMPAC administratively limits the fill ratio of the ammonia tanks to 80% in the perchlorate process, the fill ratio of ammonia tanks in the sodium amide process to 85%,  and the fill ratio of the propane tanks to 86.667%, all in accordance with good safety practices for the vessels.  AMPAC Senior management has devoted many resources to training our employees to be capable of responding to any situations that could be hazardous and believes the response training is also integral in preventing incidents.  An AMPAC manager has been supported in acting as a member of the Iron County local Emergency Planning Committee.  AMPAC has also provided training to local and state responders to increase their familiarity with our materials and increase public safety in the event that an emergency occurs with any of the products we produce even if they were manufactured by a competitor.  The AMPAC facility was intentionally constructed away from town to minimize any effects if an incident did occur.  AMPAC believes the public recognizes its commitment to be a good citizen of the community based on its community involvement and its care in the design and operation of the plant to protect the community.\n\n2. The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\nAMPAC has two EPA Risk Management Plan regulated substances on site.  These are anhydrous ammonia and propane.\n\nAMPAC has two anhydrous ammonia tanks at the WECCO division, which can contain 82,400 pounds of ammonia each.  Ammonia can be received by truck but is normally received by rail.  A rail car may contain up to 180,000 pounds of ammonia.  The ammonia is used in three ammonium chloride reactors.

In addition, three individual building tanks can contain 3,645 pounds of propane each.  These tanks are used to supply building heat.  While it is possible to receive propane by rail car, no propane has been received by rail in over five years therefore a railcar has not been included as a potential on site source for offsite consequence analysis.  If railcars are used in the future, AMPAC will modify its RMP plan accordingly and submit a revision to EPA.  Propane at AMPAC is received by truck.  Propane at the facility is transported from storage to use points (boilers or building heaters) by pipeline.\n\n\n3. Facility description, Worst Case Release Scenarios, and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nAMPAC is a facility that manufactures specialty oxidizers in its WECCO division facility.

Some of our customers use sodium perchlorate directly either in solution or dry form.   Sodium perchlorate is used for everything from electro-machining to adding other materials to it to form a slurry explosive.

Sodium azide is primarily used in automotive air bags however it also has essential uses in pharmaceutical manufacture.  Sodium azide has also been used as a blood pressure controlling medication.\n\nThe facility process starts with the reaction of anhydrous ammonia with sodium metal to form sodium amide.  The sodium amide is then reacted with nitrous oxide to form sodium azide and sodium hydroxide.  There is ammonia present in the sodium azide reactors.  All excess ammonia that can not be recycled to the process is scrubbed with water.  The resultant water solution is excellent fertilizer and is used at AMPAC Farms.

EPA has provided a set of guidance tables to conduct offsite consequence analysis.  These tables have been used to develop software publicly available over the internet that is known as RMP*Comp Ver. 1.06.  This software (available from the EPA website) was used to determine the consequence analysis.  The scenario required to be used was the rupture of an incoming supply rail car of anhydrous ammonia.  Suppliers limit the fill ratio of ammonia cars in the size we purchase to 73 metric tons or 160,936  pounds.  AMPAC does not control maintenance on the railcar but has carefully selected its suppliers to obtain a high quality feedstock from manufacturers who care about the quality of their products and the containers in which they ship.  The suppliers must also meet Department of Transportation requirements to ship the ammonia over the rail lines.  These facts make the selected worst case scenario unlikely.

RMP*Comp Version 1.06 was used to calculate the results of the consequence analysis.\n\nChemical: Propane\nCAS #: 74-98-6\nCategory: Flammable Gas\nScenario: Alternative\nLiquefied under pressure\nRelease Type: Vapor Cloud Fire\nStorage Parameters: Release from Pipe\nInitial Operational Flow Rate: 35 pounds per min\nCross-sectional area of pipe: 2.953 square inches\nOperational pipe pressure: 195 psi\nChange in pipe elevation: 3 feet\n\nRelease Rate: 964 pounds per min\nMitigation Measures: Active Mitigation to Reduce Release Rate by factor of 0.9\n\nTopography: Rural surroundings (terrain generally flat and unobstructed)\nLower Flammability Limit: 36 mg/L\nEstimated Distance to Lower Flammability Limit: <0.1 miles (<0.16 kilometers)\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAMPAC is regulated under OSHA's PSM standard for ammonia and EPA's regulations on risk management programs, which requires a 14 point program be present to prevent accidents.  The quantity of Propane on site triggers exactly the same requirements for propane through the EPA Regulations on risk management plans although propane is not covered under OSHA's PSM standard when used to provide heat.  AMPAC has a maintenance program that generates preventive maintenance work orders routinely through a compu"

AMPAC has written operating procedures which meet ISO 9001 requirements for a quality system and are audited by outside auditors on a regular schedule.  These items all serve to minimize the risk of an accidental release.  AMPAC has additionally trained its response team so that a well trained team is present 24 hours per day, 7 days a week to respond to any emergency in a timely and appropriate fashion.  The emergency response program specifically covers ammonia and propane as well as other materials on site not regulated by EPA under the risk management program.\n\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\nAMPAC has had no releases of propane from the steam production process or ammonia from either of the ammonia using processes that threatened on site or off site personnel.  No injuries have occurred from either material.  No evacuations have occurred as a result of either material and no property damage has occurred as a result of either ammonia or propane.  AMPAC does have an incident investigation program.  AMPAC does take corrective actions even for minor incidents that do not trigger recording under this program.  AMPAC continues to develop its safety programs through both new technologies and learning from any experiences no matter how minor.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nAs previously mentioned, AMPAC has a well-trained emergency response organization.  AMPAC has written response procedures on which the team has been trained and the procedures are provided to the Iron County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for coordination.  The response team has periodic drills, which vary from responding to fires and evacuating on site personnel to responding to spills.  AMPAC has trained local outside response personnel such as the fire department and high way patrol.  AMPAC has served as the site for community drill involving a simulated acid spill in the past and will make itself available for"

AMPAC has had a clear history of immediately notifying outside responders in the past (these responses have involved items not regulated under the risk management regulations).  AMPAC has worked side by side with outside responders to provide any information that they may require in preparing their responses to any AMPAC incident.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAMPAC will add new valves that can be more remotely controlled and that act to create a shutdown if excessive temperatures occur at the ammonia or propane tanks.  The valves should be installed by August 31, 1999 and were identified during an April 1999 audit as candidates for improvement.  Maintenance will occur to replace relief valves on the tanks on periodic schedules with an upcoming replacement scheduled to occur by August 31, 1999."
