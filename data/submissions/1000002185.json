Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Solvay Fluorides, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement  controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC primary activities encompass the manufacture, processing and sales of chemicals for industrial uses.  Our products have many applications.  They are used in fluoridated drinking water, specialty metals, such as titanium, computer chips and printed circuit boards, refrigerant for air conditioners, stain-resistant fiber coating, non-stick cookware, wood preservatives, stainless steel, petroleum alkylation and pharmaceuticals.\n\nWe have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid, anhydrous Ammonia and aqueous Ammonia.  Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid is used for the source of fluoride ion in each of the nine products manufactured at our Alorton plant.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for the manufacture of technical grade and semiconductor grade ammonium fluoride.  Aqueous Ammonia (aqueous) is used for the capture of the fluoride ion in our fume scrubbers.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThis facility has developed worst case and alternative scenarios in accordance with 40 CFR 68.
