As part of this commitment, Reichhold has established a Risk Management Program that helps the company to identify and communicate risks associated with our operations and reasonable controls have been established to prevent accidental releases from occurring. In the unlikely event of a release of hazardous materials from the facility, specific plans are in place to reduce the effects upon our employees and the general public. Reichhold has developed site-specific plans for emergency response that involve both our employees and local emergency service providers. These plans are in compliance with the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) plan requirements and follow the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by the U.S. EPA (EPA form 8700-25).\n\n\n\nPROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\n\n\nReichhold's Valley Park facility uses Toluene Di-Isocyanate, commonly referred to as TDI, to produce a variety of urethane coatings and other resins. TDI onsite in quantities in excess of the applicability threshold is subject to the RMP regulations. In addition to TDI, Reichhold uses several other chemicals not subject to the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nPhysical security of the plant is maintained by a chain link fence topped by barbed wire that encompasses the site. Site activities are monitored by sixteen TV cameras, with monitor screens located in the Guard House and other plant computers. A Security Guard is on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, Reichhold has conducted an assessment of the off-site consequences of the worst-case and alternative releases. The worst-case release is defined as the sudden release of the entire contents of the single vessel contain"

The alternative release relates to a scenario that is more likely than the worst case and which occurs during typical meteorological conditions.  Changes to the Risk Management Plan requirements, promulgated by EPA in April 2004, prohibit inclusion of off-site consequence information in the Executive Summary portion of the Risk Management Plan. Information pertaining to this assessment is included in the RMP data elements.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nReichhold is dedicated to continuous improvement of its comprehensive Environmental, Health and Safety (\"EH&S\") Program, which includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). Employees are highly trained, knowledgeable, and skilled, which results in a workforce that is very capable in their job performance. Employees are supplied with detailed information concerning their job duties, chemicals on site, and operating the processes. The OSHA Process Safety Management Program is used to identify, correct, review, and mitigate potential hazards associated with chemical processes.  Employee participation in the development and implementation of these programs is essential to ensure employee understanding and compliance with each element of the programs.\n\n\n\nReichhold has developed a strong Contractor Safety and Management Program. Contractors and their employees are treated as though they are Reichhold employees, while performing work at the Valley Park facility. Contractors are trained on Reichhold processes and procedures, expected to participate, as necessary, in incident investigations, and are held to the same standards of performance as Reichhold employees.\n\n\n\nFinally, in an effort to continually improve these programs, regular audits are performed to determine the facility's implementation and operation under these programs. The audits are use"

Audits also help to ensure compliance with the intent and requirements of Reichhold's EH&S Program.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAll incidents and near misses with the potential to cause any injury or damages are investigated with a team of experienced personnel.  Reports are developed for all TDI incidents. Reports include, at a minimum, injuries, fatalities, personnel evaluated, and included in shelter in place, impact on the environment, emergency response actions, and cause(s). The regulations require the reporting of RMP events involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site or other off-site consequences. There have been no releases in the past five years that require reporting under the RMP Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an accurate list of all TDI near misses and incidents. This is used during revisions to the plant Emergency Response Plan, employee training, Process Hazard Analyses (\"PHAs\"), and procedures. When there is a RMP accident, the facility notifies regulatory agencies. The facility will also plan and hold a public meeting within 90 days following the RMP accident. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nReichhold has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (\"ERP\") that is coordinated with St. Louis County Emergency Management and Valley Park Fire Department. The ERP provides clear roles and responsibilities, procedures, and corrective measures to be used in the event of an emergency that could threaten human health or the environment.  Along with emergency response procedures, the plan includes preparedness and prevention, notification, and post-emergency recovery procedures designed to minimize injuries to personnel and damage to property in the event of a fire, explosion, haza"

The facility shares their ERP with local agencies, medical facilities, and emergency response personnel. Furthermore, the facility works with the city, fire department, and Local Emergency Planning Committee (\"LEPC\") to ensure their emergency response plans include response information for the Reichhold Valley Park facility. \n\n\n\nReichhold will respond positively to requests for information from outside agencies and the public.  Facility tours are provided for first responders, the Valley Park Fire Department, emergency medical/ambulance service, and the St. Louis County Police Department.\n\n\n\nTransportation of hazardous materials within the local area is included in planning activities.  The ERP considers chemical distribution safety and emergency response capabilities of local agencies by utilizing CHEMTREC, state, and local networks.\n\n\n\nEmployees are trained and familiar with the contents of the plan and their roles and responsibilities as specified in the plan. The facility is planning to perform drills involving the LEPC, fire department, and the city of Valley Park. These drills can include field exercises or tabletop exercises. The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and updated, as needed. The ERP is also revised based on deficiencies from drills or incidents. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nReichhold works with employees, vendors, and Corporate EH&S support staff and incorporates corrective actions identified through programs, such as mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigation, and PHA studies to continually improve the safety of processes. Reichhold will continue to evaluate and document analyses of safer technologies.\n\n"
