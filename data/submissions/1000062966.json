Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nIt is the intent of CS Beef Packers to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  CS Beef will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\r\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  CS Beef takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\nThe PSM Coordinator and Maintenance Engineer are responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\r\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nCS Beef Packers produces will produce a range of edible beef products and inedible beef byproducts.  The facility will operate an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 38,000 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the plant.\r\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.
