      "SummaryText": "EPA Facilty ID 1000 0008 6104\n\nFounded in January 1967, Balchem supplies the animal nutrition market with specialty products derived from our encapsulation and chelation technologies, in addition to basic choline chloride.  Balchem is also one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of choline chloride, an essential nutrient for animal health, predominantly in the poultry and swine industries. Choline plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat and the building and maintaining of cell structures. Choline deficiency can result in, among other symptoms, reduced growth and perosis in chicks, fatty liver, kidney necrosis and general poor condition in baby pigs.\n\nAt the Saint Gabriel plant, regulated substances ethylene oxide and trimethylamine are used to produce the non-hazardous aqueous choline chloride product.  There have been no accidental releases in at least the last five years.   Accidental release prevention is accomplished through the RMP / PSM elements with emphasis on Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity and Employee Training.  The production process is designed to go to a safe mode in the event of power loss or other disruption.  The site is always occupied with production areas monitored with cameras, chemical sensors, and fire detection.\n\nShould a chemical leak occur, water deluge can be applied and a contract emergency response team is available to respond as described in the site\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan.  To improve future safety, the site will install pressure relief for the EO feed line during extended power outage as identified in the last PHA.  Improvements are also planned for perimeter security, and management systems are being improved to track compliance due dates and preventative maintenance requirements."
