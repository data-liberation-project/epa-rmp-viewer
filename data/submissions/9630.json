      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of Blanchard Valley Farmers Cooperative, Inc., East Findlay Agronomy Branch, to prevent an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by maintaining the equipment and training the employees in the proper procedures in the storage and handling of the material.  In the case of an emergency we would rely on the Washington Township Fire Department to control the situation.  The stationary source is one storage tank containing a maximum of 130,000 pounds of product.  The worst-case scenario would be a total loss of the contents of the tank.  The alternative release scenario would be a loss occuring when a transfer hose fails.  There are no administrative controls which can limit the distance of the potential material release.  The mitigation measures that limit the distance of the potential material release is the excess flow valve.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are to adhere to the normal operation procedures for using an ammonia fertilizer tank.  The five-year accident history is void of any releases from the storage tank.  The emergency response program in case of an ammonia leak is as follows:  1) Evacuate all non-essential personnel to the maintenance building; 2) Notify management; 3) Determine size of leak; if a small leak (less than 100 pounds), a) use proper PPE; b) stop flow of gas, if possible; c) allow liquid to vaporize or absorb with water - if a large leak (100 pounds or more), a) notify fire department and b) use proper PPE; 4) Notify Hancock LEPC, National Response Center, Ohio EPA, Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources, Ohio Dept. of Agriculture, CHEMTREC, and Norfolk & Southern railroad; 5) Notify Risk Coordinator.  There are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
