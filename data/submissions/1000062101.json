Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe SNF Holding Company facility in Riceboro, Georgia (SNF) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property, and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities include the manufacture of water treatment polymers and related polymers.  We have four regulated toxic substances above the RMP threshold quantity at our facility: acrylonitrile, ammonium hydroxide solution (30 percent), formaldehyde solution (50 percent), and methyl chloride.  Acrylonitrile is used as a feedstock in the manufacture of acrylamide.  The maximum amount of acrylonitrile stored on-site is 4,200,000 pounds.  Ammonium hydroxide is received and stored at the facility as a 30 percent solution.  It is used in the production of polyacrylamide and polyacrylamide emulsions.  The maximum amount of ammonium hydroxide 30 percent solution stored on-site is 190,000 pounds (56,000 pounds pure (100 percent basis) ammonia).  Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in the NMA process.  It is received and stored as a 50 percent solution.  The maximum amount of formaldehyde 50 percent solution stored on-site is 100,000 pounds (51,000 pounds pure (100 percent basis) formaldehyde).  Methyl chloride is used as a raw material in the chloromethylation process.  The maximum quantity of methyl chloride stored on-site is 1,800,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.

In addition, the facility has implemented programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention and process safety management programs that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\n\n\nSNF maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with its covered processes. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and environmental, health and safety, and will be revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures that address various modes of operation.  The information is reviewed annually and is accessible to workers involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nSNF has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nSNF will carry out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemica"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training, if necessary, to address the modification prior to working with the modified process.  In addition, operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regulated practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nSNF promptly investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the event from reoccurring. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWe believe that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees will participate in the elements of PSM and RMP.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nSNF may use contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. SNF has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential process hazards related to the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of emergency response duties in the event of a release or incident.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, the SNF facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated material from a covered process that resulted in a death, injury, or sig"

Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nSNF has a written emergency response plan to address accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan covers aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, and the public.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect pertinent changes occurring within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The plan is coordinated with the Liberty County Sheriff's office and Fire Department, Liberty-Hinesville Emergency Management Agency, Life Star Rescue Helicopter, Liberty Memorial Medical Center, and Memorial Medical Center in Savannah.  In addition, the facility has a system that will automatically notify the community of emergencies that require emergency response actions such as evacuations or shelter-in-place.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the elements of the Prevention Program (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Operating Procedure Reviews, etc.), Polychemie routinely evaluates the safety of its processes and implements changes as appropriate which in turn improve process safety.\n\n"
