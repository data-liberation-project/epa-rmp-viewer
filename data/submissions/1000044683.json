This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that facility management invests in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cytec Carbon Fibers LLC plant is located at 7139 Augusta Road, Greenville, South Carolina.  The plant is owned by Cytec Industries, Inc.  Various chemicals are processed to produce carbon fibers for use in the aerospace industry.  For example, carbon fiber is a strong, light-weight material that when used to replace metal in aircraft results in reduced fuel usage while maintaining a secure, safe structure.  \n\nThe regulated substance at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity is acrylonitrile.  Acrylonitrile is stored in an atmospheric tank and is charged to low pressure, low temperature reactors where it is converted to acrylic polymer suitable for spinning and converting to carbon fiber.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the preven"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  \n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  \n\nIn addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personnel safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personnel safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  One initiative is the Safe Attitudes From Empowerment (S.A.F.E.) Process, which is a behavior based safety system, in which employees participate in developing safe work habits.  The S.A.F.E. Process is designed to allow employees to identify at-risk behaviors in the workplace and develop corrective actions prior to incident, injury, and illness.  Successful implementation of the S.A.F.E. Process encourages frequent discussions on safe behaviors and improvements  \n\nAlso, each work group participates in monthly safety meetings.  Members from a work group are responsible for determining the topics and then presenting the information to their co-workers.  Topics range from safety issues off-the-job to safety issues in the workplace.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, a"

There is documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  \n\n\n\nFor process areas the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant uses a variety of PHA analysis techniques to"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with management for approval.  All approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: \n\n(1) unit startup, \n\n(2) normal operations, \n\n(3) temporary operations, \n\n(4) emergency shutdown, \n\n(5) normal shutdown,\n\n(6) initial startup of a new process, and\n\n(7) troubleshooting  \n\n\n\nThese procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

Examples of these include (1) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (3) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \n\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Any changes to chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated and documented.  \n\nIn addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nThe investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\nBoth hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Greenville Cytec Carbon Fibers plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the Program 3 EPA RMP covered process at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Greenville plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in our processes:  \n\nRelease Detection:\n\n1. Acrylonitrile detectors set at the OSHA PEL with alarms\n\n2. Acrylonitrile reli"

The results from the worst-case hazard assessment indicate the impact radius to the ERPG-2 concentration of 76 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) for AN is 4.1 miles from the AN storage tank.  Please note that at the time this hazard assessment was completed, the tank was not yet in operation.  Consistent with EPA requirements, the RMP worst-case off-site consequence analysis will be updated to this scenario within 6 months after start of operation of the AN storage tank.\n\n\n\nGP3 Polymerization Building (B-52): The GP3 Polymerization Building will have several vessels containing AN.  For purposes of the hazard assessment, Cytec used RMPComp modeling software and assumed complete failure of the 2,000 gallon AN charge tank into the B-52 containment sump which will be completely covered with the exception of a 6 inch horizontal vent at an elevation of 22 feet above grade.  Since the sump is completely covered with the vent, Cytec used the evaporation rate determined from RMPComp and a mitigation factor of 30 percent in accordance with the guidance provided in United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 550 B 99 009, March 2009, Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis to determine the total release rate from the sump.  Cytec assumed 50 percent of the release is vented through the horizontal vent pipe and 50 percent is vented through sump cover which is not completely air tight and there will be an opening where trench drains tie in to the sump.  USEPA SCREEN3 air dispersion modeling software was used to determine the 1 hour concentration of AN at the nearest property boundary to the sump.   The results from the worst-case hazard assessment indicates the impact radius to the ERPG 2 concentration of 76 mg/m3 for AN is 0.28 miles.   Cytec was able to determine that"
