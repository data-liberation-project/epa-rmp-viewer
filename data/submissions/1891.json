The overpressurization endpoint would be .5 miles.  Strict guidelines are specified, such as no safety nor preventative measures or emergency response means may be considered to mitigate event.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\nMore credible model would be loss of contents of an 8000 gallon tanktruck of BD.  Overpressurization endpoint would be .12 miles.  Safety and preventative measures can be considered and model must have an off-site impact.\n\nWe prevent chemical releases at Mallard Creek by...\nDesigning for Safety\nTaking care of our Equipment\nMaintaining Safe Operations\nOperating Safely\nMaintaining Emergency Response Capability \n\nDesigning for Safety\n\nBackup safety systems and interlocks are part of our design\nPiping and vessels are designed according to strict engineering standards and codes\nBD storage tanks are surrounded by a dike which would contain the entire contents of the largest ta"

Many plant personnel have received Operational and Technician Level Hazmat training as well as incipient stage fire brigade training from Texas A & M University.\nIn plant emergency response drills are performed regularly with modern, up-to-date equipment"
