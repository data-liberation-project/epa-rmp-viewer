Currently, there are no manufacturing operations taking place, as equipment is being installed and tested.  Future changes to RMP are anticipated upon start-up of operations during early November 2003.\n\n     The regulatory stationary source is considered to be the entire Rosina facility located at 75 Empire Drive, in West Seneca, New York.  The stationary source will be involved in the manufacture of pasta products.  Ammonia liquified under pressure is the only regulated chemical exceeding a threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n     Rosina proactively used the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119, in conjunction with the additional off-site considerations addressed in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an acidental ammonia release prevention program.  These documents are considered as working documents by Rosina Management, and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases of ammonia.  There have been no reportable accidents at the Rosina facility over the past five years, given it is newly acquired facility.\n\n     Emergency response policies for the Rosina facility include an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\", 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right-to Know\", 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management\", and 40 CFR Part 68 \"Ris Management Program\".  The integration of the programs for the Rosina facility increases the usefullness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  In general, Rosina performs mior emergency response measures with properly trained in-house personnel, however, local emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies.  Community notification policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.  An intergral aspect of the em"

      "SummaryText": "ergency response program is the continual corporate emphasis placed on proper employee training.\n\n     The worst case scenario release involves a complete release from the largest vessel of the refrigeration system.  This include a release of 2,825 pounds a ammonia over a ten minute period.  The endpoint distance of 0.7 miles was calculated using Exhibit 4-4 in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office's document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammina Refrigeration\" (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n     The alternative release scenario involves the venting of one of several relief valves from the facility's ammonia refrigeration system.  The office of the relief valve is 0.5 inches in diameter and the release occurs at a pressure of 180 psi, resulting in a release of 540 pounds of ammonia gas per minute (total of 5,400 pounds).  Reffering to Exhibit 4-6 in the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (40 CFR Part 68), an endpoint distance of 0.20 miles results.\n\n     The accidental release prevention program integrates the OSHA Process Safety Management required under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the additonal off-site considerations addresed in the 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart D, as an accidental release prevention program.
