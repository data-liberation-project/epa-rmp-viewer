      "SummaryText": "The Facility maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which sustain a milk and nut cooler, a -10 degree F freezer unit, plant process water coolers, and Facility air conditioners.\n\nPlant Descripton:  The Plant is located in Abilene, Kansas, on the south side of Interstate Highway 70, at 1993 Caramel Boulevard.  The Facility consists of a production building and a small wastewater treatment building south of the production building.  The production building is a brick fronted, single story, metal frame structure approximately 400,000 square feet in size.  The building houses production, offices, and the Candy Store.  The wastewater treatment system consists of a small cinder block structure housing the equipment for the activated sludge system including the sludge filterpress and disposal container.  \nThe Facility began production in May 1995.  The Plant operates 24-hours a day with two production shifts and one maintenance shift.  Facility operations include receiving and storage of raw materials, measurement of the various ingredients into specific batch quantities, blending of ingredients prior to hand finishing of the various chocolates, packaging, and warehousing of the product prior to shipment.  \nThe property grounds are open with access to employee parking and the Candy Store form the west side from Caramel Boulevrd.  Area land-use is primarily agricultural, with some residential structures.  Mud Creek lies approximately one mile to the east.  \n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System Description:  The Facility maintains a milk and nug cooler, as well as a -10 degree F freezer unit.  The cooler, freezer and the Plant process water coolers and air conditioners are cooled using two independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  The total charge on the two systems is approximately 23,200 pounds of ammonia.  Each of the ammonia systems includes a receiving tank, suction accumulator, compressors, evaporative condensers, and associated piping to the units served.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e systems are closed loops, and little or no ammonia is needed annually to replenish minor losses due to routine maintenance activities.  \nThe larger of the two ammonia systems, referred to as the South System, contains approximately 16,200 pounds of ammonia and serves the milk and nut cooler as well as air cooling Niagara units and water cooling.  The smaller system, referred to as the North System, contains approximately 7,000 pounds of ammonia and serves the -10 degree F freezer.  Both refrigeration systems are visually inspected daily by the operators.  \nEach system is provided with emergency pressure relief valves piped to diffusers on the roof of the building.  Roof mounted relief valves are monitored and alarmed for 100 ppm ammonia.  The mechanical rooms where the receivers are located are equipped with ammonia sensors that trigger an audible alarm throughout the Plant.  In addition to the ammonia sensors, there are either equipment electric panel lights or computer monitoring readings for temperature, pressure, ane/or liquid level on all pressurized elements of the systems."
