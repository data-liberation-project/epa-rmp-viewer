We will continually search for innovative and sustainable ways to develop solutions that meet environmental and societal needs today and for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThe Albemarle Pasadena facility has a robust commitment to emergency response, coordinating site-wide emergency response teams with our site partners, Houston Ship Channel industry neighbors, and local authorities.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Albemarle Pasadena plant produces a variety of organic industrial chemicals that are sold and transported around the world.  The primary product group at the plant is a family of chemicals known as organometallics.  The primary use of these chemicals is as a catalyst in the plastics and other industries.  Some of the organometallics are also used on-site in the production of other specialty organic chemicals, including industrial intermediates, agricultural chemicals, and curatives.  Albemarle also handles many of the utility services for the complex, including steam production, potable water, thermal transfer fluids, and compressed air.  Albemarle Pasadena shares its site with partner companies.\r\n\r\nPer \u00a768.130, there are six chemicals regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program that are present above the threshold quantity at the Albemarle Pasadena site.  Listed toxic chemicals are chlorine and methyl chloride.  Listed flammable chemicals are 1-butene, ethyl chloride, 2-methylpropene (isobutene), and isopentane.  Anhydrous hydrogen chloride, ethylene, and hydrogen are used on the plant site from pipeline supplies, though these chemicals are not stored or present on site above the threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nChlorine is used onsite for water treatment purposes and has a maximum storage capacity of 8,000-lb.  \r\n\r\nMethyl chloride, ethyl chloride, 1-butene, and 2-methylpropene, are each used as reactants in the production of different organometallics.  When methyl chloride is used and stored onsite, the capacity is under 200"

      "SummaryText": ",000-lb.  When ethyl chloride is used and stored onsite, the maximum storage capacity is 275,000-lb.  Typical ethyl chloride inventory is about half that due to mixing with another chemical.  Maximum storage capacity of 1-butene is 1,200,000-lb, although typical inventory is much less.  Storage capacity for 2-methylpropene is 200,000-lb.\r\nIsopentane is used as a carrier solvent in one of the organometallic production units, and also as a blending solvent when packaging other organometallic products for shipment.  Total plant inventory of isopentane can be up to 400,000-lb, though the maximum storage capacity in any one area is 200,000-lb.\r\n\r\nRegardless of regulatory listing or quantity, Albemarle Pasadena manages all site processes and equipment as if they were covered by the OSHA PSM or EPA RMP standards.  Our release prevention plan and contingency planning programs are tools that we use to manage the potential hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nAlbemarle Corporation has always believed in taking a structured, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  The most significant management system in place is the Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to comply with and exceed the requirements set forth by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The site also aligns its process safety systems with the Risk-Based Process Safety program as promoted by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS).  The site has a dedicated process safety manager and is staffed with qualified, safety-trained engineering leadership.  Operations and maintenance personnel are also trained and qualified for their job tasks.  Employees are empowered and encouraged to identify anything out of the ordinary and take corrective action. \r\n \r\nAll processes (especially those covered by the RMP and PSM standards) are routinely evaluated in a formal process hazard analysis and rea"

Information from these feeds into the engineering and administrative controls strategy for each production unit.\r\n\r\nProcesses are operated and controlled with a computer-based distributive control system that is programmed to alert operators of abnormal conditions and take corrective action when safety limits are threatened.  Independent safety instrumented systems are also implemented for certain process units with higher hazard potential.\r\n\r\nSafety and reliability are incorporated into the design and construction of the process equipment, following industry standard practices such as those from the American Petroleum Institute, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, International Society of Automation, National Fire Protection Association, and the Chlorine Institute.  Albemarle has also developed a number of internal engineering standards that meet or exceed these standards, especially for materials in which Albemarle has extensive experience and expertise, like organometallics. \r\n\r\nThe Albemarle Pasadena site has implemented an aggressive mechanical integrity and inspection program to identify and correct potential problems before they occur.  Processes are routinely inspected for hazards, and corrective actions are implemented in accordance with generally accepted good engineering practices.\r\n\r\nOther aspects of the site programs include a continuous learning and improvement element.  The site aims to report and investigate all incidents, especially minor releases, upsets, and deviations that would not be included in the five-year accident history.  The site conducts routine internal audits of management and operating systems.  All changes to the site's processes and technology are proposed, evaluated, and approved through a dedicated Management of Change program.\r\n\r\nOccupational safety"

A search of our incident database confirmed that there have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage onsite, or any offsite consequences per 40 CFR \u00a768.42 during this five-year period from June 2014 to June 2019.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Albemarle Pasadena plant maintains a contingency plan that consolidates all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plant program provides the essential planning and training to effectively protect workers, emergency responders, the public and the environment during an emergency.  Our emergency response plan is coordinated with that of the community, the Southeast Regional LEPC, the Channel Industries Mutual Aid Association (CIMA) and industrial partners who share our fence line.  This shared fence line defines our chemical complex.  Albemarle participates in the eNotify program for public notification of incidents and activities at the site.\r\n\r\nThe site emergency response team (ERT) is composed of members from all companies operating on the complex.  The ERT consist of four sections that include the fire brigade, the haz-mat team, the rescue team and the emergency medical team.  All team members are trained to the hazardous materials technician level, which allows them to not only respond to fires, but also spills of hazardous material.  To assure that the ERT is ready for any complex emergency, frequent drills are held with our industrial neighbors on the complex.  In addition, the ERT also participates in the local mutual aid (CIMA) drills.  Drills are also used t"
