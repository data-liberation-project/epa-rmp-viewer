Box 6878\nRochester, MN  55903\n\nFor further information contact Jeff Lund, Safety Department - (507) 289-4086\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n          The owners, management and employees of Greenway Cooperative - Chester Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n          The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 168,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario \n       Greenway has developed a worst case scenario; however, it has been withheld as security sensitive material as requested by the EPA.\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\nGreenway has developed an alternative release scenario; however, it has been withheld as security sensitive material as requested by the EPA.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n          The facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 \", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia \".  In addition, Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules apply.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n          A.  There have been no accidental releases of anh"

There was an accidental release that was caused by an attempted theft of anhydrous ammonia. A highway that is located near the facility was closed temporarily until the release was mitigated. General guidance suggests that this would be considered an evacuation\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\n          The facility has:  \n               a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 \n                   CFR 1910.38;\n               b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and \n                   community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III \n                   (EPCRA);\n               c.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
