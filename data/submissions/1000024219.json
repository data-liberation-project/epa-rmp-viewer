Due to our extensive experience and understanding in the hazards and risks which our products may pose to the general public and our employees, we are committed to operating under the safest possible conditions, with the best-trained employees, and using the most suitable equipment. Executive Management has made safety a priority at our facility, and this philosophy has been communicated to all employees.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nSGA's main activities include receiving of bulk gases from vendor, transfilling gases into smaller packages (i.e. cylinders), storing the gases in cylinders, and distributing these gases to customers by truck. Gases that fall under EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements include:\n1)Propane - maximum 107,000 lbs in a stationary bulk tank and 23,437 lbs in a separate stationary bulk tank\n2)Propylene - maximum 28,560 lbs in stationary bulk tank\n3)Methyl Chloride - maximum 28,000 lbs in transportable ISO trailer and 28,000 lbs in cylinders\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to RMP, SGA also has Process Safety Management (PSM) in place for the above and other gases (under threshold quantities) we have on site.  The adoption of PSM and RMP, along with Executive Management's emphasis on safety has allowed SGA to constantly improve on the safety aspect of our standard operating procedures and processes. Activities such as preventive maintenance, emergency planning and response, management of change, employee training and participation, and Process Hazard Analysis cause SGA to continually learn and modify its practices to reflect a higher respect for safety for employees and the community. Some examples of conscious effort in the name of safety include:\n\n1)Avoiding unnecessary release of Methyl Chloride by having a capturing cylinder to "

SGA's Emergency Response Team only responds to minor leaks. Local first responders such as the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Fire Departments are immediately contacted to respond to any emergency situations that our own Emergency Response Team is not capable of handling. Employees are also trained for emergency evacuations.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nThere are currently no major plans to improve safety other than constantly testing, reviewing, and modifying our PSM program to ensure its effectiveness. We continually gather and evaluate employee feedback regarding safety concerns with our processes.\n"
