This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nWater Facilities Authority maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority facility receives State Project water from the eastern branch of the California Aqueduct via the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD).  The plant processes include flow measurement and control, chemical mixing and flow distribution, flocculation and sedimentation, filtration, effluent distribution, and solids handling and waste wash-water processes.  Chlorine is used in several of these processes for disinfection, taste and odor control, algae control, and color control.\n\nThe existing chlorine system consists of four main subsystems: (1) Storage and Supply, which includes the one ton container storage and feed piping; (2) Feed, which includes pressure reducing valves and chlorinators and their associated piping; (3) Distribution and Injection, which includes the chlorine vacuum piping, injectors, and solution lines; and (4) Control, which includes flow pacing and residual chlorine feedback control.  \n\nLiquid "

      "SummaryText": "chlorine is delivered to the plant in one ton containers, typically with a maximum of 16 containers (32,000 pounds) kept in the storage area.  Chlorine is withdrawn as gas from the one ton containers and passed through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate.  This concentrated solution is then injected at several points throughout the plant: the flash mix vault, the sedimentation basin effluent channels, the filter effluent channel, the filter effluent vault and the plant effluent vault.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine stored in a one ton container (2000 pounds) in a ten minute period.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  This potential release reaches off site of the facility boundaries and may impact population receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine through a quarter inch leak over an hour within the enclosed chlorine storage room.  The  meteorological conditions were : 3.0 m/s and D stability.  This potential release reaches off site of the facility boundaries and may impact population receptors.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA 5189 regulation to ensure safe handling and management of the chlorine treatment process.  Chlorine detection systems are in place to enable a quick response to any chlorine releases.  Employee emergency training is an ongoing process at the facility, with drills conducted frequently to ensure familiarity with the response procedures.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of chlorine at this facility over the last five years (January 1994 through January "

      "SummaryText": "1999).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority has an Emergency Response Team that is trained at the Hazardous Materials Technician Level.  This team is specially trained and equipped to respond to chlorine leaks.  All responders undergo annual refresher training in addition to response drills that are conducted at least quarterly.  The local police, fire, and hazardous materials agencies have been integrated into the facility response plan.  Through cooperative efforts between these agencies, all efforts have been made to notify and protect the public in the unlikely event of an accidental release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority plans to install equipment which will serve to better the safety conditions of the Upland facility.  Among these installations are:\n\n(1) Chlorine scrubber proposed to be installed in year 2000-2001.\n\n(2) Proposed indoor containment or loading/unloading facility to provide passive mitigation during loading and unloading of chlorine cylinders."
