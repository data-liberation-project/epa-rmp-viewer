Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nFresh and Easy - Campus Produce is located at 1730 Eastridge Drive, in Riverside, California.  The facility is approximately 0.6 miles West of Interstate 215 and 1.0 miles South of Interstate 215 / Highway 60.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial and industrial areas.  The facility started up the system and began operations in August 2007.\n\nThe primary business of the Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce facility is to process, store, and distribute perishable food products.  In order to conduct initial operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 42,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing, sto"

Table 1 lists the ammonia equipment at the facility while Figure 1 shows the location of the facility and Figure 2 shows the facility plot plan.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures:\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\nA?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP);\nA?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\nA?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Safe Work Practices program ensures that Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce employees and contractors follow Lockout / Tagout, Hazard Communication, Hot Work (e.g. welding), and Chemical and General Safety Procedures in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take speci"

IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\nA?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \nA?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\nA?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nEngineering Measures:\nThe Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shutdown switches that kill power to the equipment (located outside each Engine Room door and in the Outdoor Equipment Area), relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation (controlled by a thermostat) in the Engine Room to prevent explosions. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will:\n\n25 ppm:    Sends off an email alarm notification to supervisors and the security system monitoring company, who then calls the City of Riverside Fire Department.\n\n150 ppm:    The emergency exhaust fan switches on in the Engine Room and the plant-wide visual strobe and audible alarm are activated.  \n\n2000 ppm:     Level 1 and 2 items remain active.  Ammonia equipment is automatically de-energized.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince starting the system in August 20"

      "SummaryText": "07, there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\nA?    save lives;\nA?    minimize and avoid injuries;\nA?    protect the environment; and\nA?    minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed on March 15, 2011.  These studies generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce facility located in Riverside, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Fresh and Easy - Campus Produce safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.     Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.     Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.     Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.     Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed. \n"
