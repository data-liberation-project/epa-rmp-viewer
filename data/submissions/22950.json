The facility Policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of Farmers Union Oil Co. are committed to the prevention\nof any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \nprepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize\nthe impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2.Facility information\n     a. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop \nproduction nutrients.\n\n     b.  The maximum quantity stored would be 135,150 pounds in our 12,000 & 18,000 gallon storage tanks\nThe maximum quantity handled would be the 81,090 pounds in the 18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 81,090 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.\nthe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.24 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history(or the most likely potential\nincident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to \n200 ppm) is .6 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n    A.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,\" Published by the American National Standards Institute,Inc.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\n    a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.\n"
