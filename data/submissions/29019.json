It is the intention of Midway Lane Plant's management to provide safe and healthy working conditions and to establish and insist upon safe practices at all times by all employees. The prevention of accidents is an objective affecting all levels of our company and its operations. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that each supervisor make the safety of all employees an integral part of his or her regular management function. It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. Employees are expected to assist management in accident prevention activities. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately. Safety is everyone's business.\n\nPURPOSE AND GOALS FOR THE MIDWAY LANE PLANT\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACTION PLAN\nEmergency Response And Action Plans (ERAP) were developed by Belvan Corporation for its Midway Lane Plant located in Crockett County, Texas.  The ERAP was developed to assist the Midway Lane Plant Foreman in his responsibility to provide skilled and compliant emergency leadership in the event of emergency situations.\nThe ultimate goals of the Midway Lane Plant ERAP are as follows:\n\t1.\tTo provide Midway Lane Plant employees with emergency prevention training that will allow them to avoid process emergencies by predicting and recognizing potentially hazardous situations.\n\t2.\tTo provide Midway Lane Plant employees with emergency prevention training that will allow them to recognize and assess the consequences of personal actions when working  with equipment containing pressurized,  very cold, highly volatile,  and flammable substances.\n\t3.\tTo assure that Midway Lane Plant employees will respond in a safe, prompt, and compliant fashion in the event of unintentional r"

New and change in status employees have been trained when assigned to perform any duties that involve the handling of hazardous chemicals.  This facility has an Emergency Shut-Down Procedure that describes the steps to be taken in order for normal operations to be stopped and utility service to be cut off as personnel evacuate the premises during emergency situations.  The Foreman is responsible for accounting for all employees, personally or through a designee, by having all employees report to predetermined, designated rally point and conducting  a head count. Rescue and medical duties will be performed by EMS personnel from the Ozona, Texas Fire Department. The employees of the facility will be notified by verbal notification if  an evacuation is necessary.  All personnel have been trained in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of the premises. The training includes, but is not limited to, the Emergency Shu"

Training was and/or will be provided for employees when:\n1. \tThe plan was initiated\n2. \tResponsibilities change\n3. \tEmployees are hired or transferred.\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n The worst-case scenario would involve some sort of mechanical object (e.g. plane, vehicle, crane) to hit or rupture the storage tank of  the Natural Gas Liquid Storage Tank.\nThe Natural Gas Liquid Storage Tank contains 45,100 lbs. of flammable substance with a worst-case scenario radius of exposure of 1,584 feet. There are no houses in the radius of the plant. \nThe alternative release scenario could be caused by the following items:\na) \tCompressor or Pump piping failure due to vibration fatigue, packing failure and excessive pressure.\nb) \tPressure vessel gage glass breakage.\nc) \tControl and block valve packing failure.\nd) \tPressure relief valve failure due to failure to open or stuck open.\ne) \tCold brittle metal fracture.\nIn many of the direct chemical release scenarios, it is relatively easy to forecast where the release will evolve.   Using the RMP Comp. Program on figuring the radius of exposure. With a 2 inch opening and 6 feet above the opening is the fluid level in the tank. The rate of flow would be 316 lbs. per min. and will take about 70 min. to drain the contents of the tank. The radius is .3 miles and will incorporate no houses. \nThis facility has had no accidents involving a regulated chemical in the last five years, that has involved death, injury, or emergency response. Our facility has procedures coordinated with the local response agencies encase of  an accidental release.\nThis facility follows the rules and regulations of  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency(EPA),  and the Texas Railroad Commission(TNRCC).This facility has labeled all their storage tanks with identifying signs and NFPA labels"
