      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION \n\n\n\nChoctaw County Generating Station is a natural gas-fired, electric power generating station located near French Camp, Mississippi. This 192-acre facility is located 1.5 miles west of French Camp, MS and 90 miles northeast of Jackson, MS, near the intersection of Highway 407 and the Natchez Trace Parkway. \n\n \n\nThe station currently employs approximately 12 full-time staff and a few contract employees. The facility was constructed and began operations in 2003, but went into \"mothball\" status in 2004. The facility returned to commercial operation status in 2007 and has remained in operation since that time.\n\n \n\nThe facility generates 844 MW of power from three natural-gas fired turbines. Each turbine unit is equipped with a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program. The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is a 30% solution of ammonia in water. \n\n\n\nIt should be noted that this facility was originally incorrectly classified as a Program 2 facility. During the course of the 2008 5-year renewal, it was determined that the facility should be classified as a Program 1 facility. No changes were made to the aqueous ammonia process to necessitate this change, and no changes have been made to the aqueous ammonia process since the 2008 RMP renewal. The facility maintains procedures and practices that are designed to meet the requirements of a Program 2 facility, and continues to keep the public informed on the facility's prevention and protection efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE \n\n\n\nCorporate policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.

USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at Choctaw County Generating Station is designed to remove NOx from boiler flue gas by SCR. This is accomplished by injecting an approximately 30% ammonia solution into the flue gas.\n\n\n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the RMP regulatory threshold. \n\n\n\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system at Choctaw County Generating Station is comprised of one storage tank, transfer pumps, piping, instrumentation, and controls. The piping terminates at the vaporizer for each unit, where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized. The storage tank has a capacity of 31,862-gallons. Administrative controls are in place to ensure that the tank is not filled beyond 85% of its capacity (i.e. 9'5\" liquid height or 27,083 gallons). For purposes of RMP release calculations, a conservative potential release amount of 30,000 gallons has been used. The tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve and vacuum breaker, as well as pressure and level indicators. The tank is located in a concrete diked area for secondary containment. The aqueous ammonia tanker truck unloading connections are located within the same secondary containment as the storage tank. \n\n\n\n\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\na. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) assumes that the entire contents of the aqueous ammonia tank is spilled into the secondary containment area, over time. The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for Choctaw County Generating Station this is the use of secondary containment to minimize ammonia liquid spills. The potential quantity released is calculated using:\n\n\n\n30,000 gallons * 7.4626 lb/gal = 223,878 lb \n\n\n\nPer EPA guidance, because the h"

      "SummaryText": "orizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (1960 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool), the rate at which the material is released is calculated as:\n\n\n\n1.4 x LFA (0.026 lb/min/ft2) x 1960 ft2 = 71.3 lb/minute \n\n\n\nb. DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT \n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of this accidental release scenario were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, online version).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following improbable weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, a temperature of 77 deg F, and relative humidity of 50%. In addition, although the facility is located in a \"rural\" area, \"urban\" topography was used to model the dispersion created by the power plant buildings and surrounding forest.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.2 miles for the worst-case scenario for aqueous ammonia. This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public. There are no public or environmental receptors within the radius of impact. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components: \n\n\n\n- The ammonia storage tank is built to exacting standard;\n\n\n\n- Ammonia tank trucks will only by unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays;\n\n\n\n- A comprehensive plan covering all components of the aqueous ammonia system with respect to operation, maintenance, inspection, and training is in place at the facility;\n\n\n\n- Internal compliance audits are conducted regularly;\n\n\n\n- All incidents related to the aqueous ammonia system are investigated promptly.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nNo accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have "

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release of ammonia would occur, an emergency response plan for the ammonia storage and handling system has been developed. This plan incorporates elements of the facility's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). Choctaw County Generating Station employees have been trained on this plan and would be first to respond in the event of an emergency. All Choctaw County Generating Station employees are trained and certified in HeartSaver First Aid and Class A, B, and C Fire Fighting. The French Camp Volunteer Fire Department would provide the first EMT response to the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nAll station safety programs, including the emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities. A hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Choctaw County Generating Station was last conducted prior to start-up of the system in 2003. There are no planned changes to the system at this time.\n\n"
