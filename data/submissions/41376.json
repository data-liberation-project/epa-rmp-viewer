The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  MAP LLC Texas City Refinery does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like MAP LLC Texas City Refinery.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  For some of these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred.  In all cases, if such events occurred, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect our employees, contractors, and people in the community.  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1.4\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the MAP LLC Texas City Refinery.

New employees receive basic training in Texas Refining Division operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (i.e., through tests, skills demonstrations, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Texas Refining Division uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Texas Refining Division has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:  (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Texas Refining Division personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Texas Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and eval"

For each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\r\n\r\nTexas City Refinery has experienced NO accidents during the past five years involving regulated substances from RMP-covered processes that had any reportable onsite or offsite effects.\r\n\r\n1.6\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe MAP LLC Texas City Refinery maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our written program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities  and affected personnel are informed of/trained on the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emer"

      "SummaryText": "gency response program for the Texas City Refinery is coordinated with the Texas City-LaMarque-Hitchcock local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and with the Texas City emergency management officials.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, we conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.  Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.7\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe MAP LLC Texas City Refinery constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  We resolve all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility during the next five years to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\r\n\r\n* Upgrade process plant building construction to enhance protection of operating personnel\r\n\r\n* Continually upgrade engineering drawings of covered processes to ensure that accurate information is always available to plant personnel\r\n\r\n* Provide closed loop sampling system for process fluids to enhance operator safety\r\n\r\n* Continually upgrade process control schemes to improve reliability of cover"
