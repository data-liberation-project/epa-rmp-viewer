The primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  Hydrogen chloride is received and stored in high pressure tube trailers that contain 3,000 - 3,500 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride in each tube.  The tube trailers are transferred into cylinder and ton containers for shipment to customer sites.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\nThe total inventory of hydrogen chloride at the Phoenix facility exceeds the threshold quantity established in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\nAt Linde we are driven to ensure no harm comes from our actions to people, the environment or the communities in which we operate. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment, process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical\r\nreleases, and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.  Linde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Policy\r\nIt is the policy of the Phoenix facility to prepare and respond to all emergencies as outlined in the Phoenix Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes the actions and responsibilities for employees and site emergency responders in the event of an emergency to ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the community.  The plan also includes pre-planning, drills, and critiques to ensure the site is prepared to respond to an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management\r\nProgram rule, the Phoenix facility has developed a comprehensive p"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\r\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the\r\nhazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical\r\noperating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\r\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as\r\nprocess operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot\r\nwork permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity.\r\n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive\r\ndesign safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and\r\npre-startup review.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix facility has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program is audited a minimum of every 3 years by our internal audit team to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented daily leak checks and safety features specific to the covered process at our facility.  Hydrogen chloride atmospheric monitors are in place to detect leaks and ensure the safety of our employees and the community.  This system is designed to stop the transfer of hydrogen chloride in the event of a leak.  In addition, pull switches have been added to our tube trailers to stop the flow"

      "SummaryText": "in the event of a trailer tow away.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThe Phoenix facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\nThe Phoenix facility has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of an accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.  The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a release of hydrogen chloride.  The plan\r\ncomplies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and is coordinated with local emergency response agencies.  All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to the commencement of work.  The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to ensure effectiveness and changes are made to the plan if deficiencies are found.  The site has trained Emergency Responders at the technician level and Linde maintains trained technical level Emergency Responders on 24 hr call throughout the US.\r\n \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nLinde continuously improves the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and by soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  A major upgrade to the site Life Safety System is currently in the planning stage. The updated Life safety system will consist of new area gas monitors, emergency strobe lights and PA announcement system. The system will be integrated into a new custom SCADA system.   Ongoing improve projects include site wide LED lighting upgrades, site security gate and fencing upgrades and site closed circuit monitoring upgrades."
