The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  A Fire Water System that includes directional monitors has been installed within the process area and around large storage tanks and vessels with the primary purpose to keep piping, vessels, and tanks cool in the event of a fire.  \r\n\r\nIn addition foam fire-fighting capabilities are provided for any Natural Gasoline loading or storage facilities which include the Rail Loading Rack and the 750 bbl and 60,000 bbl Storage Tanks.  The 60,000 bbl Natural Gasoline Storage Tank has a foam system for the floating roof.  The 50,000 bbl Butane Sphere is equipped with a water deluge system for coverage over the entire storage vessel.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Plant processes.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThere are numerous plans in place to fully implement and improve safety and enviro"

The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the Harrison Hub Complex (HHC) is to fractionate natural gas liquids (NGLs) into marketable components including ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline.  The NGLs are delivered to the HHC through an inlet Surge Vessel and then pumped through the fractionation process which includes a De-Ethanizer Tower, De-Propanizer Tower and De-Butanizer Tower.  Overheads from the De-Ethanizer consist primarily of ethane and are pumped into an ethane pipeline that transports the ethane to a main product pipeline that is operated by a 3rd party.  The bottoms from the De-Ethanizer are routed to the De-Propanizer.  Overheads from the De-Propanizer consist primarily of propane and are pumped into horizontal storage vessels in the Tank Farm that are located outside the processing area.  Propane is also transported via a pipeline that delivers the propane to a product pipeline that is operated by a third party.  Bottoms from the De-Propanizer are routed to the De-Butanizer and associated process equipment.  Overheads from the De-Butanizer consist mainly of mixed butanes and are pumped into horizontal storage vessels in the Tank Farm or to a 50,000 bbl Butane Sphere.  Bottoms from the De-Butanizer are recovered as Natural Gasoline and are routed to either the 750 BBL Natura"

All products are routed to a Rail Loading Facility for transport.  A Truck Loading Rack is also available for Propane.  \r\n  \r\nOther major equipment at the Plant includes a Hot Oil Heater that provides a heat medium which is used for recovering the various products in the Fractionation Process.  This is the only major piece of equipment that utilizes natural gas.  All other major equipment including pumps and motors utilize electricity. \r\n \r\nAs a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the Plant at any given time. \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the Harrison Hub Complex NGL Fractionation covered process and according to 40 CFR \u00a768.3 Definitions - Stationary Source, the 2019 RMP Submittal will incorporate the five previous processes which included: Butane Storage, Propane Storage, Natural Gasoline Storage, NGL Fractionation Trains, and Butane Sphere into a single covered process.    \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at the HHC.  The HHC has been classified as a Program 3 because public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.
