      "SummaryText": "Dixon Farm Partnership has operated a farm in Girard, Georgia for the past 30 years. We are developing a comprehensive emergency response plan and an accident prevention program in place at our facility in response to the new RMP program.  We are also in the process of cooperating with public emergency planning agencies to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank is empty and has not been used in aproximately 5 years.   We are filing this RMP volentarily because it may be utilized at some future unknown date.  The facility's single 12,000 tank is equipped with pressure relief valves and gauges to prevent overpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with excess flow devices that will automatically shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  The tank and pipes also feature manual shutoff valves to stop and isolate a leak so that it can be repaired.  The facility has a water purging system to clear any extraneous product from the transfer lines after use.  There is a water supply located at the fill station to rinse away any product in case of accidental skin contact.\n\nThe worst case scenario indicate that businesses and residences offsite will be affected in the event of a catastrophic tank failure.  However we believe that our vigorous safety and emergency response programs greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario from happening.  The alternative case release scenario is a more accurate assessment of risk to the community.  In the alternate release scenario the toxic endpoint was less than a tenth of a mile and would not breach the borders of the facility."
