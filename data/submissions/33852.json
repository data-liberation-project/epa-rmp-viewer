      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Joseph Jensen Filtration Plant (Jensen Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nThe Jensen Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response pol"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for chlorine involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Jensen Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan is being  coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  Jensen Plant has an excellent safety record with chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MWDSC Joseph Jensen Filtration Plant is located at 13100 Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, California.  The plant is situated south of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) and Antelope Valley Freeway (14) junction, covering 232 acres.

Chlorine is received at the Jensen Plant in a covered unloading area just north of the Administration Building.  The chlorine evaporators and chlorinators are located in the Chlorine Building.  The Chlorine Building is located north of the Administration Building, beside the unloading area.  The chlorine storage and use at the Jensen Plant is subject to EPA and CalARP rules, as well as the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe chlorine unloading area is continuously monitored in the control room by a video camera and chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak sensors are also provided in the chlorine building and chlorine vent boxes, located outside the building.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process, is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, north wall of the main building, or the east wall of the Area Control Center.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided in the chlorine unloading area and outside the chlorine room.\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.  In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the control room.  The filtration plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the filtration plant in the event of a power failure.  \n\nThe control roo"

Jensen Plant also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1991, 1994, 1995, and 1998 detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The 1998 RMP PHA was further reviewed and updated in December 2003 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions were developed in December 2003to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.

The contractors are informed, prior to the initiation of the work at the site, of the applicable provisions of the emergency response plan.  Jensen Plant holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nJensen Plant ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  Jensen Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Jensen Plant has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting plant employees, public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\n\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the facility.

This chlorine containment and neutralization project will markedly reduce the accidental release risk to plant employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The project is currently at the end of the design phase, with construction scheduled to begin late 2005 and the facility is expected to be in operation late 2006."
