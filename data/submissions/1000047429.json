Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWestlake Longview Corporation (WLC) came into existence in December 2006 when Westlake Chemical Corporation purchased Eastman Chemical Company's polyethylene assets located within the Eastman Chemical Company Texas Operations (TXO) plant site near Longview, Texas.  With the sale of these and other assets within TXO, the plant site has developed into a closed access industrial park, also known as the Sabine Industrial District.  WLC's production personnel include TXO Leased Workforce operators.  \r\n\r\nWLC is subject to safety policies and expectations of both Westlake Chemical Corporation and TXO.  The accidental release and emergency response policies of Eastman Chemical Company are summarized in its Administrative Policies.  Per WLC procedure WLC-H&S-001 General Safety Policies, all WLC employees, Leased Workforce operators, and contractors are required as a minimum to follow the TXO Authorized Safe Practice Manual (ASPM).  WLC-H&S-017 Site Emergency Plan designates how WLC will interact with the TXO comprehensive site emergency plan. \r\n\r\nAs described in HSE Standards of Practice, Westlake Chemical Corporation (Westlake) accepts our responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of our employees, their families, and the public. The protection of human health, the environment, and the management of process safety and distribution risks are core values of the corporation and will be managed as an integral part of our business. The goal of all Westlake employees is to achieve continuous and measurable improvement. This policy will be enabled through Corporate HSE policies/management systems and appropriate business or site-level policies and management plans that establish objectives and targets."

      "SummaryText": "y\r\n\r\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, WLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Westlake reviewed its five-year accident history between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 for accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage from covered processes.  One accidental release of 10-100 lbs of ethylene occurred in April 2018.  The release resulted in one non-fatal onsite injury, but no equipment was damaged and no offsite response was necessary.  Westlake revised procedures related to the identified issues to reduce the potential for recurrence. The incident did not result and could not have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of regulated substances; therefore, an incident investigation under 40 CFR \u00a768.81 was not required.\r\n\r\nV. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAs described in WLC procedure WLC-H&S-017 Site Emergency Plan, for emergencies defined as non-routine incidents that do or can result in damage to property or the environment, serious injury to personnel, evacuation, or extensive disruption to production (such as fires, explosions, gas leaks, spills, injuries requiring an ambulance, and disruption of critical utilities) TXO provides the incident commander and emergency response team and establishes an Emergency Operations Center. Coordination between WLC and TXO is also described in this procedure.  Initial incident reports are directed to Plant Protection, TXO. The Plant Protection guard receiving the call notifies emergency response services and WLC representatives as outlined in the TXO comprehensive site emergency response plan.  \r\n\r\nKey elements of the emergency response plan as it relates to community emergency response include, but are not limited to, the following: \r\n-\tTXO maintains an emergency response team whose m"

Each location will implement accident prevention, product stewardship, distribution, occupational health, pollution control, and community outreach programs designed to safeguard employees, visitors, customers, and the public from injuries and health hazards, to protect the environment and Westlake's assets, and maintain continuity of operations.\r\n\r\nBoth WLC and TXO use a safety process that includes six main steps to prevent accidental releases: \r\n-\tHazard identification, prevention, and control;\r\n-\tSafe design and construction;\r\n-\tSafety and health education and training;\r\n-\tEmployee involvement, accountability, and responsibility;\r\n-\tInspection, testing, repair, and preventative maintenance (mechanical integrity); and\r\n-\tSystematic evaluation for continual improvement.\r\n\r\nII.

Since its beginning, WLC has integrated its safety and emergency response practices and processes with those of TXO. Prior to the initial Risk Management Program (RMP) submittal in October 2014, WLC was considered part of the TXO plant site for purposes of compliance with RMP.  In the event of an emergency, TXO provides emergency response services and coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These support services did not change because of the independent RMP submittal; WLC continues to work closely with TXO to ensure a safe work environment and effective emergency response, if needed.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Description\r\n\r\nWLC uses ethylene and propane in quantities above the threshold quan"

In addition, WLC uses anhydrous ammonia and titanium tetrachloride in quantities above the threshold quantity on the List of Regulated Toxic Substances in 40 CFR Section 68.130. \r\n\r\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\r\n\r\nBasic Information:\r\nEthylene is a colorless gas with a sweet odor.  Propane, sometimes referred to as liquefied petroleum gas, is nontoxic, colorless, and virtually odorless. Both of these materials are extremely flammable. Leaks have the potential to ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\nEthylene is the basic building block for polyethylene plastics produced by Westlake. Polyethylene is used in many common items including toys, food containers, automobiles, and garbage bags.  Propane is used as a modifier in some polyethylene product formulations.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, Anhydrous \r\n\r\nBasic Information:\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. Long-term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health effects from inhalation. Gaseous ammonia is lighter than air, but vapors from a leak may initially hug the ground. Ammonia gas is normally not considered a serious fire hazard, but at high enough concentration and under the right conditions, it can ignite and burn. Ammonia is soluble in water, forming a corrosive liquid. \r\n\r\nUses:\r\nWLC uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. \r\n\r\nTitanium Tetrachloride\r\nBasic Information:\r\n\r\nTitanium tetrachloride is a heavy liquid with a yellowish color and a sharp, pungent odor. It reacts with water or atmospheric moisture to produce a white cloud of titanium oxide and hydrochloric acid vapors. Long-term exposure to low concentrations of hydrochloric acid or short-term exposure to high concentrations of hydrochloric"
