Gaston is located near Wilsonville, Alabama and consists of 5 steam electric generating units.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Plant Gaston to provide and maintain safe and healthful working conditions, and an efficient and environmentally safe operation.  The plant has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instruction.\n\n\n\nThe process that requires Plant Gaston to comply with EPA's Risk Management Program regulations for anhydrous ammonia is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction system used to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from the combustion of coal and natural gas to generate electricity. As part of the system, ammonia is injected into the flue gas and aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to harmless nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks on the plant site for use in the SCR system.  The main hazard that would be associated with anhydrous ammonia at Plant Gaston is a toxic hazard.  Trained plant personnel conduct the unloading of anhydrous ammonia from trucks into the storage tanks.  The storage tanks are protected from traffic around the plant by bollards installed around the tanks. Therefore, a rupture that would results in the rapid release of the gas is unlikely.\n\n\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) program under OSHA is in effect for Plant Gaston, therefore Program 3 applies.  \n\n\n\nThe accidential release prevention program at Plant Gaston is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution system is accurate, complete, up to date and"

In addition, Plant Gaston has in place an emergency response plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of a release of ammonia.  The plan covers the following: evacuation plan, recognizing emergencies, emergency action procedures, coordinating personnel, first aid procedures, notifying the public and local response agencies, emergency response contacts, emergency response equipment,emergency alarm system, training and pre-emergency coordination with the Shelby County LEPC.  \n\nNo chemical spills have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years."
