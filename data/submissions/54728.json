      "SummaryText": "The City of Fayetteville owns and operates a Water Treatment Plant in Fayetteville, Tennessee.  For disinfection, the plant uses chlorine, which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance. The threshold quantity of chlorine for PSM applicability (29 CFR 1910.119) is 1,500 pounds.  The threshold quantity for RMP applicability (40 CFR Part 68) is 2,500 pounds.  Since the plant uses and stores chlorine in excess of these thresholds, it is subject to federal requirements including preparation of PSM and RMP programs.  These programs are intended to minimize the health risks to employees and the public from the accidental release of chemicals.  The facility has an excellent accident and chemical release prevention program.  Stringent loading and operation and maintenance procedures have been implemented to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas.  There has never been an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place.  The Emergency Response Program has been evaluated to produce the maximum impact in the least amount of communications and rapid response in an emergency situation.  The staff will respond immediately to a release by taking the following basic actions:  1. Dial 911. Notify the Emergency Management Agency.  2. Contact the fire department hazard response team and verify notification by 911 operator.  3. Evacuate the facilities and appropriate perimeter area.  There are no planned changes as a result of the last safety review."
