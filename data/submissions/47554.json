Prevention of chemical emergencies includes specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, etc. meet all applicable design codes and specifications.  Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation.  Trained and qualified employees work with sophisticated control systems that include instrumentation, alarms, and shutdowns to keep our processes operating in safe limits that minimize adverse impacts on the employees, the surrounding community and/or environment.  \n\nOperating instructions, start-up/shutdown instructions, and consequences of deviation define required operating conditions and steps needed to control normal and out-of-normal conditions.  \n\nUnder PSM, employee involvement in all aspects of plant operations, its safety and environmental programs is required and met at the Calvert City plant.  Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant.  Our Basic Safety Process (BSP) contains many other elements including management of change, hot work procedures, and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology.  All contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that APCI employees must follow under the contractor safety program.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees.  APCI shares emergency response resources on the plant site with the Celanese PVOH plant.

      "SummaryText": "onders and citizens to form a strong Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC.  APCI is an active member of the LEPC and the Calvert City Community Advisory Team (CAT).\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68).   The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen based on the criteria established in the regulation.  \n\n2.     The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe stationary source is the APCI main production facility located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky.  The RMP covered processes are the Air Products Polymers (APP) Emulsions unit and the VAM storage and distribution unit.  \n\nIn the APP Emulsions unit, VAM, ethylene, and/or VCM is batch polymerized in water to form a co-polymer emulsion product.  A number of other chemicals that are not covered by the RMP regulations, may be used to adjust emulsions product properties for specific end uses.  Emulsions products are used in many applications including adhesives, latex paints, and paper coatings.  \n\nThe VAM storage and distribution area at the main production facility receives VAM from tanks at the Tennessee River and stores it on site to continuously supply the APP Emulsions production facility and the Celanese PVOH production facility.  \n\nThe regulated substances handled at this stationary source are:\n?Vinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 433,000 pounds.  \n?Ethylene with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 237,000 pounds\n?Vinyl Chloride with a maximum quantity in an individual process of 60,000 pounds\n\n3.

A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping.  These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.  \n\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in environmental compliance. Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown, and emergency conditions.  Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.  \n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.  Process areas are covered by fire sensors and flammable vapor sensors, fire sprinkler systems, monitor nozzles, dry chemical extinguishers, etc.  Containment dikes around storage tanks and process areas are curbed to contain small spills and direct them to drains to the plant?s chemical sewer and the wastewater treatment plant.  \n\nEach process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and start-up.  All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard Reviews (OPHR's) are conducted by multi-disciplinary teams.  \n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the plant and corporate levels.

      "SummaryText": "ident history:\n\nNone of the stationary sources or covered processes at the Air Products and Chemicals plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years that would be reported under RMP.  There have been no releases of VAM, ethylene, or VCM that have had any off-site consequences, resulted in any employee injuries, or resulted in any significant equipment damage.  \n\n5.    The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is operated jointly with its neighbor, Celanese Ltd., and is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  There are at least 16 trained emergency responders on the fire and rescue squad that are divided into shift and day workers.  Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer.  In an emergency, the safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.  \n\nOn-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck, and a Hazmat Response trailer.  In addition to these resources, APCI is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can draw from pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.  As a member of the LEPC, APCI regularly stages emergency response drills on and off the plant site with emergency responders from the public and private sector.  LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel, and emergency procedures.  \n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe process safety information and systems are evaluated regularly through the Operational Plant Hazard Reviews, with industry wide changes in standards, and as a result of incidents that have occurred within the chemical industry.  The VAM storage tanks and the APP Emulsions plant have no outstanding upgrade recommendations.  \n\nThe Calvert Area Emergency Warning System (CAEWS) is an emergency notification system to alert the community of a chemical and/or weather re"

The 911 operator is backed up by the safety officer at Air Products, who can also activate the system.  In the event of an emergency, 911 would activate the sirens and voice control modules that are placed in public buildings such as the Convalescent Center, City Hall, and the Calvert Elementary School.  Once a citizen has heard the siren, they can tune to the local Calvert City radio station (WCCK) and listen for special instructions.  The sirens are routinely tested on day per month.   \n\nCAEWS also has a telephone notification system that can be activated by any of the ten participating plants.  In the event of a chemical emergency, a plant could activate the system to notify everyone in the community within a five-mile radius of the complex.  These calls notify people of the emergency, instruct them to Shelter-in-place, and tune to their local radio station for more information.  The system can make an All-Clear call to notify everyone that the emergency has passed.  In the event of an incident with no off-site consequences, plants can activate the system to notify emergency responders, plant personnel, and the media that no emergency exists."
