Training is provided by a variety of resources. They may include one or more of the following: third party training professionals, online courses, and in-house classroom sessions. Training is also supplemented with hands on experience along with appropriate response information regarding new chemicals or procedures. The on-site CCI Hazmat Team can handle most releases. There is the potential for significant incidents that are beyond the scope of our internal hazmat team, and aid would be sought from professional hazmat response services.\n\nFacility - \nThe CCI Phoenix facility is completely covered by an ESFR sprinkler system. The general production and warehouse are fully contained within the building which includes a dike to contain any possible spill within the designated area and inside the building.\n\nThe CCI - Phoenix facility is approximately 2.5 miles (6 minutes) from the nearest Phoenix Fire Department (station 14). The nearest hospital is approximately 4.6 miles (12 minutes).\n\nRegulated Substances - \nColumbus Chemical in Phoenix, AZ contains one process for one regulated substance. This process of storage is covered for Hydrofluoric acid 50% or over. The reason for including Hydrofluoric acid in the storage process is due to an expected increase in inventory for new business which will consistently bring inventory over the threshold quantity.\nHydrofluoric acid is purchased between 50-70% HF in drums or IBC totes (for 60% or under). Total net weights of each container will vary, but the maximum amount in a single vessel will be 2205 pounds in an IBC tote. This quantity meets the threshold in the single vessel.
