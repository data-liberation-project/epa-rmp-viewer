The ammonia refrigeration process at High Liner (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. High Liner has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \n\n\n\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Integrated Contingency Plan) as required under OSHA PSM, High Liner has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHigh Liner is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is stored and utilized within the facility's anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process.  The facility has a maximum inventory capacity of 37,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As High Liner's anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at High Liner is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\n\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVE"

      "SummaryText": "NTION STEPS\n\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards Institute / American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers guidance, and American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) guidance.  Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\n\n\n\nAn off-site consequences analysis has been completed for the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to document the radius of impact (i.e., distance to toxic endpoint) for each scenario and the potential population, public receptors and environmental receptors that fall within the radius of impact for each scenario. \n\n\n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of High Liner's daily operations.  PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases; the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by High Liner exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present and are tested every six months.  Relief valves are replaced by an ASME certified agent on a five-year schedule. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there have been no federal reportable releases that caused death, injury, hospitalization or property damage.  \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in process and perimeter locations.  A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.  The ammonia sensors are tested quarterly.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm system auto-dialer is also activated if ammonia is detected.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a process release, the alarm system auto-dialer calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the Portsmouth Fire Department if any of the following conditions are present:\n\n\n\n?

      "SummaryText": "n investigating the incident, High Liner determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance; \n\n?    Reportable quantities of ammonia are released; and\n\n?    A potential for fire exists.\n\n\n\nThe Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC or Portsmouth Fire Department) is trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at High Liner.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Update was conducted in 2014 and identified several areas where process improvements could improve the safety of the facility. Planned changes resulting from the PHA Update include ventilation system upgrades. The ventilation updates are being implemented in multiple phases to increase the make-up air to Engine Room #1 and make the effects of the engine room exhaust fans neutral to the surrounding areas of the plant.  A PHA addendum for the ventilation system updates was completed in September 2015.\n\n"
