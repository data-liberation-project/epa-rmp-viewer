      "SummaryText": "Welch Foods, Inc. (Welch's) is a membership cooperative marketing association representing fruit growers.  The Welch's facility in Grandview, Washington is comprised of two fruit juice processing plants owned by Welch's. The facility is involved in production of concentrated fruit juices and by-products. Two processes located within the facility boundary use a chemical subject to the RMP regulation - ammonia - for refrigeration purposes.  These are the Grandview (Plant #1) and Yakima Valley (Plant #2) processes.  The Plant #1 and Plant #2 refrigeration systems each contain more than the 10,000 pound threshold of ammonia.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations, Welch's has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect workers and the surrounding community from exposure to anhydrous ammonia.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using a modified what-if?/checklist approach.  The checklist was an industry standard assessment developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Welch's facility and experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm.\n\nWelch's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The plan includes a preventive maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Welch's facility's emergency response "

Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  Facility personnel at all levels have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safety workplace and surrounding community."
