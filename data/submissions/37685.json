It is SupHerb Farms? policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is SupHerb Farms? objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nSupHerb Farms emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for SupHerb Farms and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nSupHerb Farms has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which will be used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and CalARP regulations.  At least every three years, SupHerb Farms will audit these programs and any findings of noncompliance will be documented and responded to and the deficiencies will be corrected.\n\n    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nSupHerb Farms owns and operates a herb and specialty vegetable processing plant located on 300 Dianne Drive in Turlock, California.  The plant began commercial operation in March, 1993.  The facility is located on eleven acres of land and is comprised of an office, warehouse, indoor and outdoor processing areas, and open space.  \n\nHerbs and specialty vegetables are unloaded from trucks at the processing facility and are washed with water prior to entering the process lines.  The herbs and specialty vegetables are fresh frozen or freeze dried.  Depending on the final product, the herbs and specialty vegetables are processed through a drying unit and chive freezer, an Instant Quick Freeze "

Cold storage is also provided within the warehouse for holding incoming herbs and specialty vegetables and packaged final products.\n\nAt SupHerb Farms, anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system provides process cooling for the IQF freezer, chive freezer, sifting room, holding freezer, packing room, and the shipping and receiving rooms.  The major components of the SupHerb Farms refrigeration system are the high pressure receiver, high side and low side accumulators, evaporators, compressors, an intercooler, condensers, an air purger, and the oil drain pots.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be ?pumped down? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 16,274 pounds. \n\nChlorine is utilized as a biocide to disinfect the process water in the facility.  The source of chlorine for the chlorination system during normal operations is a one ton container.  When the contents of the one ton container are consumed, the chlorinator is transferred to 150 pound chlorine cylinders to accommodate one ton container exchanges without significantly interrupting chlorination of the process water.  A one ton container and two 150 pound cyinders may be on-site resulting in a maximum chlorine inventory of 2300 pounds.\n\nThe characteristics and hazards of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are discussed briefly in Section 6.0 of this document and more extensively in Volume I, Section II of the PSM Supporting Document.  For purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the CalARP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm) and for chlo"

Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n?    An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n?    Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n?    Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n?    Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n?    Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n?    A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n?    Pre-startup safety reviews are performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n?    Audits are conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP"

The President has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n\nSupHerb Farms has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system or the chlorination that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\n    Emergency Response Program\n\nSupHerb Farms has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  \n\n    Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSince the last PHAs were performed in August, 1996, the following changes were made to the ammonia-based refrigeration system to improve safety:\n\n1.    An ambient ammonia monitoring and detection system was installed to cover the ammonia refrigeration system.  The ammonia monitoring and detection system provides alarm functions for minor leaks and emergency shutdowns of the ammonia refrigeration system in the event of a major leak.\n\n2.    Installation of an ammonia diffusion system.  The pressure relief valve discharge header and the vent from the ?Fire Department? emergency refrigerant control box are now piped into a 20,000 gallon water tank.   This 20,000 gallon water tank can prevent an atmospher"
