This\n\ncommitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas\n\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\n\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\n\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\n\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 490 F Street in Lemoore, California. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to\n\nprovide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is approximately 70,000 lb.\n\n\n\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\n\nout under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM\n\nstandard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\n\nstationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\n\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\n\nidentified and controlled efficiently.
