Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  Maplehurst Bakeries, Inc. is located in Brownsburg, Indiana and manufactures food products.  The facility utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for process cooling and product freezing.  Maplehurst Bakeries, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas including: design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and employee training associated with the regulated process at the facility.   \n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:  The facility is a commercial bakery that utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for process cooling and product freezing.  The system is a closed loop process and does not normally necessitate re-filling or unloading of ammonia. Access to the entire facility is controlled and further access to the ammonia process is limited to authorized employees and approved contractors.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated RMP substance present at the facility.    \n\n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:    The facility has an established accident release prevention program that complies with OSHA?s PSM and EPA?s RMP programs. The PSM/RMP Prevention Program consists of the following elements:\n\n - Process Safety Information\n - Process Hazard Analysis\n - Operating Procedures\n - Mechanical Integrity\n - Management of Change\n - Pre-startup Review\n - Hot Work Permits\n - Contractor Evaluations\n - Incident Investigation\n - Employee Participation\n - Training\n - Compliance Audits\n\n4. Five-year accident history:  The facility has not had any reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n5.
