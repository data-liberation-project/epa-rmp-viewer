      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the polyurethane foam manufacturing system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Carpenter Co. - Lathrop facility maintains and operates a process system comprised of Methyl Formate and Toluene Diisocyanate, 80:20 TDI blend (80 wt% 2,4 TDI and 20 wt% 2,6 TDI) hereby referred to as TDI. Not including unloading of the regulated chemicals Methyl Formate and TDI to their respective storage tanks, there is one process these regulated chemical are involved in.\n\n\n\nChemical injection process for polyurethane foam equipment for the regulated substances involved in the manufacturing of polyurethane foam include: one large TDI storage tank, one large Methyl Formate storage tank, one small Methyl Formate storage tank, two Methyl Formate feed pumps, one Methyl Formate pump metering skid, two heat exchangers, one TDI low pressure feed pump, one TDI high pressure metering pump, and up to two small Methyl Formate ISO containers which can be used in reserve. Both Methyl Formate and TDI are individually piped and do not come into contact with one another until they meet at the mixing head where the foam is poured. Additionally, there can be up to four TDI railcars stored onsite. Details of the inventory calculation can be found in the Process Safety Information (PSI) section of the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the regulated toxic chemical involved in the polyurethane foam"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the regulated toxic chemical involved in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process (TDI). The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nAlthough both the handling of Methyl Formate and TDI and the production of polyurethane foam have inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a Methyl Formate and/or TDI release. The facility utilizes pressure relief valves, manual and automated shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of the Prevention Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of Methyl Formate and TDI. Prevention elements for each program are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\nList of Prevention Program Elements:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Pre-Startup Saf"
