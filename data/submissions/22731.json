The program is described in detail in the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process.  \n\nSeveral changes were made to the facility since the original RMP was developed in 1999 to improve safety and to accomodate the new Reclaim Plant.  The changes completed in 2000 include raising the level of the chlorine tanks and adding new scales in the storage room"

Accordingly, the City of Westminster has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP for the chlorine system.  The City of Westminster has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard will eventually apply to the personnel at the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, the City of Westminster affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  \nAccordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nThe City of Westminster takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operate"

The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nThe City of Westminster management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, the City of Westminster has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility is located at 13150 N. Huron, Adams County, Colorado.  The Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility utilizes chlorine to disinfect the water it treats prior to discharge to the Big Dry Creek.  The Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility treats the wastewater for the northern portion of Westminster.  It is an activated sludge plant designated by the State of Colorado as a Class A plant.  The Facility received an award from EPA for the best plant operating in Region VIII in 1986 and 1992.\n\nThe Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of water.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six containers (12,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility is regulated under the RMP rule due to the vo"

For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that a full one-ton container of chemical is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions as specified in the RMP regulation are also assumed to be present.  The release is also assumed to occur outdoors.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, the facility reviewed the consequences of a valve breaking off at the container connector during hookups in the storage area.  No active mitigation was considered.\n\nResults of the off-site consequence analyses are described in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*Submit plan for the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n\u00b7 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n\n\u00b7 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n\n\u00b7 Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions\n\n\u00b7 Training for each Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility employee involved in operating the chlo"
