      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nPhibro Tech Inc, is committed to the safety and well being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  Our products include etchants for the Printed Wire Board (PWB) industry.  In the production of this product it is necessary to use ahnydrous ammonia.  Phibro_Tech's  policys is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material form occuring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly, yet safely to such a release.\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of the following regulated substance at the Phibro-Tech Inc. facility located at 1000 N. First Street, Garland, Texas 75040.   ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12000 gallon (water) tank.  The tank is periodically filled by experienced Anhydrous Ammonia Manufacturer's Delivery trucks as needed.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of fresh etchant.  No repackaging takes place.\nWORST CASE & ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS\nEPA has defined the Worst Case Scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage vessel in ten minutes, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions.  Our scenario would involve our 12,000 gallon (water) tank filled to 85%.  EPA has also specified in the RMP rule that each facility must define a specific alternate or Realistic scenario hat could also have off-site impact based on plant operations.  The realistic scenarios are to be modeled using the actual active and pasive mitigation systems that are in place if they are capable of withstanding the event that triggered the release during typical weather conditions. Our realistic scenario is the release that would occur from a rupture in the one inch schedule 80 pipe network leading from the ammonia tank.  This scenario has offsite impact.\nACCI"

      "SummaryText": "DENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nPhibro-Tech Inc has a comprehensive release prevention program in accordance with the Federal RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirments.  We have in place, physical safeguards to prevent a release of anhydrous ammonia.  We follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentaion.  Our process design includes pressure relief valves and excess flow valving  to safeguard against overpressure and pipeline rupture and/or ecessive flow.\nFIVE YEAR RELEASE HISTORY\nThere has been no release of ahnydrous ammonia prior to the original submittal  date of this program.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\nPhibro-Tech has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installed excess flow valve and two remote shut-offs with alarm.\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nA security cage has been installed over the fill lines to the storage tank.  The cage is kept locked.  This prevents the possibilty of theft or release of the anhydous ammonia."
