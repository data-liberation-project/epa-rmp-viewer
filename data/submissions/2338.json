      "SummaryText": "The main purpose of South Davis Sewer Improvement (SDSID) Risk Management Plan  (RMP) is to prevent releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that could expose district employees and the public. This RMP program includes:\n    1) Section 1 - an executive summary of SDSID's RMP;\n    2) Section 2 - an assessment of the potential impacts of a major chlorine or sulfur dioxide release; \n    3) Section 3 - a prevention program that details the intrinsic/extrinsic safeguards, control strategies and personnel procedures that are in place at the district; \n    4) Section 4 - an emergency response plan that describes the districts response in the event of a major chlorine or sulfur dioxide release; and\n    5) Section 5 - a copy of the completed RMP submittal form for submission to EPA.\nAn effective RMP program minimizes risk by promoting a safer and more efficient waste water treatment operation through better process control and preventive maintenance. Also, a well thought out Emergency Response Plan will help reduce the impact of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.\n\nThis RMP program meets the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR part 68, which applies to facilities with certain threshold quantities (TQ) of hazardous chemicals, including chlorine ( TQ  1,500 lbs) and sulfur dioxide (TQ  1,000 lbs). The SDSID North Plant uses chlorine to disinfect waste water. The South Plant uses chlorine to disinfect waste water and sulfur dioxide to reduce the residual chlorine levels in treated water. The North Plant maintains 12,000 lbs (6 one-ton cylinders) of chlorine on-site. The South Plant maintains 12,000 lbs (6 one-ton cylinders) of chlorine and 6,000 lbs (3 one-ton cylinders) of sulfur dioxide on-site and, therefore, both plants are required to have a RMP for these processes.\n\nIt is SDSID's goal to provide a safe and cost effective way for treating wastewater generated by residents and businesses. Present treatment operations at SDSID require the use of chlorine and sulfur "

      "SummaryText": "dioxide. With respect for the potential hazards involved with using these chemicals SDSID has taken many steps to prevent their release.\n\nAccident History\nSince SDSID has been in operation there has not been one significant release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. No SDSID employees have ever been injured by a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. Furthermore, no off-site or public receptors, human or animal, have been injured by an air release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. During the last 40 years of treating wastewater, SDSID has never had a significant chemical accident of any kind. \n\nPrevention Program\nDue to the highly automated and fault tolerant delivery system, the likelihood of even a minor release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is very low. The entire delivery system, beginning at the one-ton cylinders and ending at the chlorine/sulfur dioxide injectors, is maintained under constant vacuum pressure. This system automatically and instantaneously shuts down the flow of chlorine/sulfur dioxide in the event of a fault. The robust one-ton cylinders that chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in and dispensed from undergo rigorous integrity tests and are routinely inspected and reconditioned. These integrity tests and preventive maintenance are performed by the chemical distributor.\n\nNo only are SDSID's chlorination and sulfonation systems engineered to be very fault tolerant, but they are also operated in a safe manner. SDSID is very pro-active in accident prevention and preventive maintenance of their chlorination and sulfonation equipment and associated controls, including: \n        routine upgrades, change-outs and rebuilding of disinfection delivery and storage equipment as recommended by equipment manufacturers, \n        frequent mechanical integrity inspections on equipment and intrinsic and extrinsic safety controls for processes, and \n        frequent inspections from outside contractors and safety advisors to insure that operator training and district operating procedure"

These operators are certified by the state to safely operate the chlorination and sulfonation equipment. \nMoreover, these individuals receive frequent specific training for responding and managing chlorine/sulfur dioxide releases. SDSID operators are equipped and trained for chlorine/sulfur dioxide emergencies and coordinate emergency response activities with the Bountiful City Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes\nSDSID's chlorination and sulfonation systems are engineered to be very fault tolerant and are operated in a safe manner. However, SDSID understands that extreme and unforeseeable events could potentially push these systems beyond what they were designed to withstand. Therefore, as technology changes and different means of disinfection become practical solutions, SDSID will research and implement new equipment and processes to further reduce the hazards associated with the storage of chemicals that may harm district employees, the public or the environment.\n\nCertification Statement\nAs the District Manager of South Davis Sewer Improvement District, I, the undersigned, certify that the following document is SDSID's Risk Management Program and describes our current operations and best efforts for preventing and planning for emergency releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. This program also meets the requirements of EPA's 40 CFR part 68.\n\n____________________________________\nDal Wayment, District Manager - SDSID"
