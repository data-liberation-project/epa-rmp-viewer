      "SummaryText": "The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority(CRMWA) supplies raw water to 11 member cities and uses chlorine to control biological activity in the aqueduct. This is done by injection at the facility.  The facility name is the Amarillo Chlorination Station and is located at HWY 136 & NE 24th Street.  Approximately 8,000 lbs of chlorine in four one ton containers are stored at the site.\n\nIt is CRMWA's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices, and the training of our employees.  CRMWA is very safety conscious regarding chlorine.\n\nThe worst case scenario would occur if a 2,000 lb cylinder were to suddenly rupture.  The vapor cloud would be directed toward a small housing community to the southwest of the building  The building in which the containers are stored would contain the spill long enough to permit evacuation of the affected area.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would occur if a fusible plug or valve should rupture.  The vapor cloud would not reach any populated areas.  \n\nTo prevent accidental releases, CRMWA has implemented an operator training program to minimize the risk of an accidental discharge due to operator error.  The facility also has an inspection schedule to reduce the risk of a discharge due to faulty equipment.\n\nThere have been no chlorine related accidents at the facility within the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program is in the hands of the Potter/Randall County LEPC.  They have an evacuation plan in place.\n\nThe following are planned changes to improve chlorine response safety.\nSend appropriate personnel to training for chlorine operations every second year.\nHave emergency response training for the people who respond to chlorine leak."
