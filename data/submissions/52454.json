This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system This system uses a real time database to track purchase orders, inventory control, work orders, and the Preventative Maintenance program.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Walton Fire Department, the LEPC, and EMS in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods manufactures cottage cheese, sour cream and flavored dips (dairy products). The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is 311513. This facility is capable of producing and packaging various cultured products for consumer intake. Many of the areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products. Some of these areas include: receiving, processing, packaging and storage areas.\n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: i.e., ammonia, at this location. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the various dairy products in the areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989. It is a self-alarming chemical by its"

      "SummaryText": "distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature. It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue. Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns. The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n3.0 Release Scenarios\n\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at Kraft's Walton plant, a release from the ammonia refrigeration system could potentially affect employees on-site and the general public offsite. USEPA requires companies to use models for \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios for each regulated chemical. Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur. If a release occurred, however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.\n\nThe ammonia release scenario was modeled using the EPA's RMP*Comp Software to obtain the distance to ERPG-2 endpoint. The Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2, ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association It refers to the level of ammonia that individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without being subjected to irreversible or other serious health effects that could make it difficult for them to leave the affected area.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it i"

      "SummaryText": "s in compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1. The equipment at ground level is guarded against impact\n\n2. Critical ammonia equipment is installed above the 100 year flood level\n\n3. Most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n4. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures).\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 2004. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response program which includes an assisted emergency response plan for hazardous substance releases. This combination emergency response plan deals with:\n\n- Accidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste into the environment;\n\n- The measures to be taken to prevent an accident;\n\n- Countermeasures to be taken in the event of an emergency; and,\n\n- The procedures for containing and limiting the duration of the emergency measures to be employed for further protection of employees responding to the emergency, as well as other plant personnel.\n\nThis plan also incorporates the SPCC plan, by reference, which includes the location, types and amounts of chemicals stored on-site, notification procedures, and countermeasures to be taken in the event of a spill. It also deals with the planning, training, response and countermeasures to be taken for location personnel who respond to spills and leaks anywhere on site.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to also establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the LEPC and the Walton Fire Department) and company personnel"

Based on the 2006 \"what-if\" PHA completed for ammonia, a list of action items was developed and is being monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished."
