The Positive Train Control (PTC) directive deadline was extended and Infineum, Bayway Chemical Plant is now operating at normal.  Therefore, the RMP is being updated to decrease the maximum on-site inventory of chlorine from the current registration quantity of 3,240,000 lb. to 1,100,000 lb. (approximately 18-90 ton rail cars to 6-90 ton rail cars).  Revised is RMP Section 1.17 to show the decreased on-site inventory of Chlorine for the Process Dispersants, Process ID# 1000062005.  Also revised are RMP Sections 1.14 and 1.15 to provide the most recent information for the Last Safety Inspection (by External Agency).  Also revised is RMP Section 7, Item 7.5, Date of the most recent review of operating procedures for each of the Programs.  Finally, revised is the Executive Summary, paragraph labeled, \"Emergency Response Program\" where another Shift Team Leader is added to those previously listed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were no significant changes to the management system since the last RMP update.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Infineum USA L.P.

Our OIMS are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from our hazard reviews and any incident investigations.\n\n\n\nDuring the reporting year, the BWCP was an American Chemical Council Responsible Care Facility for its effective safety and health management programs.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Infineum BWCP, located in Linden, N. J., operates several processes to produce additives for engine oils and transmission fluids.  While the additive products are not regulated as hazardous by the EPA, some of our starting materials are regulated as flammable or toxic.  Our flammable material is mixed C4 hydrocarbons (Butane and Butenes).  Our regulated toxic materials are: Anhydrous Ammonia, Chlorine, Hydrogen Chloride, and Vinyl Acetate.  In addition we have Hydrogen Sulfide that is a regulated substance under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.  The mixed hydrocarbons listed above are also regulated as a reactive mixture under NJTCPA.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe plant uses OIMS, which covers all aspects of our operations that could affect the safety or health of our employees or public neighbors.  This system was developed by ExxonMobil Chemical Company in 1992.  Although the plant became part of a new company, Infineum, in 1999, OIMS continues to be the formal Operations Integrity System at the BWCP.  In 2006, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) reviewed the practice of the site OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management "

After an extensive review, Lloyd's concluded that the \"design of the environmental components of OIMS has embraced the intent behind ISO 14001 and has addressed all of the individual ISO 14001 system elements\".  They went on to say, \"at the Bayway Chemical Plant, individuals at all levels demonstrated a high level of personal commitment to OIMS implementation.  It is the opinion of Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance that the environmental management components of Infineum's OIMS have addressed all the requirements of ISO 14001:2004\". \n\n\n\nThe OIMS system meets all the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (EPA RMP), OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 119.110, and NJTCPA.  The system also exceeds all regulatory requirements by incorporating periodic management review of performance measurements for each practice to evaluate whether each practice is working as planned and what improvements might be made.  The Infineum BWCP received OSHA VPP STAR status in 1994 and was re-certified in 1997, 2002, and in 2008.  This coveted recognition is given to those plants that go through a rigorous OSHA audit and demonstrate that they both meet and go beyond the regulations.  Infineum withdrew from the program in January, 2013, but has submitted its application to re-enter the program. The Infineum BWCP is also a member of the Chlorine Institute and the American Chemical Council Responsible Care program.\n\n\n\nEach of the EPA RMP areas is described in greater detail below and in the Data Element Section.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, equipment design basis, and equipment configuration information.  Specific groups within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining the information up-to-date.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  In general the PSI is maintained in the unit Process Control Standards.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment including materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  When combined with written procedures and trained personnel, this information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities.  This information is also used in evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Infineum BWCP has a comprehensive program of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).

The process technician training program includes initial classroom and on-the-job training for new hire and newly assigned technicians.  Phase 1 of the program covers orientation and initial process training in a classroom setting.   Phase 2 relies on unit training manuals and provides a combination of classroom and field training.  Phase 3 is on-the-job training with a qualified technician.  Final evaluation of the trainee includes a written test and an oral field walk-through.  Both are conducted by unit supervision.  New hires must complete all three phases of the program while newly assigned process technicians begin their training at Phase 2.  All process technicians are trained to the 24-hr Hazmat technician level. \n\n\n\nProcess Technician refresher training is provided through HSSE Day, unit-specific refresher training, and weekly safety meetings.   HSSE Day serves as the annual Hazmat technician refresher training for process technicians and general safety training, including:  Fire Pad Training Review, Work Permit Review, Energy Isolation, Hearing Conservation, Emergency Response, TCPA, and DPCC Refresher.  Unit-specific Refresher Training covers standard and emergency procedures, simulated emergencies, and a review of the SDS EHS on the unit, and is conducted at least every three years.  Respirator Fit testing, Air Purified Respirator (APR) and SCBA refresher training are done on an annual basis in the field in a separate training session.  All of this training is documented for each process technician, including the means to verify that technician understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nWork performed by contractors at Bayway is managed consistent with and is a part of the overall OIMS.

Contractor administration procedures are developed, coordinated, and implemented by the Plant's Contractor Administration Team (CAT) made up of representatives from Safety, Training, Maintenance, Projects, Operations, Purchasing, and representatives from the contractor's workforce.\n\n\n\nContractor Administration begins with the Contractor Selection Procedure.  The procedure includes an annual qualification of contractors by the CAT that allows specific contractors to be considered for work.  This process includes a review of the Contractor's Safety Program as well as the Contractor's safety performance.  The review team also evaluates the Contractor's past performance in meeting training requirements, the effectiveness of their ongoing program to promote HSE awareness, and general feedback on work performance including input from the Bayway Safety Survey system.\n\n\n\nIt has been the practice at Bayway to use union trained labor where craft skills are required.  Selected Contractors must then have agreements to utilize trained and qualified union labor that have received their craft training in state certified union craft training programs.\n\n\n\nSpecific training for the individual contract worker is accomplished by a twofold approach of Contractor training and Owner Orientation.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor, utilizing information provided by Bayway via the contract exhibit, \"Safety and Health Instructions for Contractors\" and the HSE manual, inform, train, and evaluate each employee.
