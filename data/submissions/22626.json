If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the manufacture and storage of agricultural fertilizers. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one (1) storage tank of 30,000 gallons capacity. The maximum quantity stored would be 127,500 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n\nThe alternate case scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of US OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard, K - 61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21 - Chapter 43 - Rule 43.6(200).\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe"
