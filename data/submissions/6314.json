      "SummaryText": "Southern Family Foods, LLC has a refrigeration system at its food processing facility located in Shannon, Mississippi.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) as a refrigerant in the refrigeration system.  In accordance with federal regulations, the facility has developed and implemented a Risk Management Program including accidental release prevention and emergency response procedures to address onsite and offsite safety issues associated with the use of ammonia at the facility.  In addition, the facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) provisions.\n\nA worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were evaluated to estimate potential impacts to the surrounding offsite area in the event of a release of ammonia from the facility.  Since the refrigeration system equipment is located inside a building, both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios account for passive mitigation based on building ventilation rates.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on failure of the high-pressure receiver and associated equipment when filled to the maximum quantity allowed (18,840 pounds of ammonia).  The released ammonia from a worst-case release event would travel to offsite areas and reach nearby public receptors.  The alternative scenario is based on a release of ammonia from a leaking pump seal associated with a recirculator pump.  In the alternative scenario, the released ammonia would travel to offsite areas and reach nearby public receptors. \n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release of ammonia that caused injuries, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years.  Also, mitigation measures and procedures have been established by Southern Family Foods to minimize the potential for accidental ammonia releases and to minimize offsite impacts in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  These measures include ammonia leak detectors and alarms, required operator training in ammonia safety, a preventiv"
