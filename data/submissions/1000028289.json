These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at the Blackhawk Gas Treating Facility (Blackhawk or Facility) and training of operations personnel and contractors. EagleHawk implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  EagleHawk places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel.  Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, and/or mitigate any off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nBlackhawk Central, located in DeWitt County, Texas, is owned and operated by EagleHawk.  Blackhawk Central is a natural gas processing plant comprised of natural gas liquid recovery, natural gas liquids fractionation, and natural gas treatment and compression equipment.  The natural gas liquid recovery equipment is designed to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  Produced gas and liquids are delivered to the Facility from gathering systems and pipelines.  The Facility process produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate.  The Facility equipment operates to separate, stabilize, treat (as necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate), and transfer gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate to sales.  Natural gas is transported by pipeline from the Facility, and natural gas liquids and "

The process safety information is readily available to all employees and used by Facility personnel, the process hazard analysis team, and persons in charge of updating the emergency response plan.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  EagleHawk maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operations.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nEagleHawk also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment at Blackhawk Central.  This information includes but is not limited to materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nEagleHawk primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of EagleHawk personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and may include third parties.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed.  Any identified risks are promptly addressed.  Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change at the Facility.  Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\n\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nBlackhawk Central maintains written procedures at the Facility that address various modes of process operations such as: (1) initial start-up; (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown;  (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; and (7) startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown.

Changes to process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, changes to the quantity of regulated substances in the process, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Reviews ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate a change.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are notified of changes and, if necessary, trained on the changes.\n\n    \n\n        Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nEagleHawk promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action for the prevention of the same or a similar incident.  Findings and recommendations are documented and are forwarded to Facility management for resolution.\n\n\n\n    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nEagleHawk periodically conducts audits to determine the implementation of the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  An audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until resolution.  The resolution of each finding is documented.  The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n    Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHazards in the process at Bla"

The existing safety features to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances in the Facility are described below.\n\n\n\n        Uniform Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program is applied throughout the RMP-covered process at Blackhawk Central.  These prevention programs are designed and implemented to prevent potential accidental release scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.\n\n\n\n        Specialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nSafety features are incorporated into the design, construction, operation and maintenance of Blackhawk Central to help prevent, quickly detect and control a release, and to reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nRelease Detection \n\n   Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n   Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n   Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n   Automatic shutdown systems for specific process\n\n   Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n   Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n   Total plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n   Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers \n\n   Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures\n\n   Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n    \n\nEagleHawk has an excellent record of accident prevention.  There have been no large or small accidental releases resulting in injuries to site personnel or contractors, or offsite consequences at the Facility. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nEagleHawk maintains written emergency procedures at the Facility to protect worker and public safety and the environment"

Employees are trained on the emergency procedures and the emergency procedures are updated when the process or Facility is modified.  Changes to the emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency program for Blackhawk Central is coordinated with the DeWitt County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Coordination includes periodic meetings to communicate the Facility operations, contact information, and response activities.  EagleHawk has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., DeWitt County LEPC Chairman, DeWitt County Sheriff, and Cuero Fire Department).  The LEPC would assist the Facility, as requested, to notify the public, control traffic, and facilitate response to an incident.  EagleHawk provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated flammable substances in the Facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEagleHawk tracks and resolves all PHA recommendations.  All personnel, employees, and contractors are encouraged to notify their supervisor of any changes or modifications to the Facility that could result in improved safety.  Plans to improve the safety include:  1)  Installation of additional process controls, such as tank gauges and/or alarms; and, 2)  Installation of process area detection systems.\n\n\n\n"
