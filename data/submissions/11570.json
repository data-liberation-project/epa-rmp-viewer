      "SummaryText": "MCB Camp Pendleton (Base) is the United States Marine Corps' largest amphibious assault training facility.  The Base covers an area of approximately 125,000 acres and is populated by over 40,000 military personnel and civilian employees in addition to numerous military dependents.  The Base provides its own water supply and wastewater treatment facilities within its boundaries.  Disinfection is therefore necessary to reduce the potential for transmission of infectious diseases.  Chlorination has long been the accepted and preferred method of disinfection for both water and wastewater in the United States.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure during handling and, to protect the health of persons on MCB Camp Pendleton and in the surrounding communities.\n\n1.1  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAccidental release for the MCB Camp Pendleton systems is dependent on developed chlorine handling procedures, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, and the staff training.  Base facilities have been assessed against the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 55 - Storage, Use and Handling of Compressed and Liquefied Gases in Portable Cylinders, and it is Base policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Chlorine storage building, 22020, is marked Danger Chlorine to reduce unauthorized entry.  The building is locked and surrounded by a security fence with a locked gate.\n\nThe accidental release protection for the chlorine systems also involves a prevention program that includes:\n\n7 Conducting a process hazard analysis\n \n7 Implementing operating procedures\n \n7 Implementing a maintenance program\n \n7 Conducting incident investigation\n \n7 Conducting compliance audits\n\nAn Emergency Response Program has been developed to respond to the worst-case release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "ncy response actions involve the operators and maintenance staff of the systems, the Base Fire Department, and offsite expertise from the San Diego County Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT), when necessary.  In addition, the Assistant Chief of Staff, Environmental Security serves as the focal point for notifying the appropriate agencies and providing information to the public.\n\n1.2  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nChlorine stored in 150-pound cylinders is used for disinfection at both water supply and wastewater treatment facilities.  Building 22020 is a storage facility for these 150-pound cylinders and typically houses 80 cylinders, 40 full and 40 empty.\n\n\n1.3  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nThe U.S. EPA requires MCB Camp Pendleton to conduct an offsite consequence analyses to provide information to the public and government agencies about the potential consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) consists of two elements.\n\n7 Worst-case release scenario\n \n7 Alternative release scenario\n\n1.3.1  Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nU.S. EPA regulations require the evaluation of a worst-case consequence analysis consisting of a release from the largest vessel in the system over a ten minute period under conservative weather conditions.  Therefore, an analysis was made of the entire contents of a 150-pound cylinder releasing at a rate of 15 pounds per minute, under weather conditions prescribed by the U.S. EPA as Class F stability and wind speed of 1.5 meters/second.  These release conditions were evaluated to determine the distance away from the system where a maximum airborne concentration of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) would exist.  This airborne concentration has been determined by the U.S. EPA as the toxic endpoint below which it is believed that nearly all individua"

      "SummaryText": "ls can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) for the worst-case scenario is dependent on the topographic setting (i.e., urban or rural) for the process.  The toxic endpoint distance for Building 22020 is 0.4 miles under an urban setting.  An evaluation of this distance determined that no offsite impacts (i.e., potential impact to public or environmental receptors) are likely to occur during this worst-case release scenario.\n\n1.3.2  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe U.S. EPA regulations require an alternative consequence analysis if the worst-case analysis reveals potential impacts to public or environmental receptors.  Because the worst-case scenario did not reveal any potential impacts to receptors, an alternative release scenario was not required for facility 22020.\n\n1.4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMCB Camp Pendleton has taken steps so that the chlorine systems comply with U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  The buildings containing the systems have been evaluated against National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 55 and the Uniform Building Code (UBC).  At this time, no system or building upgrades for Building 22020 are planned.\n\nAlthough not required by EPA, MCB Camp Pendleton has developed a prevention program that includes:\n\n7 Documenting process safety information regarding the hazards of chlorine and components of the system\n \n7 Conducting a process hazard analysis to evaluate potential mechanical failures or operational causes that could result in an accidental release\n \n7 Implementing operating procedures\n \n7 Implementing a maintenance program\n \n7 Conducting incident investigation\n \n7 Conducting compliance audits\n\n1.5  FIVE-YEAR ACCID"

      "SummaryText": "ENT HISTORY\n\nAccording to information provided by the MCB Camp Pendleton Fire Department and AC/S, Environmental Security, since June 21, 1994, or the date of construction of the system if later, there have been no accidental releases from chlorine storage facility 22020 that resulted in injuries to public receptors, or response or restoration activities at an environmental receptor.\n\n1.6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on the existing management system for responding to emergencies, the appropriate discovery and notification procedures, and coordination with the San Diego County Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT).  The operators and maintenance staff for the Facilities Maintenance Department (FMD) have been trained as Facilities Responders to report accidental releases to the Base Fire Department.  The Base Fire Department subsequently notifies HIRT for emergency response actions.  The AC/S, Environmental Security plays an active role in notifying the appropriate government agencies and communicating releases to the public.\n\n1.7  PLANNED UPGRADES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt this time, no upgrades to building 22020 planned."
