Bulk anhydrous ammonia is\r\nreceived via transport trucks and stored for the eventual sale to farmers. This facility is subject to the\r\nRisk Management Program rule as a Program Level 2 facility. The executive summary is our first\r\nmeans of communicating the risk to the public but also outlining our preventative program to further\r\ndemonstrate we are a safe operator.\r\n\r\nA. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\r\nWe are a non-responding facility. However, we coordinate with the LEPC on an annual basis our\r\ninternal Emergency Action Plan and ensure we are still currently included in the community\r\nemergency response program. Our Emergency Action Plan provides procedures for our employees\r\nto conduct in the event of an uncontrolled release or any other RMP reportable incident.\r\nWe do our best to prevent accidental releases. We have well trained staff, established SOP's, and\r\nactive and passive mitigation measures that act as additional fail-safe design.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled\r\nThis stationary source consists of a bulk tank and multiple nurse tanks of anhydrous ammonia. Exact\r\nquantities are withheld from this executive summary as a means of protection from potential\r\nmalicious acts. The facility does hold in excess of the threshold planning quantity which is subject to\r\nthe RMP rule. The process is very simple. We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck, store\r\nit in a bulk tank and then transfer it to smaller, portable, nurse tanks for farm use and application into\r\nthe soil for crop nutrients.\r\n\r\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur overall Management System is laid out in out Risk Management Program. Overall\r\nimplementation is the responsibility of the General Manager. This facility has developed a worst-case\r\nand alternative release scenario"

Safety information - This information outlines the overall hazards of our regulated substance,\r\nanhydrous ammonia, includes our maximum intended inventory, safe upper & lower operating limits,\r\nprovides equipment specifications, and list any RAGAGEP we have deemed appropriate for our\r\nfacility.\r\n2. Hazard Review - This is a systemic approach used to identify hazards associated with our\r\nprocess that include human error and equipment malfunction, as well as safeguards needed to\r\nprevent that from occurring. It also includes steps needed to detect and monitor releases.\r\n3. Operating Procedures - We have developed specific operating procedures for our facility. Our\r\nemployees have been trained in the appropriate procedures for their prospective duties. These\r\nprocedures include initial start up, normal and temporary operations, normal and emergency\r\nshutdown, startup after a normal or emergency shutdown, equipment inspections and consequences\r\nof deviations and how to correct or avoid those deviations.\r\n4. Training - Our employees are trained at least every 3 years on the respective procedures and\r\nhazards associated with the process.\r\n5. Maintenance - We have established maintenance schedule that is based on RAGAGEP\r\nincluding manufacturer's recommendations when available. In the instances that those are\r\nunavailable, we use prior operating experience. We understand that inspection and maintenance\r\noperators need further training, so we ensure each employee involved in the on-going mechanical\r\nintegrity of the process has been trained in the hazards of the process, how to avoid or correct\r\nunsafe situations, and procedures applicable to the job tasks. When we do utilize contractors at our\r\nanhydrous ammonia facility, we ensure that the contractors are traine"
