The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of ammonia or sulfur dioxide release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of minor ammonia releases.  The Fire Department will be used to respond to any non-minor leaks or leaks that cannot be repaired.  We have trained Emergency Coordinators\u00bf In the event of a non-minor leak; we will evacuate and take initial life safety precautions.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the studies conducted during preparation of this RMP, the following adjustments are planned to ensure continued safe operations:"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management of Franzia Winery Tulare is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Environmental Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Franzia Winery Tulare employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Franzia Winery Tulare facility covered by this RMP is located at 1887 N. Mooney Blvd. in Tulare, California.  The facility produces grape juice which is fermented into wine.   The facility uses sulfur dioxide for bacterial control and anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration.\n\nThree stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems are used for chilling wine.  System A has eight chillers, System B has two chillers and System C has one chiller.  The potential total anhydrous ammonia charge in System A is 30,000 pounds.  System B has a potential total anhydrous ammonia charge to the system of 6,000 pounds.  System C has a potential total anhydrous ammonia charge to the system of 2,600 pounds. \n\nThe sulfur dioxide system is located on the east sided of the winery.  The sulfur dioxide in the 1-ton cylinder serves as a supply to fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinders ranging from 6-pound to 100-pound cylinders.  The sulfur dioxide is injected from the smaller cylinders into the wine to control the bacteria.  This system includes one filling station contain 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, with up to 6,000 pounds (three cylinders) in storage.  This area is considered a single process totaling 8,000 pounds.  \nThe site includes an office/lab building; a c"

Refrigeration equipment and piping are located outdoors.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia and sulfur dioxide releases at The Wine Group\u00bfs Franzia Winery Tulare facility is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system and sulfur dioxide system design and construction (i.e. double-block scenario relief valves, ASME cylinders), the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \nThis includes:\n\u00bf\tCompliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification;\n\u00bf\tPerformance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information; \n\u00bf\tImplementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA; \n\u00bf\tAppropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel;  \n\u00bf\tPerformance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs;\n\u00bf\tApplication of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols; and\n\u00bf\tUse of qualified contractors for work on the system.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nBetween June 1999 and the present, there have reportedly been no ammonia or sulfur dioxide releases resulting in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or in off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  It is noted that a near miss incident of a condensor fan blade failure in September 2004 had a potential for a release.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nFranzia Winery Tulare has developed a Hazardous Material Management Plan (HMMP) d"
