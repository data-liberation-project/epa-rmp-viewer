Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor and the fire department (Santa Barbara County Fire Department, 805-934-6292) for assistance as necessary.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis has been performed on the ammonia refrigeration systems, and this study has resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Bonita Packing Co. has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nBonita Packing Co. has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the OES CalARP regulation.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tInvestigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; and\r\n\u00bf\tAudit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations. \r\n\r\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nBonita Packing Co. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\nBonita Packing Co. is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Only trained operators and the refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations.  Bonita Packing Co. has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nBonita Packing Co. is located at 1850 W Stowell Road in Santa Maria, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's two refrigeration systems to provide cooling for the processing and storage of vegetables.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSystem #1 uses a maximum of 32,000 pounds of ammonia.  \r\n\u00bf\tSystem #2 uses a maximum of 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  \r\n\r\nThe high stage compressors compress dry gas taken from the accumulator/recirculator vessels, gaining heat through work, then discharge the hot gas to the condensers.  Within the condensers, the high-pressure vapor cools and changes back to a high-pressure liquid (referred to as condenser drain or CD).  The high pressure liquid drains from the evaporative condensers and drains to the high pressure receiver (HPR).  Liquid from the high pressure receiver feeds liquid ammonia to the recirculators, evaporators, ice makers, and heat exchangers.  Dry vapor from the accumulator vessels is transferred via the high temperature suction header to the compressors where the cycle starts again."
