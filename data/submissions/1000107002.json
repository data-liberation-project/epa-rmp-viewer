LPG is received from railcars, offloaded using portable transloaders, and loaded onto transports for distribution to customers. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading Process (Program Level III) including storage of up to 16 butane railcars and approximately 2 transloading units. The facility includes propane operations as well, however these operations fall under the exclusion for retail facilities identified in 40 CFR Part 68.126.\n\nThis Facility complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). This process is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\nThis is an RMP for a newly covered Facility and therefore, the Facility has never had an accident involving butane which resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\n\nThis Facility maintains an emergency plan meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38. Operators and facility personnel receive initial training in the provisions of this plan and refresher training periodically. In addition, this plan is shared with the local responding agencies and coordination activities occur annually. For the purposes of emergency response, this Facility is considered a non-responding facility and personnel do not conduct offensive emergency response actions. In the event of an emergency involving the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading Process, it is the policy of the facility to activate the emergency shutdown system, e"
