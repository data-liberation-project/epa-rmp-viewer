The regulated substance under the RMP rule is Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7). Anhydrous Ammonia is used exclusively as a refrigerant for cooling purposes in both production and storage areas. There are two separate refrigeration systems on site, operating independent of one another. Both systems are a closed loop with normal operating pressures of less than 200 PSI. The North Plant system (process) has a maximum charge of 13,687 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The South Plant system (process) has a maximum charge of 14,707 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The remaining 1,400 lbs are stored outdoors in ten 140 lb D.O.T. certified blue cylinders. These cylinders are in a locked steel mesh cage.\nQuantity: Maximum quantities on-site for the regulated substance are\nAmmonia (Anhydrous) 29,794 lbs.\nToxic Worse Case Scenario\nWhen doing our toxic worst case scenario we considered the possibility of the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) losing all the ammonia stored in it. The high pressure receiver normal inventory is approx  5000 lbs of ammonia. In the event that we released all the ammonia stored in the HPR due to a relief valve releasing we considered all sources to the toxic endpoint. This included environmental receptors as well as public.\nToxic Alternate case\nWhen computing our toxic alternate case we considered a more probable release than the worst case scenario. The release study included all public and environmental receptors that would be affected.\nFlammable Worst Case\nAnhydrous Ammonia is not considered a flammable substance unless Lower Explosive Limit (LEL)  & Upper Explosive Limits (UEL) are met. We have ammonia detection systems that automatically turns on exhaust fans in the engine rooms as well as several production areas. Most of the plant also has sprinkler systems through out for fire suppression.\nAccidental Re"

The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency.  ConAgra Foods Packaged Foods LLC. has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date. The Dunn County LEPC reviewed the site plan on April 28 of 2009.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: ConAgra Foods Packaged Foods LLC.  have complied with the EPA Risk Management Program and also the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations CFR 1910.119 & 1910.120 to assure that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is well maintained and employees are properly trained and periodically retrained to assure they are kept up to date on any changes and new operations that may affect them.  The ammonia compressors automatically shut down if the pressure exceeds 200 PSI. The relief valves are preset at 250 PSI where applicable.
