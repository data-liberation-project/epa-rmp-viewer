Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\nThe Baton Rouge North Wastewater Treatment Plant (NWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\nThe NWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the north side of the City's urban perimeter including the Southern University campus, and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine.  The use of chlorine micals makes the NWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nChlorine.  The NWWTP has two 5,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank's working capacity is limited, by means of administrative controls, to a maximum of approximately 4,000 gallons, or no more than 50,000 lb. of liquid chlorine.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  The NWWTP no longer uses sulfur dioxide.  By closely monitoring the chlorination system and the chlorine dosage, the plant was able to reduce the residual chlorine in the treated effl"

As a result, the dechlorination system was removed from service and the NWWTP no longer maintains any sulfur dioxide inventory on site. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 includes, among other items, the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of the regulated toxic substance (chlorine). Originally, these requirements also called for the Executive Summary (ES) to include a discussion of the WSC and ARS for each toxic chemical.\n\nPer the above, the ES of the original RMP submitted to the USEPA in 1999 presented and discussed these scenarios and the hypothetical offsite consequences in some detail.  Considering that the operation of the chlorination system has not undergone any changes that would affect the scenarios or their underlying assumptions, these scenarios are still valid.  However, they will not be discussed further here.  In accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18837, April 9, 2004), a discussion of the WCS's and ARS's is no longer required for inclusion in the ES.\n\nThe WCS and ARS for sulfur dioxide no longer apply, since this chemical is no longer present in the process.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n1.0    Safety Information\n\nThe North Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine but sodium hydroxide solution - caustic - as well, even though this is not an RMP-regulated chemical); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\n"

They show material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n2.0     Hazard Review\n\nA detailed review of the hazards (Process Hazard Assessment, or PHA) associated with the operation of the chlorination system at the NWWTP was just performed within the last few days.  The Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was used to identify any hazards and ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.  The same HAZOP technique was used in the two previous PHA's, which were performed in 1999 and 2004, respectively.\n\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments conducted the HAZOP review and the report that will present and discuss the \"Action Items (AI's)\" is currently being prepared.  Upon completion, this report will be submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action(s) identified for each action item and their proposed disposition (if known), will be discussed in said report.\n\n3.0     Operating Procedures\n\nThe NWWTP keeps on site copies of all operating and maintenance procedures that were prepared and submitted to the city by the plant design firm.  These procedures address not only normal plant operations but other operating modes such as start-up, normal shut-down, emergency shut-downs, start-up following emergency shut-downs, etc.  These procedures also address the remov"

As a part of this training, the employees were given written tests to verify their understanding of the process, the operating conditions, the hazards inherent in the materials being handled and the appropriate responses to alarm conditions and emergencies.  \n\nAny time that the process undergoes modifications, changes or improvements, all operators affected by such changes will be provided with the necessary training.

These audits determine how effectively the policies and procedures of the RMP have been implemented.  The audit findings are submitted to management for resolution and corrective action as necessary and applicable.  Documentation of the audits, findings and resolutions are maintained as part of the prevention program.\n\nThe last compliance audit was performed in September of 2006.  The audit team included members of the operation, maintenance and management staffs of the wastewater treatment department.\n\n7.0    Incident Investigation\n\nThe NWWTP has established procedures to promptly investigate all incidents which result, or could reasonably have resulted, in a significant release of the regulated chemical or which could cause personnel injuries and/or significant property damage.  The objectives of such investigations are:\n\n* to establish the facts relating to the incident, \n* to determine the factors causing or contributing, directly or indirectly, to the incident and\n* to define what corrective actions, if any, are necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nThe incident investigation team includes members of the staff who are familiar with the process involved in the incident and also includes personnel from the operations, maintenance and management departments.\n\nThe investigating team submits its findings and recommendations to plant management for resolution.

These changes have virtually eliminated all pressurized liquid chemical lines from the system (with the sole exception of the liquid chlorine unloading line, which is full of liquid chlorine only while a chlorine truckload is being unloaded into the storage tank), as well as allowed the removal of the entire sulfur dioxide system from the process.\n\nThere are no other safety-related changes system anticipated for the chlorination at the NWWTP in the near future.\n\n                                       Page 1 of 6 \n\n"
