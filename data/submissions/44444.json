This standard is intended only for the management of highly hazardous chemicals.  However, Cedar Bayou has applied its programs and policies to the entire plant, regardless of the degree of hazard.  Specific programs include:  \n(1)    A detailed hazard assessment conducted on all processes to ensure they have been designed safely,\n(2)    An intensive equipment inspection program to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases,\n(3)    A work permit system to ensure that all work on process equipment is conducted in a safe manner,\n(4)    A Management of Change system to ensure that any change is thoroughly reviewed prior to being implemented,\n(5)    A training program to ensure that all personnel are well trained in the duties of their jobs,\n(6)    An operating procedure system to ensure that approved procedures cover all aspects of the process unit operaton.\nThe Cedar Bayou plant became an OSHA STAR Worksite in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in 1997.  This voluntary program is a partnership between OSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs.  STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition OSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.",

The Cedar Bayou Plant is located on the North side of Interstate 10 between Cedar Bayou and Sjolander, and is situated on approximately 1000 acres.  The plant was initially built by Gulf Oil and began operating in 1963. In 1984, it became part of Chevron through the Chevron-Gulf merger, and is currently part of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, as the result of a joint venture.\n\nThe basic business of Cedar Bayou is to produce simple olefins, mostly ethylene and propylene, and derivatives which include polyethylene resins, normal alpha olefins, and polyalphaolefins.  These products are primarily \"intermediates\" which are processed further by our customers to produce finished consumer products.  End uses for our products include: plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubes and hydraulic fluids, and waxes.  Specific RMP chemicals include: Flammable mixtures, Boron Trifluoride, Aqueous Ammonia and Titanium Tetrachloride.\n\nELABORATION ON ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nThe processes at Cedar Bayou comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

Chemical specific preventions for Titanium Tetrachloride toxic OCA's might include:  An operator is in attendance during the entire Titanium Tetrachloride unloading oprocess and can isolate the system.  Also the catalyst supervisor audits the unloading process.  As a extra level of protection, the unloading hoses are designed for a higher pressure service.  These stainless steel braided hoses are also supported to prevent unnecessary binding or crimping.  They are left hooked up under nitrogen pressure to prevent moisture from degrading the hose integrity.

With the ammonia tank being filled by an overhead line with a dip tube into the vessel, any unloading hose problem would not result in tank leakage, and only the truck would need to be isolated; manual alarm on unit to notify personnel in the immediate area of the release.      \n\nELABORATION ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nALARM SYSTEMS:  Cedar Bayou has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  In addition, the Baytown alarm system can be activated in the event of incidents with potential offsite consequences.\nTRAINED EMERGENCY RESPONDERS:  To protect our people and property, Cedar Bayou has fully trained responders consisting of volunteer employees covering all four rotating shifts to ensure 24-hr coverage. Each shift has a Fire & Safety Specialist, 10 Fire Brigade members, and 3 Emergency Medical Service / Rescue members.  ERT members receive training in all recognized categories of response (Fire, Haz-Mat, Emergency Medical Treatment, Rescue, and Environmental Protection).  One recent accomplishment of our ERT was their winning their fourth consecuative championship title in the International Rescue & Emergency Care Association (IRECA) competition.\nCOMMUNICATIONS LINK TO OFFSITE RESPONDERS:\nThe Cedar Bayou Emergency Command Center (ECC) is our link for internal and external responders. The ECC is staffed by Environmental, Health & Safety personnel, as well as individuals who are on-call.  City of Baytown emergency assistance would be through 911.

On 3/1/2002, a rupture disc in a polyethylene process became fatigued to 70% tolerance of the intended set pressure.  It perforated below the intended set pressure and released approximately 4,700 lbs of polyethylene flake, containing mostly ethylene, to the atmosphere and the area adjacent to the unit.   This necessitated a cleanup, mostly for aesthetic purposes.  Vacuum trucks were used for the cleanup, and one neighbor's driveway was allegedly cracked from the weight of one truck.  The cost of cleanup and good neighbor settlements amounted to approximately $79,500.  BORON TRIFLOURIDE, TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE, AQUEOUS AMMONIA:  There have been no releases of Boron Triflouride, Titanium Tetrachloride, or Aqueous Ammonia at the Cedar Bayou plant in the past five years that have had an adverse impact on the community or that meets the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements with respect to on-site injuries or damage."
