Anhydrous Ammonia is used to provide cooling for the process in these areas.  It is our policy to have programs in \nplace dealing with safety precautions in handling this substance and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia  combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based on the IIAR's \"Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration.\" The plan has been provided and reviewed with the Sampson County Local Emergency Planner Center.  Coordination with the LEPC has been made to notify them through the emergency response plan to respond to incidents that may affect the public.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nPremium Standard Farms, Inc's manufacturing facility is in the business of processing hog meats for the food industry. These products require cooling of the materials during and after being processed. Anhydrous Ammonia is used at this site for this purpose.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant used for the cooling process due to the low cost of the medium and the low temperatures that must be obtained.  The ammonia is enclosed within a closed loop that removes \nheat from the products and storage rooms. The ammonia is evaporated by removing heat from the products and cooling areas at low temperatures and pressures and then dispenses the heat at high pressures and temperatures to outside air.\n\nThe ammonia system at the Pr"

Liquid ammonia vaporizes to a poisonous gas cloud.\n\nAmmonia is a severe irritant of the eyes.  It penetrates the eyes more readily than any other alkali.  Contact with liquid anhydrous ammonia and concentrated solutions can produce severe eye injury or blindness.  \nExposure of the eyes to high gas concentrations can cause temporary blindness and severe eye damage.  Laceration or watering of the eyes can occur upon exposure to 150 ppm ammonia gas and higher.\n\nAmmonia is an irritant by inhalation.  At increasing concentrations it can cause symptoms ranging from runny nose, coughing, chest pain, trouble with breathing, and death.  It can cause severe breathing difficulties that are delayed in onset.  Inhalation of concentrations of 2,500 to 6,500 ppm causes \nshortness of breath, bronchospasm, chest pain, and pulmonary edema (filling of the lungs with fluid) that may be fatal.\n\nExposure of the skin to liquid anhydrous ammonia or high concentrations of the gas can cause first and second degree burns of the skin.  Vapor concentrations of 10,000 ppm are mildly irritating to moist skin, while 30,000 ppm or greater causes a stinging sensation and can produce skin burns and blisters.  These high concentrations of ammonia are corrosive to moist skin and other moist body tissues.\n\nPhysical Hazards\n\nAmmonia or ammonia with oil or other debris is an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or fire.  The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is 16% and Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) is 25% by volume in air.  Elevated temperatures can cause containers of the substance to explode.  Ammonia emits toxic fumes when exposed to heat. When heated to temperatures above 850?F, ammonia will emit hydrogen gas.  The auto ignition temperature is 1204?F if catalyzed by iron.\n\nAmmonia can react to"

It can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with strong oxidizers, hypochlorite bleaches, silver compounds, mercury compounds, gold, other metals, and acids.\n\nCommon Exposure Control Methods\no Process enclosure\no Local exhaust ventilation\no General dilution ventilation\no Personal protective equipment\no Use of water\no Area monitoring (with alarm systems)\n\nPotential for Exposure to Ammonia\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed system with no purposeful exposure to ammonia.  As a closed system, exposure potentials are primarily related to equipment failure, fugitive emissions from improperly adjusted or worn valve packings, pump and compressor seals and pipe connector gaskets, or mistakes in operation of the system. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Lundy Packing Company is the release of 45,000 pounds of ammonia from the system's largest vessel, the high pressure receiver, in a 10 minute period.  The toxic endpoint was determined by using the Aloha computer model.  With a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and a Stability Class of F in an urban topography the endpoint of the spill was determined to be 3.4  miles from the receiver.  \nThe plant site is located in the suburb of the city of Clinton, North Carolina. The public receptors within a radius of 3.4 miles from the plant site are schools, residents, hospital, public parks and downtown office buildings with a population of 5800.\n\nALTERNATE CASE  SCENARIO \n\nAlternate case scenarios for the Lundy Packing Company was reviewed by the maintenance and operating sections.  Considerations were given to the most probable cause of a leak within the system.  The possible leak scenarios considered were:\no Transfer hose rupture\no Process piping failure\no Process vessel or pump releases from seals, drains, bleeds\no Rupture of a sightglass\no Overpressure and release through relief valves\n\nAfter discussing these "

      "SummaryText": "and the operations of the refrigeration system, it was decided that the rupture of a high pressure receiver was the most probable cause of a leak within the system.  Calculations were made considering the leakage of high pressure ammonia liquid from the high pressure receiver sightglass.  The breakage would create a 0.5\" orifice in the sightglass.  At the system pressures, it was determined that a release rate of 391 lbs/min would be released for13 minutes if this incident occurred.  Wind speeds of 3.0 m/sec and a stability class of D were used.  The toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.45 miles by using the Aloha computer modeling program.  This was based on releasing 4,679 pounds of liquid ammonia.\n\nThe public receptors in this area would include residents and public recreational areas. The population of this area would be 135.  There were no active or passive mitigation credits for this scenario.\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nLundy Packing Company/Premium Standard Farms started recording ammonia leaks in January 1997. Since that time there have been nine leaks that resulted in over 100 pound releases. There has been only one release over 100 pounds since 1999.  The leaks resulted from relief valve openings, a pump shaft seal failure, a pin hole in a piping line, and a float chamber failure.  These incidents did not result in injuries, deaths or damage to properties either on site or to the community and the community was not evacuated.  \nFormalized incident investigations were not initiated until 1998.  Therefore detailed information concerning these incidents are not available.  OSHA's PSM program has been implemented and Incident Investigations have been conducted in 1998.  From these investigations, maintenance procedures and equipment inspections have been revised to provide more reliable equipment.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nHistorically, exposures to ammonia most often occur from:\no Leaking valve stem packing glands while opening or closing a va"

The site maintains it's own HAZMAT teams.  Training for these functions is given annually per state requirements.
