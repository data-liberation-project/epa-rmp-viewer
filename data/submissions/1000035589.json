      "SummaryText": "Perma-Fix of South Georgia Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\r\n\r\nPerma-Fix of South Georgia has a Contingency Plan to cover fire, explosion, accidental release of hazardous materials and other emergencies.  The plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed. Personnel are trained to respond to releases through containment and control procedures.  While personal safety is the top priority, preventing release of hazardous materials from the facility is the focus of response procedures. Accidental releases are prevented through a daily inspection program to ensure individual container integrity.  Contents of damaged or leaking containers are immediately repackaged into viable containers. Individual containers and tankers are kept inside secondary containment during storage and transfer and in preparation for transportation.  This ensures that any leaks, spills or releases are limited in impact.\r\n\r\nThe facility stores large volumes of chloroform. In the past five years there have not been any releases or accidents involving the material. A minor leak was discovered in one container during a daily inspection in 2012, and it was immediately repackaged.\r\n\r\nPerma-Fix operates under a quality assurance plan to promote continuous process and safety improvements.  Any incidents are reported and investigated.  Root cause analysis is employed to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence."
