June 07,2004                         This plant was new in July 1997, it is 200,000 sq.ft. designed for the processing and freezing of vegetables. The harvest of green peas takes place each year during July and August, during the remainder of the year frozen vegetables are held in cold storage  then packaged as required.                                                                                                                                                   The ammonia refrigeration system was also new in 1997 and is considered as \"state of the art\". The refrigerant is Anhydrous ammonia of which 36,00 lbs. is kept in two receivers on site.Per the Uniform Mechanical Code our Refrigeration spaces are monitored by Ammonia Detection Systems which include audio and visual alarms,central station monitoring and automatic exhaust systems interlocked to shunt trip breakers for explosion protection. A 15,00 gallon water tank is piped to all relief valves in the system. In the event of an over pressure condition or a relief valve failure, ammonia gas release would be contained and dilluted within the water tank.                                                                                                                                                Our operation staff consist of three licensed engineers whose duties include operation and maintenance of the refrigeration  and boiler equipment. Engineers use the following emergency response equipment;  radios,SCBA's,cannister masks,level C suits and gas monitors.
