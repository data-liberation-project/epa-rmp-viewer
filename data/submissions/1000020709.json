Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the facility to provide cooling for perishable\nand frozen product. The facility has been in operation since 1996 and has been covered under the OSHA PSM\nstandard since March of 1999. Our PSM plan has been updated since to help us maintain a safe and reliable\nrefrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration system at SYSCO East is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range \nbetween a low side of 0psi to a high side of 160 psi. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one\ntime is estimated at 26,500 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worst-case release is the failure of the largest vessel in our refrigeration system. This vessel is called the \n+18 Suction Accumulator that has a maximum capacity of 8,800 pounds. In calculating the area affected by this\nfailure, the engine room enclosure, where the Accumulator is located, will provide passive mitigation, thereby\nreducing the toxic endpoint. The engine room has a volume of 32,000 cubic feet where wall and roof ventilation\nproduce 40 air exchanges per hour. Using the tables and equations found in the EPA's \"RMP Guidance for \nAmmonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 1.30 miles. Based on census data, within this\nradius is a population of 450, a daycare center, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. There\nare no schools or hospitals located within this area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nThe alternative release toxic end point was also determined using the EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", \nreference tables and equations. A pressure release valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release.\nUsing the tables provided in the RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammonia at 130 pounds per minute, \nfrom the High Pressu"

Initial training under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER for all new members of the team..\nSYSCO East also conducts annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic\nspill drills and plpant wide evacuation drills to assure that all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. \nWe also coordinate efforts with Washington County Emergency Management, Washington County HAZMAT Team \nand the Jackson Fire Department, to establish a jointresponse program. The established plan and proceedures\nare periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nWe have trained refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel trained HAZWOPER, \n29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency\nresponse to initiate. This could be by tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down.\nIncluded in the plan are proceedures for emergency shut down and isolation in the event of a release. Our equipment\nincludes but is not limited to: Level A Chemical Suites, SCBA's and back up tanks, and other appropriate \nequipment to support the in-house HAZMAT Team. The team will coordinate their efforts with outside emergency\nservices, as needed, to assure safety.\n\nFive Year Accidnet History:\nThere have been no accidential releases over the reportable threshold in the past five years. \n\nGeneral Accidential Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nSYSCO East continues to comply with the EPA Risk Management Program as well as the OS"
