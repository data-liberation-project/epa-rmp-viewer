      "SummaryText": "The Throop Wastewater Treatment Plant is owned and operated by the Lackawanna River Basin Sewer Authority (LRBSA).  The chlorine process, used for effluent disinfection, is the plant's only process that is subject to the EPA Part 68 RMP Regulations.\n\nThe worst-case scenario identified in the Hazard Assesment for the chlorine process is the release of the entire contents of one ton container in 10 minutes, as required by EPA CFR 40 Part 68.25 regulations.  According to Exhibit 4-4 in the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the down wind distance to the toxic endpoint (concentration of 3 ppm) for this scenario for an urban area is 1.3 miles.  \n\nFor the alternative release scenario, a liquid chlorine release through a 0.344\" diameter vessel hole (fusible plug failure) was selected.  According to Exhibit 4-12 in the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the down wind distance to the toxic endpoint (concentration of 3 ppm) for this scenario is 0.3 miles.\n\nThe LRBSA's policy is to operate a well maintained and safe chlorine process.  Operators are trained and experienced in operating the chlorine process.  LRBSA's policy is also to utilize off-site responders for an emergency response event, if necessary.\n\nThe Authority is in the process of implementing conversion of the chlorine gas feed system to a liquid sodium hypochlorite feed system.  It is anticipated that the conversion will be completed by 12/01/2000.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases from the Throop Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorine process to date."
