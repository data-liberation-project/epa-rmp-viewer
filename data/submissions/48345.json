(SunWest), owns and operates a cold storage facility (Facility) as part of its fruit processing operations in Parlier, Fresno County, California.  The Facility uses anhydrous ammonia as the working fluid in two separately-piped refrigeration systems.  SunWest has implemented a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program to meet the requirements of Title 19, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).  CalARP is California?s version of the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) required under regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR], Part 68). \n \nBased on the regulatory requirements and Facility operations, a Program Level 3 Prevention Program has been prepared for Facility operations.  The Facility stores ammonia in its refrigeration equipment.  The estimated maximum volume of ammonia is regulated under the RMP and CalARP regulations. \n \nThis CalARP includes a review of potential hazards associated with the regulated substance, operational procedures, maintenance procedures, and employee Training.  SunWest has prepared an Emergency Response Plan that coordinates the actions of Facility staff with local emergency responders.  This information has been provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee and to local emergency response agencies.\n\nAs required under the CalARP regulations, Geomatrix Consultants, Inc. (Geomatrix), and SunWest have evaluated worst-case release scenarios using parameters described in 19 CCR 2750.3.  An alternative release scenario was evaluated using parameters described in 19 CCR 2750.4.  The toxic endpoint concentration (TE) for ammonia from the CalARP regulations was used for this evaluation.\n\nSunWest reports that one accidental release of ammonia occurred at the Facility in the past five years, on July 6, 2004.  The release was triggered by a pressure relief valve malfunction.  The equipment has since b"

      "SummaryText": "een repaired and the relief valve outlet has been piped to a water-filled diffusion tank to prevent a release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  As a further precaution, SunWest has piped the outlets of all pressure relief valves in both the north and south compressor rooms to separate water-filled diffusion tanks.\n\nAs a result of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and reviews conducted at the Facility, SunWest plans the following activities to improve safety:\n\n -  Procure a portable ammonia detector to ensure worker safety if an emergency shutdown is required due to a release where ammonia odor was present in the vicinity of controls needed for the shutdown.\n-  Use mechanical integrity checklists to document regular equipment inspections\n-  Test or calibrate all ammonia sensors\n-  Label valves used for emergency shutdowns.\n-  Document content and completion of in house training for non-supervisory refrigeration personnel.\n -  Protect liquid level gauges on North compressor room receiver from accidental damage.\n\nThis report is based on information provided by SunWest, their refrigeration system maintenance contractor, B&W Refrigeration (B&W) of Fresno, California, their electrical contractor, W&E Electric of Orosi, California (W&E), and on information obtained by Geomatrix during visits to the Facility.  For purposes of this report, Geomatrix has assumed that the information provided is accurate, representative, and suitable as the basis for preparing the report."
