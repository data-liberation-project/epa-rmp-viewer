ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nIt is Hancock Foods' policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local laws.  The ammonia refrigeration process at Hancock Foods (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPAA's Accidental Release Prevention rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. Hancock Foods has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of compressed ammonia systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule.  \r\n\r\nThrough its Emergency Response Plan as required under OSHA-PSM, Hancock Foods has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\r\n\r\n2. FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nHancock Foods is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the blast freezing of freshly harvested blueberries.  The berries are then stored in a cold storage freezer.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia within three separate systems: \r\n- Cold Storage Ammonia Refrigeration System: 7,000 pounds (Max. intended inventory)\r\n- Flow Freeze Ammonia Refrigeration System: 3,000 pounds (Max. intended inventory) \r\n- York Tunnel Ammonia Refrigeration System: 9,000 pounds (Max. intended inventory)\r\n\r\nTwo of the systems are co-located (Cold Storage and Flow Freeze), with compressor equipment, low pressure receivers, high pressure receivers (outdoor), and intercoolers located in the same area of the facility.  The York Tunnel system is isolated from the two other systems because it is located in a separate area of the facility.\r\n\r\nThe ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As Hancock Foods' co-located anhydrous ammonia storage capacity could exceed this thresh"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nHancock Foods will conduct a prevention program compliance audit in conjunction with the 5-year revision and resubmittal of its Risk Management Plan.  Findings that are identified as a result of this compliance audit will be promptly addressed to determine and document an appropriate corrective actions for each of the findings as required by the regulations."

The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at Hancock Foods are the only processes that store a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\r\n\r\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\r\n\r\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards Institute /American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) guidance, and American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) guidance as documented in Hancock Foods' PSM Plan.  Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications (PHA) is at least once every five years.\r\n\r\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of Hancock Foods' daily operations.  PM is performed on a regular schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at six locations (engine room and freezers one through five) and are tested several times a year.  Relief valves are replaced, inspected, repaired, tested and/or sealed on a five-year schedule.  Differential pressure gages are replaced immediately upon discovery of any damage that may breach the integrity of the compressed ammonia process.\r\n\r\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWithin the last five years, Hancock Foods has had only one accident involving compressed ammonia.  No deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, offsite evacuations or sheltering-in-place occurred during this event.  On August 9, 2012, an estimated 80 to 90 pounds of ammonia was released from the cold storage condenser relief valve.  Motor control to the condensing unit fans was lost and buil"

The plant was shut down and evacuated.    \r\n\r\nAn incident investigation was conducted in association with the August, 2012 release.  As part of the investigation, the motor control VFD was bypassed and directly wired to rule out any issues with the motor control.  The motor control functioned properly and was not the root cause of the incident but a contributing factor.  It was determined that the high pressure safety switch malfunctioned and led to the high pressure situation.  A diagnostic evaluation was not conducted on the safety switch to determine why it malfunctioned.  Instead, a new safety switch was installed and tested.  \r\n\r\n5. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nHancock Foods has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Plan which governs our actions in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release.  A process release would be detected by ammonia sensors installed in 2013 located in the engine room and freezers one through five.  A process release could also be detected by the employees through odor.  High and low liquid alarms are present on the ammonia storage tanks.  The fire alarm and H2O suppression system are tested/checked quarterly by ADT and Maine Fire.  The ammonia sensors remain tested on an annual basis (PSM recommendation to do annually, not every six months as has occurred).  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound and light throughout the facility, and the exhaust system would be activated automatically. \r\n\r\nIn the event of a process release, ADT calls the facility (maintenance department), which would in turn contact the Ellsworth Fire Department if any of the following conditions are present:\r\n\r\n- Upon investigating the incident, Hancock Foods determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance;\r\n- Reportable quantities of ammonia are released; or\r\n- A potential for fire exists (in this case, ADT d"
