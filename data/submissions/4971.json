THE FACILITY OPERATES AN AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM AS PART OF THE PROCESS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS THE RMP CHEMICAL OF CONCERN.  H&M FOOD SYSTEMS HAS BEEN AT THIS LOCATION SINCE 1983.  THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM IS APPROXIMATELY 60,000 POUNDS.  THE FACILITY HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT.  THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM IS DESIGNED AND INSTALLED AND OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS OF THE AMERICAN SOCITY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS (ASME), THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE (ANSI), THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AMMONIA REFRIGERATION (IIAR), THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGINEERS, INC. (ASHRAE), AND THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA).  QUALIFIED OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS ARE USED FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAJOR REPAIRS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM IS CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED AND INSPECTED BY TECHNICIANS THAT ARE TRAINED, QUALIFIED, AND EXPERIENCED IN AMMONIA REFRIGERATION.  TECHNICIANS ARE QUALIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE REFRIGERATION ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS ASSOCIATION (RETA). H&M FOOD SYSTEMS AND THE REFRIGERATION STAFF ARE ALL CURRENT MEMBERS OF RETA.  THE SYSTEM IS INSPECTED PERIODICALLY FOR PROPER OPERATON 24 HOURS PER DAY.  WALKING INSPECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED ON INTERVALS NOT LONGER THAN 4 HOURS.  SYSTEM PARAMETERS ARE LOGGED IN A PERMANENT RECORD, AS ARE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.  THE SYSTEM IS EQUIPPED WITH A SERIES OF REDUNDANT FAILSAFE DEVICES, SENSORS, AND OVERRIDES.  IN THE EVENT A MALFUNCTION OCCURS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN AMMONIA RELEASE, THESE PROTECTIVE DEVICES SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN.  THE SYSTEM CAN NOT BE RESTARTED UNTIL THE CAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN IS IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED.  IN ADDITION TO OPERATIONAL TRAINING, DESIGNATED TECHNICIANS AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL ON EACH SHIFT HAVE BEEN TRAINED"

A MINIMUM OF TWO (2) INCIDENT COMMANDERS ARE ONSITE AT ALL TIMES.  REFRIGERATION TECHNICIANS AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS ARE ALSO TRAINED TO RESPOND TO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF AMMONIA FROM THE SYSTEM.  H&M FOOD SYSTEMS HAS EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES ON-HAND TO PERMIT TRAINED EMPLOYEES TO AGGRESSIVELY LOCATE AND CONTROL A RELEASE, SHOULD IT OCCUR.  THE FACILITY CONDUCTS A FULL INCIDENT RESPONSE DRILL AND EXERCISE EVERY YEAR.  THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED A PROCESS SAFETY MANGEMENT PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE OSHA REGULATIONS (29 CFR 1910.119).  THIS PLAN IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND UPDATED AS NECESSARY.  ALL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM ARE REVIEWED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PSM/RMP MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE PROVISIONS IN THE FACILITY'S PLAN.  THE EPA REQUIRES THE FACILITY TO MODEL THE POTENTIAL OFFSITE IMPACT FROM A WORST-CASE RELEASE OF AMMONIA AND AN ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM THE HIGH-PRESSURE LIQUID RECEIVER LOCATED IN ENGINE ROOM NO 3.  THIS COULD POTENTIALLY RELEASE APPROXIMATELY 16,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS A GAS AT NORMAL TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE.  IT MAY BE LIQUIFIED BY PRESSURE IN PARTS OF THE SYSTEM.  THE LIQUID WILL QUICKLY VAPORIZE BACK TO A GAS WHEN EXPOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  THIS GAS IS LIGHTER THAN AIR AND RISES QUICKLY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WITH LITTLE ENVIROMENTAL IMPACT.  AMMONIA HAS AN IRRITATING EFFECT ON INHALATION AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS.  AMMONIA IS HIGHLY WATER SOLUBLE.  A GAS CLOUD CAN BE MITIGATED EFFECTIVELY WITH WATER SPRAY.  H&M CAN PROVIDE WATER SPRAY.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CAN BE PROVIDED BY THE NORTH RICHLAND HILLS FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO INVOLVES A RELEASE FROM A SAFETY RELIEF VALVE.  THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT COULD CREATE A GAS RELEASE AT A RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 100 POUNDS PER MINUTE (TH"
