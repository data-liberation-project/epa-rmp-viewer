This ensures that appropriate engineering reviews are performed to determine if it is safe to operate at new limits. The Safe upper and lower limits is documented on the Piping and Instrument Diagrams, the Standard Operating Procedures, and in the Nevada CAPP Assessment of Risk through the Analysis of Hazards reports for each unit.\r\n-  Consequences of deviation - This effort clearly identifies the consequence of deviating outside the PSI limits.  These actions are normally identified during the development of the process hazard analyses, and are documented in the Standard Operating Procedures.\r\n\r\nKey process equipment definitions are:\r\n-  Materials of construction - information that shows which materials were used .\r\n-  Relief system design and design basis - information that provides the rationale for providing safety  relief valves (PSVs) at certain locations, the selection of the size of the relief valve, the establishment of  PSV setpoints and criteria used in designing the inlet and outlet piping of the PSV.  \r\n-  Ventilation system design - information such as airflow calculations and  equipment sizing calculations.\r\n-  Design codes - information that references the codes and standards used to form the design basis of the process.  This is a combination of industry standards and facility specific standards.  Codes used are ANSI, ASTM, NFPA, and ASME.\r\n-  Safety systems - information that fully describes all of the safety systems at the facility.  This includes control interlocks, relieving control valves, hazardous disposal systems such as flares, deluge and spray systems and ambient detectors.\r\n\r\nThe process safety information for existing processes is in accordance with CAPP/RM"

PHA team then initiates a request for updatating the deficient information to assure that the PHAs are completed properly. Updating documents is completed through the management of change request process to assure that the process safety information is always current. Each area manager is responsible for their area Process Safety Information.\r\n \r\n 3.2 Process Hazard Analysis\r\nTIMET has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled. Each covered process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nTIMET primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP is accepted by EPA, OSHA, and Nevada Dept of the Environment.  Other techniques utilized less frequently are What-If or Checklist Analysis.\r\n\r\nAll areas of the Facility covered by the regulation are subjected to a hazard evaluation.  The evaluation identified and evaluated the hazards involved in the process.  The hazards will be controlled based on the extent of the hazards, the number of potentially affected employees, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process. Hazard evaluation methods are selected based on the complexity of the process to be analyzed and the purpose of the analysis.  The methodology for new facilities will be selected based on the nature of the hazards involved, and the complexity of the process.\r\n\r\nHazard evaluations include:\r\n-  Identification of process hazards\r\n-  Review of previous incidents that had a"

The titanium sponge is crushed, pressed into compacts and then melted into ingots in vacuum arc remelt furnaces.\r\n\r\nIn Titanium Tetrachloride Production Unit, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is produced by reacting rutile ore with chlorine. Chlorine and titanium tetrachloride are the two listed substances which are required to be reported in the RMP. The resulting TiCl4 is purified and is either stored in the Titanium Tetrachloride Storage Unit or sold and shipped offsite in drums.  The TiCl4 is reduced in Vacuum Distillation Process Unit using magnesium to yield a raw titanium sponge and magnesium chloride.  Titanium sponge is further processed into titanium ingots.

TIMET communicates incident investigation findings to affected employees.\r\n\r\nAll employees will have access to process hazard analyses and other information developed under the requirements of RMP/CAPP rules.  Employees or representatives that require access to information not readily available at their work site may make arrangements through their supervisor and the proprietor of the information for an opportunity to review this information.\r\n\r\n3.9.2 Contractor Safety\r\nTIMET philosophy is that all injuries are preventable. Safety policy is intended to evaluate, monitor, and control contractor safety performance within the plant facility.  The system includes pre-award safety evaluation of contractors, contractor safety orientation, required contractor activities to promote safety, periodic contractor safety audits, monitoring of contractor injury/illnesses, and on-the-job and post-job evaluations.\r\n\r\nContractors are trained by onsite personnel about the hazards of the process, safety procedures and equipment requirements, and the emergency response procedure onsite prior to commencement of work.  All contractors scheduled to work at TIMET will receive General Safety Orientation to the plant, and Process Overview training specific to the area in which the work will be performed.  The Safety Orientation includes Rules of Conduct, Emergency Procedures, HazCom, Nevada CAPP Program, Respiratory Protection, and Personal Protective Equipment. A Visitor/Contractor Safety Orientation Card is issued to each contract employee, and documents that he/she has received and understood the information provided by TIMET.\r\n\r\nContractors must also provide basic safety training to their own employees as required by State and Federal Regulations.

Contractors at a greater risk of exposure to hazards, such as maintenance Contractors in process areas, require a program that is more comprehensive than those in lower risk activities such as janitorial, delivery materials, or engineering. Contractor Safety and contractor evaluation is the responsibility of the Safety Engineer.\r\n\r\n3.9.3 Management of Change\r\nThis policy applies when one of the following changes are made:\r\n- Process chemical or feed stock change.  An MOC is required for a change in process chemicals or process unit feed stocks that falls outside a defined range of properties.\r\n- Process technology.  An MOC is required when changes to the method of processing the chemicals are proposed. \r\n- Equipment change. An MOC is needed when making changes to process facilities and other than replacement in kind.\r\n- Process Systems and Controls. An MOC may be needed when changes are made to maintenance, operating or emergency procedures.\r\n- Operating Procedures. An MOC is required when changing operating conditions outside of the established limits (including test runs).\r\n\r\nAs a minimum, the MOC approval process must consider the following:\r\n- Technical basis for the change.\r\n- Health and safety considerations.\r\n- Impact on procedures (operating, maintenance, and safe practices).\r\n- Codes and standards.\r\n- Necessary time period for the change.\r\n- Justification of the change versus risk.\r\n\r\nAll employees and contract employees are trained to understand the concept of MOC and are expected to use these principles in their daily activities.  MOC principles apply to permanent and temporary changes. The MOC process is a communications loop to assure that the change is approved, all process safety information and procedures have been changed as necessary, and training completed.

TIMET contributes to the community by protecting the plant and surrounding community from the potentially damaging effects of emergency situations.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and reviewed by members of surrounding industrial community.\r\n\r\nThe facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur.  In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control.  The Emergency Response Plan, along with training and periodic drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects.  Local, State, and Federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Emergency Plan is to provide a cohesive procedure for coordinating effective response procedures by all plant personnel in order that danger to employees, contractors, the general public and the environment may be lessened in the event of an emergency.
