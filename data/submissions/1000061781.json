After investigating, it was determined that the ammonia vapor discharge line was obstructed by an accumulation of oil, causing the tank to become pressurized.  The blockage was upstream of the header to the ammonia vapor discharge compressors and the emergency flare associated with the ammonia storage tanks resulting in the relief valve lifting.  Road blocks along 3115 in front of the plant were established as a precautionary measure.  PCS personnel conducted monitoring along HWY 3115 between Gate C-1 and the Ammonia Plant Cooling Tower using Draeger&trade; tubes and a portable field meter.  Initial results were from 30 to 40 ppm, but by 8:38 AM the ammonia levels had dropped to 15 ppm.  After 9 AM the ammonia levels were from 0 to 5 ppm in this same area.  A total amount of 2,183 lbs of ammonia was released.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the PCS Nitrogen plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP and PSM covered processes at this facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities will help prevent potential accident scenarios. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the PCS Nitrogen plant has safety features on many units to help 1) contain and control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes. \r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n1. Process relief valves in ammonia service that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \r\n2. Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases.\r\n3.

The Safety Work Permit system is broken down into 8 types of permits.  1) Confined Space- Attendants Permit, 2) Confined Space Entry Permit, 3) General Safe Work Permit, 4) Line Breaking  Permit, 5) Hot Work Permit, 6) Electrical Permit, 7) Excavation, 8) Vehicle Entry.  The requirements of each of the permits can be found in the PCS Nitrogen Safety Manual section 11.0.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThis process ensures that all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation.  Except in emergencies, such changes are approved in writing prior to their implementation.  This review process ensures that additional risk are not introduced, all changes are documented, existing procedures are updated, new procedures are written as required, all process safety information is updated, and that all employees that are affected by the change are properly trained. \r\n\r\nProcess Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the Process Incident Investigation management system are to: 1) Carefully analyze and document the root cause(s) of the more significant problems that are encountered.  2) Identify, track and implement the corrective actions required to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of the more significant incidents and  3) Track and trend the root cause data from these incidents to identify system problems that when corrected, ca"

The core elements of the EMP are training of personnel, roles and responsibilities, emergency action levels, emergency operations center, exercises and drills, and notification procedures.  This comprehensive plan is available to all personnel in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nPCS continually strives to improve the safety of operations and the impact on the public and the environment.  PCS has fully staffed, well trained and experienced, environmental and safety departments.  All members of each department work closely together to implement sound accident and release prevention programs.  In addition, PCS has implemented an employee driven Behavioral Based safety program to operate along side the traditional safety and environmental process.  This program allows co-workers to observe each other's actions and anonymously report safe or unsafe behaviors and conditions.  Through the dedication and effort of PCS employees working toward continual improvement of SHE programs will result in further reductions of OSHA recordables and environmental releases."

The facility manufactures liquid Phosphate and Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid, Ammonium Nitrate (liquid only) and Phosphoric Acid.  The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, oleum and a flammable gas mixture (Ammonia Process - Primarily Hydrogen and Natural Gas).  The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility.  The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility for the ammonia releases and the STAWaRS model was used for the oleum releases.  The flammable gas WCS and ARS off-site consequence analyses were performed the procedures detailed in EPA's 2009 Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-site Consequence Analyses.  The reported worst case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint.  An ARS was reported f"

PCS Nitrogen employees are selected on the basis of their experience, process knowledge, operating job task requirements, and knowledge of maintenance practices.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nPCS Nitrogen's process safety information is included in the facility PSM Manual.  The process safety information in the PSM Manual provides a database to support the required elements of its PSM and Risk Management programs; as well as supplying information for PCS Nitrogen employees to identify and understand the chemical, technological, and equipment hazards associated with the process.   This information has been made available to all employees, including contractors, in PCS Nitrogens Geismar complex.  Process safety informati"

Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used.  PCS Nitrogen chose the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) and What if processes.  PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances.  The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product.  The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4) Emergency shutdown, 5) Emergency operation, 6) Normal shutdown, and 7) Start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.   \r\n\r\nTraining Plan\r\n\r\nPCS h"

      "SummaryText": "as developed a training plan that provides a guide for the training of each employee in job related and job specific responsibilities.  Each new employee is given a comprehensive orientation-training program and a basic job specific training covering their job duties and responsibilities as they relate to both normal and abnormal operating conditions.  Each employee must demonstrate the required skills to perform their job upon completion of training and must be certified and proficient in performing the duties of their assigned jobs. \r\n\r\nContractor Safety\r\n\r\nPCS developed a contractor entry authorization program in accordance with 29 CFR 191.119 and API Recommended Practice 2220, Sept. 1991.  This program outlines the entrance requirements a contractor, sales person, visitor, consultant, vendor or service company must abide by in order to perform work at the facility.  \r\n\r\nPre-Start up Review\r\n\r\nPCS conducts a pre-start up review prior to the introduction of any OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substance to ensure that new process facilities or modifications to original equipment, controls or safety interfaces of a covered process or covered system do not create a hazard to the facility personnel, civilian population surrounding the facility or the environment.  The review is also intended to ensure that hazards identified in the PHA have been properly addressed by design or procedural changes. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe mechanical integrity program establishes and implements the maintenance and inspection programs to ensure the mechanical integrity and reliability of fixed equipment, plant piping, rotating equipment, relief devices, instrumentation and electrical equipment within the covered processes.  The maintenance and inspection program includes and applies to pressure vessels, non or low pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping and piping components, heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, heaters, pressure safety relief valves, e"

      "SummaryText": "n lead to dramatic improvements in performance by eliminating whole classes of problems.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\n\r\nPCS has implemented an Emergency Management Plan (EMP) to assure the best possible prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery in the event of an emergency.  The Primary objectives of EMPs are protection of life and elimination or reduction of harm to the public, employees, contractors, and the environment.  Secondary objectives are continued production and delivery of products and services.  Response and recovery actions must minimize damage done to facilities, equipment, and both delivery and communication systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThis plan ensures that compliance audits will be conducted in each operating department and service department exposed to highly hazardous and/or regulated toxic chemicals in the covered processes every three years.  The audits are directed by both a Corporate Process Safety Assessment Procedure and an Internal Process Safety Assessment Procedure. Each audit is performed by a team that is knowledgeable of the process.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAlthough PCS Nitrogen has a stringent release prevention policy, there have been three incidents within a covered processes at the facility within the past 5 years. These are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tOn February 14, 2013, at approximately 7:45 PM operators were in the process of starting up the Urea Plant when an Aldrich Pump seal failed resulting in the release of 1,608 lbs of ammonia gas.  Facility personnel sheltered in place.  Two people were injured with one person requiring hospitalization with vision and breathing impairment.  Release notifications were promptly made to all appropriate State and federal officials.  Follow up written reports were submitted to the LDEQ, State Police, Ascension and Iberville Parish LEPCs and EPA Region VI.
