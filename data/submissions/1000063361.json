The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Mayfield Dairy Farms (MDF) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of MDF?s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, MDF is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Mayfield Dairy Farms facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n\n\n3.

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n\n\n4.    The five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nA five-year accident history has been updated and included in the RMP.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future incidents, Mayfield Dairy Farms has improved training practices to ensure all employees understand the proper procedures for dealing with any ammonia release.\n\n\n\n5.    The emergency response program\n\n\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Mayfield Dairy Farms has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  MDF conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.  The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for infor"

The flexibility of the program allows MDF to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of MDF employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.
