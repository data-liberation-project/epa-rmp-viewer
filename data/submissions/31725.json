The plant is a merchant facility marketing the electrical power on the open power exchange market and ancillary service support to the California Independent Systems Operator (CAL-ISO) grid. Electricity generated by this facility is transported by lines owned by Pacific Gas and Electric.  LMEC will provide steam and electricity to USS-POSCO and backup power to Dow Chemical. \n\nThe facility currently stores aqueous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in two 10,000 gallon steel bulk storage tanks.  Ammonia is used at the Los Medanos Energy Center to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Ammonia is pumped from a storage tank, diluted with exhaust gases, and injected into the two Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at Los Medanos Energy Center exceeds the federal RMP and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 20,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP and CalARP regulations.  The aqueous ammonia process is a Program 2 process.\n\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nManagement System\n\nRisk Management Program regulations require those facilities with processes subject to Program 2 to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.

The Checklist method uses industry checklists or checklists developed by staff familiar with the process. \n\nWith the concurrence of the Contra Costa County Health Services Department, the What-If Analysis/Checklist method was selected for evaluating potential accidental releases at Los Medanos Energy Center.   Calpine Corporation believes this approach provides the most detailed and applicable level of analysis, incorporating both general industry information and plant-specific knowledge.\n\nThe initial aqueous ammonia Hazard Review was performed at LMEC on November 2, 2000.  The Hazard Review team consisted of process operating and maintenance personnel, health and safety personnel and engineers. Hazard Review team used a piping and instrumentation diagram to systematically identify causes of potential aqueous ammonia releases.    \n\nThe Hazard Review team brainstormed recommendations to reduce the risk of accidental aqueous ammonia releases for each significant release scenario.  Significant release scenarios were defined as any accidental release that would probably occur during the lifetime of LMEC and could result in an onsite injury requiring medical treatment, or any offsite injury or death.\n\n\nThe Hazard Review will be updated again within a 5-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any significant findings from the analysis was prepared and included confirming vendor procedures, posting speed limits, posting unloading procedures, confirming maintenance procedures, and labeling the tank fill lines.
