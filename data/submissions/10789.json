This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, accidental release prevention, and mitigation, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Enogex's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE CALUMET GAS PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n The Calumet gas plant, located approximately 7 miles northwest of Calumet in Canadian County, Oklahoma, operates a refrigerated lean oil plant to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane) and natural gas liquids comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The process to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Calumet gas plant which contain above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n \n7 'BG' Storage Tank comprised of C3+ mixture.\n \n In order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the Calumet gas plant.\n \n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n The Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this program level 3 gas plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the C3+.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 292,350 lbs. (80% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and igni"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to corporate management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n  Operating Procedures\n \n The Calumet gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n \n In addition, the Calumet gas plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Calumet gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills de"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Calumet gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n  \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n The Calumet gas plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n \n The PHA team findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Enogex gas plant facilities.\n \n The overall emergency response program for the Calumet gas plant is coordinated with the Canadian County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Calumet gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n \n  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \n The Calumet gas plant resolves high priority findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA,"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n Contractors\n \n The Calumet gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Calumet gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \n The Calumet gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
