      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.0  Introduction\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the RMP rule (68.150 through 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc.\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. is committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. implements reasonable control to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.\n\n3.0  Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. manufactures trifluorochloroethylene (CTFE), which is listed in the RMP regulations as a flammable material. CTFE is stored on site in a 33,000 lbs and 10,000 lbs capacity storage tanks.    Because the CTFE storage creates the potential for offsite consequences resulting from an accidental release of CTFE and the process is included"

      "SummaryText": "in one of the 10 \"targeted\" NAICS codes, the process falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program.  \n\n4.0  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe RMP rule requires Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. to perform an offsite consequence analysis for one worst-case and  alternative release scenarios for CTFE, a flammable substance.  The worst-case release scenario is the unlikely complete release of 33,000 lbs. of CFTE from a failure of the largest storage tank.  The released CTFE is assumed to form a vapor cloud which subsequently explodes.  The endpoint distance corresponding to a 1 PSI overpressure is 0.1 miles.  Within this short distance there are no residences, nor are there any environmental receptors within this distance.  There are, however, a number of commercial operations within this distance.\n\nAn alternative release scenario for CTFE would involve a release from a valve of flange failure adjacent to a process storage vessel containing CTFE.  It is assumed that the release occurs at a typical capacity, i.e. 10,000 lbs. of CTFE is released.  The endpoint distance corresponding to a 1 PSI overpressure is 0.1 miles.  Within this short distance there are no residences, nor are there any environmental receptors within this distance.  There are, however, a number of commercial operations within this distance.\n\n5.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe RMP rule requires a Program 3 prevention program for CTFE processes. The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc., which apply to these processes.\nSafety Information\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the covered process.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc., including CTFE.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design bas"

Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood.\nCTFE-Specific Prevention Steps\nIndustry standards are followed at Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. to help ensure safe handling of CTFE.  The storage tanks design and construction is consistent with American National Standards Institute codes.  Workers who perform operations with CTFE receive training emphasizing safe operating procedures for CTFE developed by Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc.\n\n6.0  Five-Year Accident History\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. maintains a 5-year accident history that fulfills the requirement of the RMP rule (68.42).  This facility is set to begin operations following the development and implementation of the RMP.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. in that time that have resulted in consequences of interest (i.e. deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site).\n\n7.0  Emergency Response Program\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel, and the company provides appropriate information to the fire chief.  Solvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities.\n\n8.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSolvay Fluoropolymers, Inc. constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes at the plant through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  At this time there are no planned safety improvements."
