Trained personnel onsite would be the first on the scene to assess and repair the chlorine leak.  The Fire Department or Fortuna Police Department would seal off the area and stand by with fresh oxygen containers.  The movement of the gas cloud would be monitored and depending on the prevailing wind direction, further evacuations could become necessary.\n\nSafety Training\n\nThe City of Fortuna maintains special training for dealing with toxic substances.  All employees complete a chlorine awareness course twice a year, provided by either a certified vendor or by the City of Fortuna.   All aspects of chlorine safety are covered, including emergency container repair.  Plant employees are trained in the use of chlorine institute A and B container repair kits.  Tyvek suits, rubber gloves and boots, and a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus are all located at the Fortuna Wastewater Treatment Plant.  All employees complete a CPR class, as well. \n\nAccident History\n\nDue to an excellent accidental release program and safe practices the City of Fortuna has never experienced an accidental release of the regulated substance chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nCompliance with Rules and Regulations\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the City of Fortuna is and has been in compliance with rules and regulations regarding the toxic substance chlorine, with federal, state, and local authorities.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nAt this time the City of Fortuna has no planned safety improvements dealing with chlorine or the chlorinating process.  However, in order to maintain a high standard of safety, meetings are held on the first day of each week to discuss any safety matters"

For the worst-case scenario, the effective distance to a toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.9 miles.  The effective distance encompasses approximately 1,200 people, Fortuna Union High School, U.S. 101 Freeway, and a small portion of the Eel River.  The worst-case scenario does not account for the current vented containment, existing chlorine detection alarm system, or strength of the chlorine tanks.  \n \n7 An alternative scenario was modeled taking into account the strength of the chlorine tanks, assuming the leak was not a rupture, but from gas transfer equipment.  The alternative scenario considered the current vented enclosure of the chlorine storage tanks and chlorine detection alarms.  For the alternative scenario, the effective distance to a toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.2 miles.  However, the alternative scenario does not consider the vacuum that the chlorinating system experiences under operation.  When a leak occurs in the chlorinating system the vacuum is lost causing all gas flow to stop, resulting in a very small loss of chlorine gas.  The effective distance only encompasses portions of the Fortuna Wastewater Treatment Plant and Public Works Department.\n\nThe City of Fortuna feels the alternative scenario is a more appropriate modeling scenario for the chlorinating process at the Fortuna Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe City of Fortuna maintains a detailed emergency response plan.  In the event of an accidental release the chlorine detection system would sound an alarm and a rotating beacon would alert plant personnel. The City of Fortuna is coordinated with the Fortuna Police Department and the Volunteer Fire Department.  The Fortuna Police Department is notified automatically by a resident emergency response monitoring system, and the"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nThe City of Fortuna is submitting this executive summary in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program including the Federal Accidental Release Prevention program [Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68] with certain additions specific to the state pursuant to Article 2, Chapter 6.95, of the Health and Safety Code.\n\nBackground\n\nThe City of Fortuna is located in Humboldt County on California's Scenic North Coast and is approximately 250 miles north of San Francisco.  The wastewater treatment plant, which was constructed in 1958, serves a population of approximately 10,063 people.  Wastewater flows from the City of Fortuna range between 0.75 million gallons per day during dry weather and 2.4 million gallons per day during winter storms.  Most wastewater receives secondary treatment with activated sludge.  Secondary clarifier overflow is disinfected and dechlorinated prior to discharge to the Eel River at the confluence of Strongs Creek.  Wastewater is discharged to a percolation pond on an exposed gravel bar during summer months.   A series of ponds provides influent flow equalization during winter storms.  During prolonged periods of precipitation chlorinated effluent from the final pond discharges to Strongs Creek near the confluence with the Eel River.\n\nRegulated Toxic Substance in Question\nThe City of Fortuna currently uses 4,000 pounds of chlorine, Standard Industrial Classification code (2812), in a process to disinfect wastewater.  The chlorine is stored as a liquid under pressure, which enables operators to use the chlorine gas for the disinfecting process.  The City of Fortuna has used chlorine for this purpose since 1958.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed using an EPA recommended air dispersion model, RMP*Comp. Both worst-case and alternative scenarios were evaluated using the air dispersion model. \n \n7 The worst-case scenario was m"
