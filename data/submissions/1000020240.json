The BASF Corporation Beaumont Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the BASF Beaumont Site\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility fully complies with the EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard. Extensive efforts have been made to avoid situations that could provide the conditions which could lead to the release of any chemical used on site. The efforts include (1) HAZOP or Zurich analysis of all new or modified systems, (2) Pre-startup safety reviews, and (3) Specific operating procedures for normal conditions as well emergency situations.\n\nIt is the policy of this site to train employees to respond to emergencies including fire and chemical spill. The site maintains an Emergency Response Team trained as per the applicable standards. This Team drills periodically to maintain effectiveness and be ready if a accident should occur.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site produces several brands of trade name herbicides. These include:\nBanvel(R), Clarity(R), Distinct(R) and Frontier(R), as well as a variety of other formulations, which are used in the farm sector to enhance growth, to eliminate weeds, and to improve the yield in general Chlorine, dimethylamine, methyl chloride, and formaldehyde are used to produce some of these products. \nWorst Case\nToxic gas release of chlorine with off-site impacts resulting from the rupture of a chlorine railcar.

Active mitigation consists of diluting anhydrous dimethylamine with water upon receiving it, which drastically reduces its flammability.\nA vessel leak of formaldehyde with minimal off-site impact Passive mitigation considered is a dike, drains and a sump. Active mitigation consists of a water curtain and fire watered foam monitors. \n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility fully complies with the EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard. The facility purchases equipment that meets requirements for the intended service as specified by BASF engineering standards.  The Site inspects, and maintains equipment and piping as recommended by the codes applicable for that equipment and service. All BASF engineering standards are based on Recognized And Generally Accepted Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP). All changes to the process are thoroughly evaluated before implementation. This is our first and most effective prevention program against chemical leaks within the site. \n\nThe site also maintains remote sensors for chlorine at the railcar unload area that alarm in the control room to alert the staff if a release is detected. Remote sensors for flammability are provided in the unload areas and tank farms that alarm in the control room to alert the staff if a leak is detected. \n\nAdditionally, the operations employees regularly walk through the process areas to look for leaks of any chemicals.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThis facility has"

The site maintains a complete fire fighting facility manned by volunteer employees who receive extensive training. This training consists of offsite training as well as regularly scheduled on-site drills. There is a plant wide system of fire water piping with pumps and power. A system of foam generators is available wherever flammable solvents are stored and throughout the tank farm.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe policy of the BASF corporation is to always seek ways to improve the safety of our facilities. We do this through soliciting ideas from all employees and contractors, accident investigations, and hazard reviews. Any action items from these sources are recorded into a database and tracked to completion.\n\n"
