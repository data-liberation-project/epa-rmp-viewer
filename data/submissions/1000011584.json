      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction and Background\n The City of Boynton Beach Utility Department is committed to delivering quality drinking water and responsive service to its customers, and strives to be a good neighbor to the people who live near its treatment plants. This document is the Boynton Beach East Water Treatment Plant (EWTP) Risk Management Program/Process Safety Management Plan (RMP/PSMP), which details the prevention programs that have been implemented at the EWTP to prevent and minimize the emergency release of chlorine gas. \n Because the EWTP stores chlorine gas above the threshold quantity, shown in Table ES-1, the City is required to develop a plan to prevent and minimize emergency releases of chlorine gas to the atmosphere in quantities that could potentially affect the public beyond the facility's boundaries. The RMP regulations are from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which are detailed and codified in Chapter 40 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Part 68. The PSMP regulation is from the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Standards, which are detailed in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTable ES-1 RMP/PSMP Threshold Quantity for Chlorine Gas\nChemical Name - Chlorine \nLocation Used or Stored - Chlorine Building \nChemical Abstract Service Number -7782-50-5\nEPA RMP Threshold Quantity (pounds)- 2,500\nOSHA PSMP Threshold Quantity (pounds)- 1,500\nMaximum Quantity on Site (pounds)- 30,000\n\n The chlorination process at the EWTP is subject to the most stringent of the three RMP programs, Program 3, which has three major requirements. The first requirement is a Hazard Assessment, in which the effects of a release from a regulated substance could have on the public are determined. The Hazard Assessment for the EWTP has been completed and can be found in the document titled \"Offsite Hazard Assessment for the City of Boynton Beach East Water Treatment Plant\" located in the Control Room of the EWTP.

      "SummaryText": "requirement is a Prevention Program, which consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third requirement is an Emergency Response Program, which requires development of a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. The second and third requirements are detailed in this document.\n Because the RMP and PSM regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program of the RMP also serve as the OSHA PSMP; therefore, this document is referred to as the RMP/PSMP. This RMP/PSMP is divided into 13 sections, each representing a paragraph of requirements from the OSHA PSM Standard.\n \nHazard Assessment\n A Hazard Assessment was performed for the Boynton Beach EWTP to determine the effects a chlorine gas release would have on the public. In this assessment, the distance a set endpoint concentration (3mg/L) of chlorine gas would travel was estimated. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine gas was determined and sensitive receptors, such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes, were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst-case\" and an \"alternative case.\" As part of the June 21, 2004 RMP Update the Hazard Assessment was updated using 2000 Census data.\n In fulfillment of the newly revised regulations, the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative case\" scenarios are not being presented in the executive summary.\n\nPrevention Program\n The Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, make up the core of the RMP/PSMP. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements, listed below, which are designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. These elements were developed by the City of Boynton Beach with the assistance of CH2M HILL.\n \n* Employee Participation\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Process Safety Information\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n*"

      "SummaryText": "Contractor Safety\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Hot Works\n* Management of Change\n* Incident Investigation\n* Emergency Response Program\n* Compliance Audit\n \n The participation of the Boynton Beach EWTP staff in preparing the RMP/PSMP was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation was valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\n EWTP staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops. They also participated in the development of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The initial PHA was conducted on March 9, 1999 and the most recent PHA was conducted on July 18, 2007.  \nStaff who operate and maintain the chlorine gas processes were trained in how to safely maintain and operate the chlorine gas processes. Initial training was held on April 20 and 22, 1999. The most recent refresher training was held on August 20, 2009. All other EWTP staff received initial RMP/PSMP awareness training on May 17 and 18, 1999, which detailed how the new requirements may impact their jobs. The most recent refresher RMP/PSMP awareness training was held on August 21, 2002. \n The remaining elements of the Prevention Program were developed with the assistance of the Chief Operator and the Maintenance Supervisor. These elements initially went into affect on June 21, 1999 and were reviewed for the June 21, 2009 submittal.\n \nPrevention Measures\n To protect the welfare of the community, staff, and the environment, the City has taken many proactive steps over the last decade to minimize potential hazards related to chlorine gas. It has satisfied and exceeded the requirements of RMP/PSMP, and has a number of preventative measures in place to guard against the release of chlorine gas.
