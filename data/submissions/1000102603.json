To minimize rework, September 22, 2022, was selected as the date to end collecting information regarding this initial submission. Consequently, any reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Diamond Green Diesel Port Arthur Facility is a newly-constructed facility that has not yet started operation as of the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  Accordingly, no accidental releases of RMP-regulated toxic or flammable materials have occurred to date.  \n\nDiamond Green Diesel will keep records for all accidental chemical releases that may occur at our facility in the future.   If any future incidents occur, the facility will conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events, and report any qualifying releases in accordance with RMP requirements.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Diamond Green Diesel Port Arthur Facility has developed initial emergency response and spill response contingency plans, which comply with all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have developed procedures that outline the emergency actions to be taken as required. This is the Emergency Response Protocol. The ERP is located on the Rig"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity programs\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup safety reviews\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigations\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permitting\n* Contractor safety programs\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nOur goal in the facility is for release prevention rather than mitigation; however, operations personnel are trained in initial response to contain or minimize any release. The emergency response team, made up of highly trained employees, will be on the scene to assist or take"

Following its initial startup, the facility will produce low-carbon diesel from sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, inedible animal fats derived from processing meat fats and fuel-grade corn oil.  The Port Arthur Facility has a production capacity of 470 million gallons per year of renewable green diesel.\n\nThe Port Arthur Facility will process, use, and store certain materials that the US EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, as follows:\n\nFlammables\nThe Diamond Green Diesel Port Arthur Facility operates three (3) processes that will contain greater than threshold quantities of flammable mixtures (i.e., 10,000 lbs), upon initial charge"
