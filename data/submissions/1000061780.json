The Risk Management Plan, will be referred to as the RMP, and will address the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors and the community and environment at large with regards to hazardous chemical releases.  The RMP is organized to correspond with the EPA Risk Management Plan, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, Subpart G, and Model Risk Management Program for Ammonia Refrigeration.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWatershed Foods, LLC is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.  It is Watershed Foods policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.  RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors, (public and environmental).  Watershed Foods has developed an Emergency Action Plan that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Watershed Foods facility is located at 202 North Ford Street in Gridley, IL.

There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for cold storage and freeze drying processes.\r\nThe amount of ammonia present in the Freezer refrigeration system is approximately 8,000 pounds.  The Freezer refrigeration system is a single stage system with three (3) low stage compressors. Air Handling Units and ICM Dashers are fed with pumped liquid from the receiver, through the recirculator.  This system is used to cool the main freezer area, USDA room, Shipping and Receiving Dock, Depositing room and process and the depositing holding area.\r\nThe amount of ammonia present in the Freeze Dryer refrigeration system is approximately 17,000 pounds.  The Freeze Dryer system can either be run on low stage or dual stage.  This system consists of two (2) compressors which can either be run on low stage if demand is low or high stage if demand is high.  There is also another low low stage compressor for this system that is used if demand is high.  Dryer Vapor Traps and air handling units in the process areas are fed with pumped liquid from the receivers, through the recirculator.  This system is used to cool 6 dryers, the traying room, hardening room, and Dryer 6 holding and prep area.\r\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite between the Freezer and Freeze Dryer refrigeration systems is approximately 25,000 pounds which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\nAn aerial photo of the site is included as Appendix A.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM standard 29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP standard 40 CFR 68).
