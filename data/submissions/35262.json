Box 98, Funk, NE 68940                  \n      Mailing Address\n\nRisk Management Plan  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of\nany accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on\nthe specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in\noperating country or terminal grain elevators\", however we are also engaged  in providing\n\"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for\ndelivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and\nreloading is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\". Anhydrous Ammonia is received,\nstored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early and fall months.  During\nthe balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs . The maximum quantity handled at a\ngiven time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  \nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are in"

      "SummaryText": "spected  at various times of day and night throughout\nthe year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm), environmental, public and private receptors have been provided to the County LEPC. \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm), envirnonmental, private and public receptors have been provided to the County LEPC.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".   We conduct\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, \nBreakaway couplers at risers,  Emergency shut-off valves,  Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or\nother vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.   We also maintain\nroutine contact with our local fire department and emergency response per"
