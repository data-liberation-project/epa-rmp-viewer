              "Description": "Prevention Program Description:\n\nThe Airgas Waukesha plant operates a filling operation following OSHA PSM and EPA RMP guidelines and requirements for propane.\n\nThe Waukesha covered process receives liquid propane by tractor trailer and is stored onsite, in a bulk vessel. Propane is then transferred into gas cylinders and distributed to customers. The highly flammable and hazardous nature of propane in the process makes it necessary for Airgas associates to observe certain and well defined safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel, property and nearby members of the community. Airgas policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program. Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nAirgas USA, LLC operates a propane storage/filling facility with 32 employees in Waukesha, WI. The facility is manned 12-20 hours per day. The Waukesha propane process receives product by propane transport truck that is stored onsite a bulk storage vessel (108,000 lbs / 30,000 gallons) before being transferred into gas cylinders then distributed to customers. Cylinders containing between 20 and 100 lbs of propane are filled on a daily basis. Each is weighed after filling, increasing operational safety. Acetylene is produced on site by the reaction of calcium carbide with water. The process is contained in a generator where acetylene gas is piped to cylinders that have already been filled with acetone. The acetylene must be dissolved in acetone in order to stabilize it. This ratio is determined based on cylinder weight. \n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical:\n\nPropane is stored and transferred on site is listed as a highly hazardous chemical under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The Airgas Waukesha, WI onsite inventory of propane is in excess of 10,000 pounds making the propane process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP covered process. \n\nAcetylene stored and transferred on site is listed as a highly hazardous chemical under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The Airgas Waukesha, WI onsite inventory of acetylene is in excess of 10,000 pounds when dissolved in acetone  in cylinders making the acetylene process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP covered process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe highly flammable and hazardous nature of propane and acetylene in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.
