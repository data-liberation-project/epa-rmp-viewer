Hydrogen and methane, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous and liquid hydrogen. Gaseous hydrogen is used by our customer in their manufacturing process. Gaseous hydrogen is produced in the reformer process (See Reformer Process below) and transmitted to the customer via pipeline. The pipeline is connected to a 20,000 gallon liquid hydrogen backup tank that supplies the pipeline when the reformer is off-line. Gaseous hydrogen exists in various stages of purity at the Sacramento plant, depending on where it is in the manufacturing process. Ultimately the product gaseous"

      "SummaryText": " hydrogen sent to P&G is pure hydrogen. \n\n\n\nLiquid hydrogen is also produced from the hydrogen gas taken from the reformer process. Liquid hydrogen is produced by putting hydrogen gas through a series of compression, cooling and expansion steps. The liquid hydrogen is stored in two 70,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tanks and the backup 20,000 gallon tank.  Liquid hydrogen is loaded into highway tankers and shipped to various off-site customers. Liquid hydrogen stored on site is pure hydrogen. \n\n\n\nREFORMER PROCESS: Hydrocarbon based gases (natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feed stock is then compressed and cracked in our reformer (furnace).  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in adsorbers.  The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to customers or the hydrogen liquifier via pipe. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable mixture (hydrogen and methane). \n\n\n\nThe site stores liquid hydrogen in two 70,000 gallon tanks and one 20,000 gallon tank. The site also has a small amount of gaseous hydrogen/ methane contained in the operating process equipment and lines. \n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and OSHAA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\nAs part of the basic prevention plan a formal HAZOP was performed considering hazards such as toxic release, fire, explosion, runaway reactions, ove"

Design features employed to prevent and/or mitigate possible release events include bullards (bump posts) to protect process and storage equipment and structural design to meet Seismic Zone 4 standards.\n\n\n\nThe Sacramento facility employs both company wide and site-specific operating procedures to assure safe and proper plant operations.  In addition to plant operation's training, all personnel complete the company's Environmental, Health, and Safety training and maintain competence through regularly scheduled refresher courses and program updates.
