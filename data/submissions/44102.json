Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis City of West Sacramento Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located at 1991 South River Road, West Sacramento, California, handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are both considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of West Sacramento's Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to treat 7.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater from the residences and businesses of the City. The treatment process consists of bar screens, three primary clarifiers, an activated sludge aeration basin with an anoxic selector, two secondary clarifiers, a chlorine contact chamber, dechlorination and pH adjustment system, discharge pumps to treated wastewater to the Sacramento River, three anaerobic digesters, and two sludge dewatering belt presses.\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater to prevent the spread of pathogenic organisms. Sulfur dioxide is used to neutralize the chlorine before it is discharged into the Sacramento River. Chlorine is toxic to the aquatic life-cycle. \n\nChlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP.  Off-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a"

Four other chlorine containers are placed on stand-by, and four more chlorine containers are in storage near-by. The WWTP has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 12 one-ton containers for a total of 24,000 pounds.\n\nSulfur dioxide is delivered by a commercial supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP.  Off-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist. All the one-ton containers are placed in the sulfur dioxide storage area.  Five of the sulfur dioxide containers that are on-line are placed on the load- cell scale. Five of the sulfur dioxide containers are placed on stand-by, and five more sulfur dioxide containers are in storage near-by.  The WWTP has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of sulfur dioxide system to no more than 15 one-ton containers for a total of 30,000 pounds.  \n\nBoth the chlorine and sulfur dioxide one-ton containers are delivered during normal working hours. The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers and loading of the empty one-ton containers. The delivery area is exposed to vehicular traffic.  The building is locked after normal working hours.  No unauthorized personnel are allowed entry into the building. The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThis treatment facility operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas are withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the gas from the one-ton containers at"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of West Sacramento Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Yolo County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if there are any other commitments that need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances."
