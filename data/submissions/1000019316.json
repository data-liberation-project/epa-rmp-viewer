The stationary source is involved in the production of various cultured dairy products.  Ammonia liquified under pressure is the only regulated chemical exceeding a threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n     Upstate Niagara Culture (UNCc) Facility proactively uses the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119, in conjunction with the additional off-site considerations addressed in 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart D, as an accidental ammonia release prevention program.  These documents are considered as working documents by UNCc management, and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases of ammonia.  There have been no reportable accidents at the UNCc facility since operations began.\n\n     Emergency response policies for the UNCc Facility include an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\"; 29 CFR 1910.120 \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\"; 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know\"; 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management\";  and 40 CFR Part 68 \"Risk Management Program\".  The integration of the programs for the UNCc Facility increases the usefullness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  Currently, UNCc does not perform any emergency response measures with in-house personnel.  Local ammonia contractors and/or emergency response agencies handle all types of ammonia releases.  Community notification policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.\n\n     The accidental release prevention program integrates the OSHA Process Safety Management required under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the additional off-site considerations addressed in the 40 CFR Part 6"
