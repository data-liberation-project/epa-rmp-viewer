              "Description": "\nII. PROPER OPERATION/HANDLING PROCEDURES FOR LISTED HAZARDOUS PROCESSES IN THE FACILITY\n\n40 CFR Part 68 requires a risk management plan for facilities storing or using certain listed hazardous chemicals above the reporting thresholds. The Hydroflouric acid solution in the acid etching process at Beeco Technology exceeds the 1,000 pound reporting threshold. The remaining chemicals used at the facility do not exceed the reporting thresholds or are not listed. However, each process that includes any hazardous material must have a proper safe operating procedure to prevent accidental releases. This plan includes proper handling for unloading, storing, opening and dispensing of hazardous chemicals. In general, all supplies that are delivered to Beeco Technology are immediately put in their respective storage locations.\n\nA. Acid Etching Line/Room \nWithin the process room for acid etching of the glass, there are several tanks with a Hydroflouric acid solution which is used to etch patterns into the glass mirrors. Also located in this room are two cleaning machines which use a Sodium Hydroxide based stripper to remove the resist paint applied to the glass to protect the areas that are not etched. Also located in the room is a Trichloroethylene Vapor Degreaser used for cleaning the glass on prototype pieces. This unit is only used occasionally (less than once a year for the past two years). The glass acid Etching line uses the following chemicals to perform the process and to treat the waste water prior to leaving the facility:\nHydroflouric acid 70% - glass etching process chemical\nCaustic Potash 45% - rinse water pH adjustment\nCaustic Soda Liquid 50% - waste water treatment\nSodium Hydroxide (MTE 540 Beeco Strip) - Cleaner/stripper\nRecycled Sodium Hydroxide (MTE 540 Beeco Strip) - waste water treatment\nTrichloroethylene - Vapor Degreaser\n\n1. Hydroflouric acid (Hydrogen Fluoride)\n\nThe Hydroflouric acid solution used at the facility comes in a 55 gallon drum and is in a 70% concentration. This is the only reportable chemical under 40 CFR Part 68 which has triggered the Program 2 level for a Risk Management Plan. When the 55 gallon drums arrive at the facility they are unloaded in the covered dock area of the facility (location 21 on site map, page 36 of this plan). After they are unloaded from the delivery truck, if they are to be held on the dock for any length of time, they are place on containment pallets. The maximum duration at the facility of these containers being left on the dock is less than two hours.  \nFrom the dock area they are taken directly to the acid Storage room (location 4 on site map, page 36 of this plan). This room is a contained room with sufficient diking and containment for the maximum size of container (55 gallons drums) of Hydroflouric acid stored on site. Generally the maximum amount of containers on site is generally less the 8 at any one time. When the Hydroflouric acid Solution is being dispersed into the acid fill bucket, the 55 gallon drum is placed on a containment pallet. The solution is pumped out of the drum into the acid dispensing bucket by an employee. The employee has been trained and is wearing the proper personal protective equipment (e.g. face shield, protective gloves, protective apron). Once the acid dispensing bucket is filled to the proper amount, it is carried into the acid etching room where the solution is pored into the individual tanks as needed. In the event of any accidental release, the spill team leader is immediately notified and the area of the spill is evacuated. A clean up then takes place.\n\n2. Caustic Potash 45%\n\nThe Caustic Potash used in the acid etching process is a solid powder which is stored in the pumice polishing room on pallets (location 6 on site map, page 36 of this plan). The caustic potash is received on shrink wrapped pallets generally containing 50 bags. This pallet of material is unloaded from the delivery truck and taken to the pumice polishing room. It is stored here on the pallet and is used directly from the pallet on a as needed basis. This material is used to control the pH in the water rinse tanks in the acid etching operation to neutralize the acid carried over from the glass during the process. This material is considered stable under normal conditions and is stored away from the Hydroflouric acid.\n\n3. Liquid Caustic Soda 50%\n\nThe Liquid Caustic Soda is used at the facility in the acid etching waste water treatment / stabilization process prior to discharging the water to the sanitary sewer. The chemical is delivered and stored in 55 gallon drums. The solution is used in the treatment tank and is pumped in by demand determined by the pH of the waste water leaving the facility. When the 55 gallon drums arrive at the facility, they are unloaded in the covered dock area of the facility (location 21 on site map, page 36 of this plan). After they are unloaded from the delivery truck, if they are to be held on the dock for any length of time, they are place on containment pallets. The maximum duration of these containers being left on the dock is less than two hours.  From the dock area, they are taken directly to the acid Storage room (location 4 on site map, page 36 of this plan). This room is a contained room with sufficient diking and containment for the maximum amount of a 55 gallon plastic drum. To insure that the Caustic Soda solution does not mix with the acid solution stored in the room, all Caustics are stored on separate containment pallets. This minimizes the risk of the two chemicals mixing in the case of an accidental release in this area.\n\n4. MTE Beeco Strip (Sodium Hydroxide solution)\n\nThe MTE Beeco Strip is a Sodium Hydroxide Solution which is used in the two cleaners located in the acid Etching room. This process removes the resist coating applied to the glass areas where etching is not desired. The MTE Beeco Strip is stored in plastic 55 gallon drums. When the 55 gallon drums arrive at the facility the are unloaded in the covered dock area of the facility (location 21 on site map, page 36 of this plan). After they are unloaded from the delivery truck, if they are to be held on the dock for any length of time, they are place on containment pallets. The maximum duration of these containers being left on the dock is less than two hours.  From the dock area they are taken directly to the acid Storage room (location 4 on site map, page 36 of this plan). This room is a contained room with sufficient diking and containment for the maximum amount of a 55 gallon plastic drum. To insure that the Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic solution) does not mix with the acid Solution stored in the room, all Caustics are stored on separate containment pallets. This minimizes the risk of the two chemicals mixing in the case of an accidental release in this area. \n\nThe Sodium Hydroxide solution is also reclaimed and recycled at the facility and is used in waste water treatment for the acid etching process and the Paintline process at the facility. The reclaimed Sodium Hydroxide Solution is stored in 55 gallon plastic drums near the flammable paint storage room (location 27 on site map, page 36 of this plan). The drums are move to the areas where they must be dispensed for waste water treatment on an as needed basis. If the drum is not completely emptied it is returned to the storage area. The area where the recycled solution is stored is a diked area described above.\n\n5.Trichloroethylene\n\nThe Trichloroethylene used in the vapor degreaser in the acid etching room is a self contained unit. The Trichloroethylene is pumped directly from the delivery truck into the degreasing unit and is stored in the units tank. The unit remains closed until the occasional operation is performed. Historically the unit has only generated 550 pounds of waste within the past two years. There is also a reclamation still located next to the cleaner which removes the impurities from the solution and dispenses the waste directly into a waste drum. \n\nB. Flammable Liquids\n\nAll paints, solvents and inks used in the facility are purchased on a as needed basis and are stored in one of the two flammable liquid storage rooms(locations, 3 {ink solvents, clean up solvents and inks}, 26 {spray paints and related solvents} on site map, page 36 of this plan). When the various sized containers arrive, they are unloaded in the covered dock area (location 21 on site map, page 36 of this plan). The containers range in size from one pint to 55 gallon drums. After they are unloaded from the delivery truck, if they are to be held on the dock for any length of time, they are place on containment pallets. The maximum duration at the facility of these containers being left on the dock is less than two hours.  From the dock area, they are taken directly to the individual flammable liquid storage rooms. All flammable liquids are used on a as needed basis, and only the required amount is taken out of the storage areas for use. Typically enough for one shift, as required by OSHA.\n\nC. Chromic acid Stripper\n\nThe Chromic acid stripper unit is a self contained unit which generates no waste and uses a dry powdered Chromic acid which is mixed water in the unit. The 55 gallon drums of Chromic acid powder are stored by the unit, in a cool dry location.\n\nD. Paintline/mirroring\n\nThe Paintline is the process where the backing paint and mirroring chemicals are applied. Use of hazardous materials in this area is on a as needed basis. The waste water treatment tanks located on the south wall of this area contain some of the recycled Sodium Hydroxide to control pH. All flammable liquids are stored in the flammable liquid storage areas when they are not being used on this process line.\n\nE. Spray Booths\n\nThe four spray booths (locations, 14, 15, 16, 17 on site map, page 36 of this plan), use spray paints and solvents on a as needed basis. All mixing of spray paint and cleaning of equipment occurs in the flammable storage room (location 26 on site map, page 36 of this plan). All paints and materials are always stored in the proper areas after delivery to Beeco Technology.",
