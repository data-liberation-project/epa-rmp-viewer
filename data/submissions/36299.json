The process involves the manufacture of vinyl acetate-ethylene (VAE) copolymer emulsions.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe plant maintains vinyl acetate monomer and ethylene inventories which exceed the RMP threshold quantity for toxic liquids and flammable gases respectively.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  Air Products Polymers, LP manages the safety of our facilities by designing for safe operation, operating the plant safely, maintaining the plant, and by auditing our operations. \n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the request of local fire support through the South Brunswick Township Industrial Mutual Aid Council (SBIMAC), the LEPC, and the South Brunswick Office of Emergency Management so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders if necessary.\n\nAir Products Polymers, LP is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Air Products Polymers, LP is a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The Dayton, NJ facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as SBIMAC and the South Brunswick Township Community Advisory Panel.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68) and New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJAC 7:31).

The facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility is located on Corn Road in Middlesex County.  To produce water-based VAE copolymer emulsions, vinyl acetate liquid and ethylene vapor are first emulsified in water and then polymerized in reactors.  The products, non-hazardous liquids, are shipped by railcar, bulk trucks, or packages to industrial customers for applications such as latex paints, non-woven binders, adhesives, and building products.  Vinyl acetate monomer is present on site in quantities greater than the RMP threshold quantity in storage tanks, railcars, piping and the processing unit to maintain continuous and efficient production. Ethylene is present onsite in quantities greater than the RMP threshold quantity in a cryogenic liquid storage tank, a vapor storage tank, tank trucks, piping, occasionally a railcar and the processing unit to maintain continuous and efficient production.\n\n\n3. The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\n\nCases have been identified and properly documented in the RMP.\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Dayton, NJ plant is covered as a Program Level 3.  Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Air Products manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating the plant safely, maintaining the plant safely, and by auditing our operations.\n\nOur facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, water deluge systems, fail-safe valves, and dikes for the unlikely case of a liquid leak.  Systems and equipment are designed  to applicable engineering standards and codes.  Safety reviews are conducted for all new installations and modifications to existing processes.  \n\nOur plant is operated safely by trained and certified operato"

Process safety meetings are held regularly for all operating and maintenance personnel including contractors.  Investigations are conducted for incidents.\n\nWe maintain operational safety through preventive maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  We hold contractors to the same high safety training standards as our employees.  We implement task observation and accident prevention techniques.\n\nWe routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state, and local regulation.  We also have a program to audit the plant's performance against corporate environmental and safety standards.  \n\n5. Five year accident history:\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accident in the last five years.    \n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  In the event of an emergency, an incident command structure is established and HAWOPER Operations Level Responders act in a defensive manner.  The facility is a member of the South Brunswick Township Industrial Mutual Aid Council (SBIMAC) and coordinates programs and drills with the South Brunswick Office of Emergency Management and SBIMAC members.  Plant wide drills are completed annually.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nProcess safety is evaluated regularly and continuous improvements are implemented where feasible through conducting operational plant hazard reviews (OPHR). Annual risk reduction issues are evaluated and reflected via the facilities applicability to the NJ TCPA program."
