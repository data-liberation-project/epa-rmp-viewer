This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Jupiter Sulphur, Inc. (Jupiter Sulphur) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n    SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Facility is located in Kay County approximately one-fourth mile south of the intersection of Highway 60 and Highway 177 in Ponca City, Oklahoma. The Facility produces and distributes chemicals used in the agriculture and chemical market.  The facility has three plants (NaHS and Concentrate and ATS).  \n\nProduction at the Facility consists of the manufacturing of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), ammonium sulfide (AS concentrate), ammonium bisulfite (ABS), sodium hydrosulfide, and molten sulfur.  Anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, regulated substances, are integral to the above mentioned processes.  Ammonia is brought in by truck and stored in pressurized vessels.  Hydrogen sulfide is piped to the Facility from processes at an adjacent refinery.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment and piping.\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Jupiter Sulphur identified no listed flammable substances and two listed toxic regulated substances kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantity are presente"

Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Ponca City Facility has Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances at the Ponca City Facility. Therefore, analyses of flammable substances are not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case release of a toxic substance is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association. The ARP Program requirement for toxics, in a worst-case scenario,  assumes total quantity released in ten minutes.   Passive mitigation, such as diked areas, may be taken into consideration.  Additionally, administrative controls that reduce actual storage capacity can be also considered.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia using the EPA equations are presented in Table 2. Anhydrous ammonia has a worst-case toxic release of a 6.62 miles distance to the endpoint.\n\nTABLE 2\nDistance to Endpoint for Toxic Worst-Case Scenario\n\nChemical Name   Ammonia (anhydrous)\nOperating Storage Capacity (gallons) 25,500\n Weight (lbs)  131,325\nToxic Endpoint ERPG-2 (mg/L)  0.14\nDistance toERPG-2 (miles)   6.62\n\n\nAlternative Releases Scenarios\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely"

Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  The alternative release scenarios may also represent cases included in either the five-year accident history or hazard analysis of a facility.\n The following conditions may be considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\n7 Release rate dependent upon scenario;\n7 Use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source;\n7 Actual release height; and\n7 Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe Ponca City Facility does not have any regulated flammable substances held \non site.  Therefore, analyses of flammable substances are not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for the toxic substance above threshold quantity.\n\nThe three ammonia anhydrous tanks are connected to a common header pipe on the three-inch suction pump line.  The total length of piping is 49 feet.  A seal leak develops on the pump line that may eventually activate the excess flow valve at each tank, preventing the release of the entire contents of each tank.  The leak opening is estimated to be a maximum of 1/8-inch diameter before the excess flow valve will activate.  The release rate and duration were estimated.  A release rate of 1.17 pounds per minute (lbs/min) was developed.  The leak will continue a maximum of twelve hours before detection by employees and appropriate action is taken.  To be conservative, the alternative release scenario assumes that the total mass released is based on the 1/8-inch hole and twelve-hour release duration.\n\nThe total mass released, rele"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and adequate.  A PSSR verifies that a PHA has been conducted, recommendations have been resolved, and training of employees involved in the process has been completed prior to a start-up.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be kept. The basic aspects of this program are to include:\n\n7 training;\n7 developing written procedures;\n7 performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; \n7 correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and, \n7 applying quality assurance measures.  \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:\n \n7 an overview of the process; \n7 safety and health hazards; \n7 applicable maintenance procedures;\n7 emergency response plans and;\n7 applicable safe work practices. \n\nThis training is to help ens"

Quality assurance measures are to be incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nDuring construction of new processes all equipment to be installed is to be determined to be suitable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:  \n\n7 control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \n7 a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\n7 a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened, \n 7 a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and \n7 a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThere is a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any "

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor's employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe facility will promptly investigate (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation will be to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports will be maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team will be established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team will document its findings in a report.  \n\nThe report will include dates of incident and of investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, will develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ponca City Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

Ventilate contaminated areas.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Ponca City Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no incidents involving a release of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Procedure Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures. \n\nThe emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Facility. The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Facility is coordinated with the County LEPC.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire and police department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."
