      "SummaryText": "ARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCRRM's Coffeyville Refinery, located at North and Linden streets near Coffeyville, KS, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., gasolines, diesels, propane, and butane) from raw crude oil.  This plan has been prepared for hydrogen fluoride, NFPA 4 flammable mixtures, and propane and butanes that are either used or produced during the refining process.  Hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds are present in crude oil and produce sulfur dioxide when combusted.  These compounds are not stored above thresholds to be included in this plan, but hydrogen sulfide has been included as a general duty to inform the public.  The refining process consists of:\n\n1. Separation: Liquid hydrocarbons are distilled by heat and separate into gases, gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oils and heavier residual material.\n\n2. Conversion: There are three common conversion processes:\n\na. Cracking: This process breaks or cracks large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller \nones. This is done by thermal or catalytic cracking.\n\nb. Reforming: High temperatures and catalysts are used to rearrange the chemical \nstructure of a particular oil stream to improve its quality.\n\nc. Combining: Chemically combines two or more hydrocarbons such as liquid \npetroleum gas (LPG) materials to produce high-grade gasoline.\n\n3. Purification: Converts compounds to an easily removable or an acceptable form.\n\n4. Blending: Mixes combinations of hydrocarbon liquids to produce a final product(s).\n\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the \nCRRM Coffeyville Refinery. Processes at the refinery are subject to the EPA RMP regulation and OSHA PSM standard.\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\n\nCRRM maintains a variety of technical documents and standard operating procedures that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties"

      "SummaryText": " and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  This information addresses any known hazards associated with the use and handling of chemicals.  Safe operating limits and consequences of deviation have been established for processes.  The refinery ensures that processes are maintained within operating limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems.\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written operational procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in each process is not compromised.\n\n4.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n\nCRRM has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The refinery primarily uses the What-if/What-if Checklist technique to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The hazard and operability study (HAZOP) technique and What-if "

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team provides a risk ranking for all scenarios which have a credible safety or environmental consequence, and makes recommendations for scenarios with the highest risk rankings.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for review. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate \nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\nCRRM maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n4.4 Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, CRRM has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees are classified as trainees for the first 10 months of employment.  Trainees receive basic training in refinery operations, policies and safe work practices. The trainee will then complete curriculum specific to their assigned area to obtain Operator 3 level certification under the guidance of the area trainer.  The trainee will also learn and perform process-specific duties and tasks under the guidance of senior operators.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can independently perform all job tasks of an Operator 3.  Operators will progress through subsequent job levels in the same manner.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a competent level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n4.5 Mechanical Integrity\n\nCRRM has well-established practices and procedures in place to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedure"

In combination, these activities form a program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, the deficiency will be corrected before placing the equipment back into service or the deficiency will be corrected in a safe and timely manner while ensuring the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nPositive material identification (PMI) is used for piping and equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new piping and equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are completed.\n\n4.6 Management of Changes\n\nCRRM has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the cha"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n4.8 Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, CRRM conducts a compliance audit at least every three years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n4.9 Incident Investigation\n\nCRRM promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion or toxic gas release that could lead to personal injury, severe environmental impact, or major property damage.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, and are reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n4.10 Employee Participation\n\nCRRM encourages employees to participate in all elements of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees also form the Emergency Response Team (ERT).  Additional ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is documented in an employee participation plan. \n\n4.11 Hot Work Permit\n\nCRRM requires a Hot Work permit to be issued prior to performing hot work.  The permit process is part of the procedure to control spark-producing activities.  Additionally, the refinery has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n4.12 Contractors\n\nCRRM uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n5. SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM MEASURES\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Coffeyville Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized in the previous section is applied to all processes at the refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.  \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.

This incident had the potential to release the full contents of the contactor.  The incident was evaluated and determined not to be a RMP incident.   One RMP incident has occurred in the last five years.  An incident occurred December 28, 2010 when loss of containment of gas oil from the FCCU Fractionator resulted in a fire.  On-site impacts resulted from the incident, but there were no off-site impacts.  The incident was investigated and corrective actions developed to improve safety and prevent recurrence. \n\n\n\n7. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nCRRM maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for CRRM interfaces with plans developed by other local emergency response organizations.

In addition to participating in Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) meetings, CRRM conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  The refinery provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances that are present in the refinery. \n\n\n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSeveral changes have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the accidental release prevention programs.  All of the programs covered in this submittal are designed to facilitate change of unsafe situations, and to ensure that when changes are performed to the processes in the facility that they do not compromise safety, environment, equipment, or product quality.  CRRM is currently designing a change to be implemented in late 2011 that will reduce the inventory of hydrofluoric acid.  Additionally, the hydrofluoric acid storage area will be relocated and additional mitigation equipment will be added.  CRRM continues to evaluate and install emergency isolation valves to reduce the potential for loss of containment.  Additionally, CRRM is continuing to install dual seals on pumps to minimize potential for loss of containment from pump seal failure.  Process parameter alarms are being evaluated for prioritization and management to improve alarm acknowledgement and response.\n"
