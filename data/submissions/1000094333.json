              "Description": "Albertsons implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The program includes a regular preventative maintenance program (Mechanical Integrity)for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such assafe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may  be hired to work on the refrigeration system.  Albertsons has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Brea facility. Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental release of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Brea Distribution Center is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nBrea DC senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Albertsons has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nBrea DC was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations in place at the time of construction.  The facility is located at 200 North Puente in Brea, California.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. \n\n\n\nThe Brea DC uses anhydrous ammonia to provide refrigeration for cold storage operations. There are 2 systems. System #1 uses 42,200 pounds of ammonia and System #2 uses 47,000 pounds of "

      "SummaryText": "ammonia as a refrigerant within the closed systems, which operates continuously. Compressors and condenser cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  \n\n\n\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration equipment is located inside the two engine rooms. The condensers are mounted on the engine room roofs and the evaporators are placed in their respective dock or storage areas.  Access to the two engine rooms is limited to authorized personnel.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the suite of standards published by International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). In addition, the facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 regulation.  This included conducting an initial PHA to examine potential release scenarios and identify measures to reduce the consequences and/or likelihood of such events.  The PHA has been revalidated every five years.  The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investi"

This monitoring system is comprised of liquid level controls, pressure and temperature controls and indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility personnel to effectively monitor and control refrigeration operations. \n\n\n\nThe facility is equipped with ammonia gas detectors located in the Engine Rooms and in the warehouse. \n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on the EPA RMP coded definition of \"accident\", an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted on June 6, 2021, revealed that there have been no incidents that meet the EPA RMP definition criteria of \"accident\" in the last five years (June 2016 - June 2021).  \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency action plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility.

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger.  The facility plant manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, was conducted for the facility in 2016 with a revalidation scheduled summary 2021.  An independent Mechanical Integrity Inspection was also completed at this time and is also scheduled to be completed again in 2021.  These assessments provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Salt Lake DC facility. \n\n\n\nIn addition to these technical studies, the maintenance department and safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
