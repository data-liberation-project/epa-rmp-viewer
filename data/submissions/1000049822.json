We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. The SIC code for the operation is 5143; NAICS code is 42443. The facility has approximately 95 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, and 52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs., the refrigeration system exceeds this threshold.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  The system emergency shutdown is located outside the engine room and the maintenance office. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours. System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe Engineer/Assistant Engineer is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nAmmonia is the only s"

The prevention program consists of the following elements: \n\n?    Employee Participation Program\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?

Compliance Audit Procedures \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences. Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n\n \n\n Emergency Action Program \n\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures; section 302 & 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local Fire Department.  The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials. \n\nThe facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.\n\nA release of 100 lbs or more must be reported to the National Response Center, SERC, and LEPC in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nWe have identified 2 potential changes to improve the safety of our"
