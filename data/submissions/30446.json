      "SummaryText": "Pasco Beverage Company is a food manufacturer engaged in the blending and packaging of a variety of natural fruit drinks in\nconsumer-sized packages.  Located at the boundary between an industrial area and a residential area, the facility imports by truck a variety of juice concentrates and blends them into consumer products.  Packaging materials, and wrapping and shipping materials are also brought to the site.\n\nThe facility typically employs 76 workers, in a three-shift operation.  The plant is protected by a chain-link fence around the perimeter, and entry by vehicle is monitored by a security guard.  The plant faces other industrial and commercial buildings at both the front and the back of the facility.  \n\nThe raw materials are kept refrigerated prior to final blending, and are kept frozen after packaging.  They are shipped by truck to a number of locations for further distribution and consumer purchase.\n\nThe need to keep raw materials refrigerated and finished products frozen requires a large refrigeration capacity.   To supply the demand for this refrigeration capacity, Pasco Beverage operates an in-plant anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consisting of six compressors and a common receiver, with the associated piping systems which carry the refrigerant to the appropriate mixing, packaging, storage and warehouse areas.  This refrigeration plant was expanded and upgraded in 1995.\n\nPasco Beverage has long been committed to maintaining a high degree of employee safety and community relations.  To these ends, Pasco Beverage maintains an active safety management program to prevent releases of ammonia.  Pasco Beverage's overall approach to safety is the prevention of accidents, and emphasis on safe work practices.  A planned schedule of inspection and maintenance activities, augmented by worker training, is intended to prevent accidents and releases.  A system of automatic detection and alarm devices is employed to give early warning of releases, and these are i"

      "SummaryText": "ntegrated with off-site response providers, such as ADT, and the Chicago Fire Department.\n\nSenior mangement remains committed to this program of safety and safe procedures.  The implementation of safe working procedures and chemical safety is directed at the level of Vice President, who is responsible for corporate policy and facility compliance.\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's PSM rule, and maintains a written Process Safety Plan on-site.  The plan is augmented by an employee training program, and a program of regular inspections and scheduled maintenance.  There have been no accidents in the past 5 years.  \n\nPasco Beverage personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and situations which are minor repair/maintenance problems.  However, for major releases, the facility is integrated into the response plan of the local unit of the Chicago Fire Department.  Facility personnel are trained in response actions which consist of minimizing damage to the facility while assisting the orderly evacauation of all personnel.  Evacuation drills are conducted twice annually.\n\nPasco Beverage Company's program of regular review and update of the PSM and Emergency Response Plan, employee training, routine inspections and regular maintenance has produced an accident-free history.  The facility regularly evaluates and implements any appropriate measures to improve safety further."
