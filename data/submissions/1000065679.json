This vision will be achieved through the Gas Safety Excellence framework. The\n\nstrategy is to deliver Gas Safety Excellence by putting safety and people at the heart of everything;\n\ninvesting in the reliability and integrity of our gas system; and by continuously improving the\n\neffectiveness and affordability of our processes. Strategic actions developed under this strategy are\n\naligned under three elements of a safety management system that: (1) develop an asset management\n\nstrategy to appropriately invest in the integrity and reliability of the gas system; (2) nurture a safety&#8208;first\n\nculture that places safety at the heart of everything it does; and (3) focus on process safety in all\n\nactivities to minimize the possibility of high consequence events. PG&E has prepared an emergency\n\nresponse plan as an element of its Hazardous Materials Business Plan to handle potential accidental\n\nreleases of compressed natural gas.\n\n\n\nES&#8208;2 CNG Fueling Facility Description\n\nThe Manteca Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fueling Facility is located on the south side of W.

A residential area is situated east\n\nand north of the facility. A light industrial development is located to the northwest.\n\nThe CNG Fueling Facility consists of the following: utility meter set; gas dryer; fixed and portable\n\ncompressors to boost utility pipeline pressure of 30 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 2,400 to\n\n4,100 psig; three CNG storage vessels; fast&#8208;fill CNG dispenser; PLC based gas flow control equipment;\n\neight fill posts for filling portable CNG trailers; space for fueling of 17 portable CNG equipment trailers;\n\nm"
