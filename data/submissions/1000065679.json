This vision will be achieved through the Gas Safety Excellence framework. The\r\nstrategy is to deliver Gas Safety Excellence by putting safety and people at the heart of everything;\r\ninvesting in the reliability and integrity of our gas system; and by continuously improving the\r\neffectiveness and affordability of our processes. Strategic actions developed under this strategy are\r\naligned under three elements of a safety management system that: (1) develop an asset management\r\nstrategy to appropriately invest in the integrity and reliability of the gas system; (2) nurture a safety&#8208;first\r\nculture that places safety at the heart of everything it does; and (3) focus on process safety in all\r\nactivities to minimize the possibility of high consequence events. PG&E has prepared an emergency\r\nresponse plan as an element of its Hazardous Materials Business Plan to handle potential accidental\r\nreleases of compressed natural gas.\r\n\r\nES&#8208;2 CNG Fueling Facility Description\r\nThe Manteca Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fueling Facility is located on the south side of W.

A residential area is situated east\r\nand north of the facility. A light industrial development is located to the northwest.\r\nThe CNG Fueling Facility consists of the following: utility meter set; gas dryer; fixed and portable\r\ncompressors to boost utility pipeline pressure of 30 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 2,400 to\r\n4,100 psig; three CNG storage vessels; fast&#8208;fill CNG dispenser; PLC based gas flow control equipment;\r\neight fill posts for filling portable CNG trailers; space for fueling of 17 portable CNG equipment trailers;\r\nm"

The LNG/CNG South M&O\r\nSupervisor is also responsible for training staff involved in maintaining the system. Training records are\r\nmaintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nPG&E has implemented written Management of Change (MOC) procedures to manage changes to\r\nprocess technology, equipment, documentation and procedures and to the physical facility\r\ninfrastructure that might affect the CNG Fueling Facility. In the event that there is a change to the CNG\r\nFueling Facility other than replacement&#8208;in&#8208;kind, PG&E will evaluate the change, including the technical\r\nbasis, impact on safety and health, need for new/modified operating procedures, implementation\r\nschedule, and authorization requirements at which point a decision will be made on how to proceed.\r\nFacility staff with responsibilities affected by the change is informed of, and trained on, the change prior\r\nto startup and affected process safety information, operating procedures, and mechanical integrity\r\nprocedures are updated.\r\n\r\nPre&#8208;Startup Safety Review\r\nPG&E performed a pre&#8208;startup safety review (PSSR), using a PSSR checklist, when the CNG Fueling\r\nFacility was initially commissioned.
