This vision will be achieved through the Gas Safety Excellence framework. The\n\nstrategy is to deliver Gas Safety Excellence by putting safety and people at the heart of everything;\n\ninvesting in the reliability and integrity of our gas system; and by continuously improving the\n\neffectiveness and affordability of our processes. Strategic actions developed under this strategy are\n\naligned under three elements of a safety management system that: (1) develop an asset management\n\nstrategy to appropriately invest in the integrity and reliability of the gas system; (2) nurture a safety&#8208;first\n\nculture that places safety at the heart of everything it does; and (3) focus on process safety in all\n\nactivities to minimize the possibility of high consequence events. PG&E has prepared an emergency\n\nresponse plan as an element of its Hazardous Materials Business Plan to handle potential accidental\n\nreleases of compressed natural gas.\n\n\n\nES&#8208;2 CNG Fueling Facility Description\n\nThe Manteca Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fueling Facility is located on the south side of W. Yosemite\n\nAvenue, one mile west of the City of Manteca in San Joaquin, California. The City of Manteca\n\nWastewater Treatment Plant is located south and west of the facility. A residential area is situated east\n\nand north of the facility. A light industrial development is located to the northwest.\n\nThe CNG Fueling Facility consists of the following: utility meter set; gas dryer; fixed and portable\n\ncompressors to boost utility pipeline pressure of 30 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 2,400 to\n\n4,100 psig; three CNG storage vessels; fast&#8208;fill CNG dispenser; PLC based gas flow control equipment;\n\neight fill posts for filling portable CNG trailers; space for fueling of 17 portable CNG equipment trailers;\n\nm"
