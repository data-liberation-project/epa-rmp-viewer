      "SummaryText": "Southern Power Company's Plant Franklin consists of three combined cycle units, each equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for control of NOx emissions.  Corresponding to the three SCR systems are three identical, not connected, ammonia storage tanks.  The storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia is the process at Plant Franklin that is subject to RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nBased on EPA guidelines, the worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of one of the three 15,300 gallon (80,000 lbs) ammonia storage tanks.  Such a release would result in ammonia gas traveling approximately 3.3 miles before reaching its endpoint.  However, this type of failure is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the prevention program.  The alternative release scenario considers a release due to failure of a pressure relief valve.  In this scenario, ammonia gas would travel approximately 0.1 miles before reaching its endpoint. This distance shows that an alternative release would not leave the plant site and would not affect any public receptors. \n\n\n\nPlant Franklin has developed and implemented plant procedures and a Process Safety Plan that ensure safe handling of the chemical onsite.  This includes daily rounds and regular preventive maintenance of the ammonia system.  System maintenance is tracked through an electronic work order management system.  Only properly trained employees perform the work of loading the ammonia tanks.  An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and an outside emergency response contractor, KAM, INC. has been hired to repsond to site emergencies.\n\n\n\nThere have been no anhydrous ammonia releases at Plant Franklin."
