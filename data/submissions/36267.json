      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Aqueduct, is to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances through the use of proper equipment and procedures.  All equipment that is used on the chlorination system at the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is consistent with design criteria. All procedures for operating and maintaining equipment-handling chlorine are written and are regularly reviewed and revised as needed.  In addition, all personnel operating or maintaining chlorine-handling equipment are provided a high level of training.\n\nChlorine storage and feed areas are in enclosed buildings that contain multiple chlorine sensors.  In the event of a leak, these chlorine sensors provide an alarm to indicate to the operators that chlorine gas is at an elevated level in the building atmosphere.  In addition, these sensors are designed to activate the chlorine scrubber system in the event chlorine concentrations within the building exceed set thresholds.  Each separate chlorine area (storage and feed) contains its own scrubber system that is capable of scrubbing at least one ton of chlorine.\n\nIn the event that a substantial chlorine leak was to occur, specific Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond.  Personnel are trained to use personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), in order to address emergency situations in a safe manner.  In the event that a more serious leak was to occur than Dalecarlia personnel are able to address, local emergency responders would be contacted.  These local Hazmat personnel are coordinated with in advance as is required by the Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is located in Washington, D.C. at 5900 MacArthur Blvd, N.W., along the east bank of the Potomac River.  The plant rated capacity is 240 million gallons per day (MGD) and the average annual production of potable wa"

      "SummaryText": "ter is approximately 110 MGD.  At the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant, the Risk Management Program regulations are applicable to chlorine stored on site.  The amount of chlorine stored at the plant exceeds the 40 CFR Part 68 threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The storage facility at the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant includes 64 one-ton chlorine containers, which equates to 128,000 lbs. of chlorine.\n\nThe Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  An electronic gate opener monitors and controls access to the plant, which is surrounded by a security fence.  A security guard is stationed at the front gate to admit visitors and deliveries on a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week schedule.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios.  First is the worst-case release scenario.  For the worst-case release scenario, the EPA regulations specify that the greatest amount held in a single vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  At the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant, this would involve the release of a ton container of chlorine.  This is a very unlikely scenario.  The alternative release scenario is defined within the regulations as being more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario and to have a toxic endpoint off-site.  \n\nAs specified by the regulations, all active mitigation measures are assumed to not be working for the worst-case release scenario.  At the Dalecarlia facility, even if an event were to occur whereby a ton container were to be released, the scrubber in the storage area would prevent the release of chlorine gas to the environment.  Even in the event of a power outage, the on-site emergency generator would allow the scrubber to operate and remove the chlorine gas.  For both the worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, the toxic endpoint considered is the ERPG-2, which is three parts per million by volume.

      "SummaryText": "n defines this concentration as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?\n\nFor the worst-case release scenario, the atmospheric conditions as specified in the regulations are, stability class F, and wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  EPA-developed RMP*Comp software was used to calculate the distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles.  This calculation took into account passive mitigation for the fully enclosed building. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the fracture of a ?? pipe connection on a liquid chlorine feed line.  This could result from a pressure gage attached to the pipe being struck by a ton container being moved into the feed location.  The amount of chlorine released is estimated to be 1750 lbs. at an average rate of 70 lb/min for 25 minutes.  The distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint is estimated to be 0.1 miles.  Passive building mitigation was once again used to dampen the impact of the release.  However, it was also assumed that the building scrubber system was not operational.  As in the case for the worst-case release scenario above, this alternative release scenario is not very likely, since activation of the building scrubber system would render this type of release to be fully absorbed by the scrubber system.  The RMP*Comp software was again used to estimate the distance to an endpoint.  Meteorological conditions were assumed to be Stability Class D, with a wind speed of 3.0 m/s in the model.  These types of meteorological conditions are more typical than those assumed for the modeling of the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe general Washington Aqueduct accidental release prevention program for the Dalecarlia water treatment plant includes the following key elements:\n\nComprehensive training of operations and mainte"
