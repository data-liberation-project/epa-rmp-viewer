This committment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilitiy's primary activities encompass wholesale chemical distribution. We have six (6) regulated substances present at our facility. these substances include, Hydrofluoric Acid, Oleum, Cyclohexylamine, Ammonia >20%, Formaldehyde solutions, and Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of hydrofluoric acid at our facility is 126,000 lb., while oleum, cyclohexylamine, ammonia, formaldehyde and chlorine are present at our facility in quanties of 45,000 lb., 44,4550 lb., 23,490 lb., 22,200 lb. and 10,800 lb. respectively.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, Inckuding Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit Distances for each Reported Scenario\n\nTo perform offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorine storage and handling. In this scenario, 10,800 lb. of chlorine is released. The toxic liquid is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 11 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for oleum involves a release from oleum repackaging and handling. The scenario involves the release of 1246 lb. of oleum. Toxic liquid is "

Passive mitigation controls such as buildings are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.50 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde involves a release from formaldehyde repackaging and storage. The scenarion involves the release of 1363 lb. of formaldehyde. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as buildings and drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.28 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia >20% involves a release from ammonium hydroxide storage and handling. The scenario involves the release of 1179 lb. of ammonium hydroxide. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions the maximum distance of 0.19 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrofluoric acid 70% invloves a release from the storage tank. The scenario involves the release of 2908 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid. Toxic Liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated in 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario.

Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.06 miles is obtained.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
