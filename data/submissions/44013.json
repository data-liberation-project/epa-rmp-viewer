Copies of the written program are on file at the main office and may be obtained from Fred Pearson.\n\nUnder this program, you will be informed of the contents of the Hazard Communication Standard, the hazardous properties of products with which you work, safe handling procedures, and measures to take to protect yourselves from these products. You will also be informed of hazards associated with other tasks.\n\nList of Hazardous Chemicals\n\nManagement will make a list of all hazardous chemicals used in our facilities and will update the list as necessary. The list of chemicals identifies all of the chemicals used in our facilities.  A separate list is available for each work area and is posted in each specific work area. Each list also identifies the corresponding MSDS for each chemical. A master list of all chemicals will be maintained at the main office and is available from the program coordinator.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS\u00bfs)\n\nMSDS\u00bfs provide you with specific information on the chemicals we use at our facilities.

A master list of MSDS\u00bfs is available at the office.\n\nLabels and Other Forms of Warning\n\nManagement will ensure that all hazardous chemicals in the workplace are properly labeled and updated as necessary. Labels should list at least the chemical identity, appropriate hazard warnings, and the name and address of the manufacturer, importer or other responsible party. Management will refer to the corresponding MSDS to assist you in verifying label information. Containers that are shipped from the workplace will be checked by Management to make sure all containers are properly labeled.\n\nIf there are a number of stationary containers within a work area that have similar contents and hazards, signs will be posted on them to alert employees to hazard information.  On our stationary process equipment, regular process sheets, batch tickets, and similar written materials will be substituted for container labels when they contain the same information as labels.

A program that uses available materials has been prepared for this purpose. Whenever a new hazard is introduced, additional training will be provided.  Regular safety meetings will also be used to review the information presented in the initial training.

In addition, the coordinator will notify these individuals of the location and availability of MSDS\u00bfs. Each contractor bringing chemicals on-site must provide us with the appropriate hazard information on these substances, including the labels used and the precautionary measures to be taken in working with these chemicals.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAll employees, or their designated representatives, can obtain further information on this written program, the hazard communication standard, applicable MSDS\u00bfs, and chemical information lists from Management."
