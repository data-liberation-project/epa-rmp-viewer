Additionally, if a notification is made in response to an accidental release, this would also satisfy the notification requirement.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGill's Onions has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. Nevertheless, Gill's Onions continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM Program. This has improved Gill's Onions ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Gill's Onions management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM Program is being implemented.\n\nGill's Onions has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM Program. When a RMP-PSM Program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Gill's Onions has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM Program implementation.\n\nGill's Onions considers the RMP-PSM Program a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Gill's Onions employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM Program Gill's Onions will continue to maintain overall plant worker, public, and environmental safety."

The coordination records will include the names of individuals involved and their contact information (phone number, email address, and organizational affiliations), dates of coordination activities, and nature of coordination activities.\n\nThe disclosure of information classified or restricted by the Department of Defense or other Federal agencies or contractors of such agencies is controlled by applicable laws, regulations, or executive orders concerning the release of that classified or restricted information.\n\n1.5.2 Emergency Response Notification Exercises\n\nAt least once per calendar year, Gill's Onions will conduct an exercise of the facility\u0092s emergency response notifications mechanism.

Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nOn 9/16/2022 Gill's Onions had an accidental release of ammonia. The accident occurred at approximately 9pm. The accident occurred when a solenoid coil had grounded to plunger tube and burned hole on post causing liquid ammonia to leak. The release was determined to be caused by the malfunctioning solenoid valve. The duration of the release was estimated to be 6 hours 18 minutes. The amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 1,095.2 lb. The local CUPA, 911, CalOES, and the National Response Center were notified.\nAn investigation was performed and the following recommendations were made and are being resolved:\n\nRecommendation 1: During the emergency response, there was confusion as to which agencies were required to be notified and what order the notifications should be made. Train appropriate personnel responsible for making the release notifications on the appropriate agencies to be notified in the event of an ammonia release, order of notifications, and timeline to make such notifications.\n\nRecommendation 2: Due to the failure of a solenoid valve, a hole developed in the plunger for Coil 3 on the hot gas defrost line which led to an accidental release of ammonia. Ensure that the solenoid valve is replaced and that the system is safe prior to start-up.\nRecommendation 3: It has been determined that"

The RMP-PSM Program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\nFacility Overview\n\nGill's Onions operates a commercial cold storage for onions in Oxnard, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(1) Cold Storage Room\n(1) Shipping Vestibule\n(1) Pressure Cooler\n(2) Processing Areas\n(2) Packaging Areas\n(6) Plate Water Chillers\n\nFacility Location\n\nGill's Onions is located at 1051 Pacific Ave. Oxnard, CA 93030. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 34.191478, -119.165720. The facility is located approximately 1.5 miles west of state highway 1 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by businesses.\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \u0093an area of minimal flood hazard\u0094.\n\nGill's Onions is located within the Oxnard Alquist-Priolo Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation which is classified as a landslide and liquefaction zone. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed the following faults within close proximity:\n\nCalifornia Offshore: unspecified - <1,600,000 Years\nMcGrath Fault - <1,600,000 Years\nMontalvo Fault - <15,000 Years\nOak Ridge Fault - <15,000 Years\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Gill's Onions has a 2-5% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\nDescription of Covered Process\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators which are supplied from a recirculator as required for pumped overfeed operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access.

Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program \u0096 Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) \u0096 Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM Program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \u0093living document\u0094. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Gill's Onions has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Gill's Onions, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Gill's Onions has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:  \n\nProcess Name                     | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration     Anhydrous Ammonia        21,418\n\nOur RMP-PSM Program promotes overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as w"
