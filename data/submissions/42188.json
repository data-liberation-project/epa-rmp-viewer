The Water Treatment Plant complies with all requirements stipulated in EPA 40 CFR Part 68 \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Program\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\"  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine, uncontrolled reactions, or runaway reactions in the past five years.  The Utilities Department will continue it's ongoing safety training and maintenance programs to ensure proper operations at the facility.  The Utilities Department is also in the process of converting its disinfection chemical from chlorine gas to hypochlorite."
