Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nOur facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  This facility makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility receives and stores chemicals that are primarily used in the electronics and semiconductor industry.  The regulated substances arrive at the warehouse loading dock, are transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment without ever opening the containers.  The regulated substances handled are hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  This facility reported th"

Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite industrial/commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the drummed hydrochloric acid in an enclosed building.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide would only impact offsite industrial and commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distances reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the drummed hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide in an enclosed building.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  This facility's operations are ISO 9002 certified.  The management system procedures contained in the ISO program ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.

Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants and gain familiarity with our operations.\nOur facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.
