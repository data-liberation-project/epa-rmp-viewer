In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of Ammonia Refrigeration Process\r\n\r\nThe facility uses approximately 18,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for spiral freezing in three spirals freezers.  The majority of this system is located in an engine room (3 compressors) and o"

      "SummaryText": "utside and on the roof.\r\n\r\nThe pumps of the low temperature receivers pump the low temp liquid ammonia to the evaporators.  The compressors pull the low pressure ammonia vapor from the pump receivers where it is compressed into a high pressure vapor.  This vapor is then piped to the condenser, where the ammonia is converted back to high pressure liquid and recycled to the High Pressure Receiver.  The auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the High Pressure Receiver and the condensers.  \r\n\r\nThis facility also used approximately 2,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a second closed system. This system is located in a separate engine room with 2 compressors and 2 vessels. One condenser, pipes and valves are located on the roof.  This system is used to cool a secondary coolant, glycol, which cools process equipment in the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of Worst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nFailure of the high pressure receiver, the largest vessel onsite, containing 12,500 pounds (80%) of ammonia resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 3.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this state; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of Alternative Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a relief valve lifting to atmosphere.

Under neutral weather conditions, Class D atmospheric stability and wind speed of 3.0 m/s, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is .10 mile radius.  \r\n\r\nDescription of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidental release of ammonia, Rhodes Bake N Serv, Columbus complies with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68, ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere is no 5-year accident history.\r\n\r\nDescription of Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department."
