Wastewater from Hartford and several surrounding communities is treated at the HWPCF, and final effluent is discharged into the Connecticut River.  The wastewater treatment process includes preliminary screening, primary settling and treatment, secondary treatment and clarification, sludge processing, and chlorination of the final effluent before discharge.  The HWPCF handles wastewater flows averaging 60 million gallons per day.\n\n\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home and in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water and railways.  The natural world contains more than 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds.  Human cells generate hypochlorite, a form of chlorine, to fight infection.  Chlorine purifies our drinking water, disinfects our swimming pools and is truly life saving.  The HWPCF uses chemicals, too.  For example, they use chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharge to the environment.\n\n\n\nStoring and using chemicals can be hazardous if not done properly.  The HWPCF takes safety obligations in handling chemicals seriously.  MDC has used chlorine at the HWPCF for over 29 years without an accidental release.   MDC employees receive extensive on-going chlorine safety training.\n\n\n\nThis document summarizes MDC's existing safety system, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe HWPCF Risk Management Plan (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.

      "SummaryText": " Management Program requires facilities that use certain substances to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe HWPCF has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from chlorine one-ton containers.  Chlorine is stored in a quantity above the regulatory threshold (2,500 lbs.) at which a RMP is required.  The HPWCF has prepared a detailed and comprehensive Emergency Action Plan to handle any potential releases.  The Emergency Action Plan, along with the RMP program, describes what actions to take in the event of a release and how to prevent any releases from occurring.\n\n\n\nMDC is committed to protection its employees, the public, and the environment from any release of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  Throughout its history, MDC has had an excellent record in accident prevention.\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater prior to discharging it to the Connecticut River during the months of May through September.  The objective of chlorinating the wastewater is to destroy pathogenic microorganisms contained in the wastewater.  Wastewater disinfection prevents the spread of diseases and protects surface waters used for recreation and as a habitat for aquatic life.\n\n\n\nChlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable, but, like other chemicals, it is capable of combustion under certain circumstances.  It is also a respiratory irritant.  Exposure through inhalation or eye or skin contact can cause severe health problems.  The HWPCF has several safety systems that are a part of the chlorine system.  These safety systems, along with the Prevention Program described below, greatly reduce the possibility of a leak occurring.\n\n\n\nA chemical distributor delivers chlorine containers to the plant.  Chlorine is withdrawn from the one-ton containers and delivered to the chlorination process.  Eight chlor"

Other examples of safety systems include high and low has vacuum alarms.  Chlorine gas is delivered under vacuum.  If a leak were to occur in this piping, outside air would be drawn in to the piping rather than chlorine gas leaking out of the piping.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine containers are located inside a fenced area with a surveillance camera.  THe camera operates 24 hours each day during the chlorine season (May-September) and a color monitor is located in the control room, which is staffed 24 hours per day.  There are entry alarms on the gate and doors to the area.  MDC owns and keeps the following equipment on-site: self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA), response suits and a ton container repair kit.  Approximately 25 employees are trained in proper operation of the chlorine system.  They also receive extensive initial and annual safety training.  Drills are held annually, with the operators wearing SCBA and response suits.   The training for chlorine emergency response is in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).\n\n\n\nThe HWPCF's effluent discharge permit, administered by Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, requires the plant to chlorinate the wastewater effluent from May 1st through September 30th.  Other than the few weeks prior to, during and the few weeks after chlorine season, no chlorine is on-site.  A complete preventative maintenance program is administered on all chlorine piping and equipment.\n\n\n\nRMP Requirements\n\n\n\nThe RMP consists of three major parts.  The first part is the Hazard Assessment.  The Hazard Assessment is performed to determine the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public.  The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. "

      "SummaryText": " The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur.  Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan.  This document is therefore referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release could have on the public.  For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the has could travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by the release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, parks, and schools were identified.  The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios - a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case.\"\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe regulations require the development of a worst-case scenario based on conservative assumptions.  For example, it is required to assume that the entire contents of the largest single container of chlorine will be released over ten minutes.  This is unlikely to occur since the properties of chlorine would cause a freeze and thaw cycle to occur at the leak, which would slow the release.  In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes for aqueous substances can be considered when determining the distance a release could travel.  Passive mitigation, as defined, includes no mechanical, electrical, or human input.  However, in many scenarios mitigating the release by isolating the process could significantly reduce the amount released.  In addition, the worst-case scenario requires that conservative atmospheric conditions be assumed which results in a large area of impact.   These conservative assumptions were set by EPA to ensure public notification and local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the relea"

The container rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as a tornado.  This type of a catastrophic release is unlikely to occur.  The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The hazard assessment requires at determination of the \"toxic endpoint\", or distance from the point of release to a location at which the chemical concentration equals a certain concentration.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA-approved DEGADIS BREEZEHAZ+ model.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint of a release of chlorine as the farthest distance at which a receptor would experience a chlorine concentration of 3 parts per million (ppm).  The concentration at the circle surrounding the plant defines the boundary of the area that would be impacted by a release, and the concentration at the circle is 3 ppm.  If a leak were actually to occur, the vapor cloud would only travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, not in all directions around the facility.  The 3 ppm endpoint concentration is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentration defined as the maximum concentration at which most individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing irreversible or serous health effects.  Because the cloud from a leak of chlorine would disperse relatively quickly, an individual located at the toxic endpoint would be exposed to a chlorine concentration for much less than one hour.  It has been demonstrated, through EPA-approved DEGADIS BREEZEHAZ+ dispersion modeling, that an individual located at the toxic endpoint would be exposed to a chlorine concentration of approximately 3 ppm for only three to ten minutes compared to the ERPG-2 allowable exposure time "

The alternative scenarios reflect a type of release that is more likely to occur compared to the worst-case scenario.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as shutoff valves and a more realistic release quantity and release rate.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical or human input.  It assumes local, typical meteorology, which is more realistic than the conservative meteorological conditions that must be assumed for the worst-case scenario.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine modeled, using the EPA approved ALOHATM model, release through a 5/16-inch diameter vapor valve in the top of a horizontal tank and considered passive mitigation of an enclosure or building.  Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 175 pounds.  For the second alternative release scenario, the same modeling approach was used as for the worst-case scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to represent more realistic conditions.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for both alternative release scenarios indicate that these scenarios have a small offsite impact.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program together with the Emergency Response Program make up the RMP/PSM.  The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.

If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to the covered process, before work begins, an on-site contractor orientation on safe work practices, chlorine hazards, and the Emergency Action Plan is held, to make the contractor aware of the HWPCF's RMP/PSM plan requirements.  Prior to the commencement of work, the contractor will be presented with the Emergency Action Plan, Loss Control Procedures Manual, Line breaking procedure, and description of the chlorination process.  Prior to commencement of work, the contractor must certify in writing, and maintain records, that the contractors' employees working on or around the HWPCF chlorination facilities have successfully completed contractor training.
