Through training local emergency  \nresponders and employees.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work\nwith the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\nThe DeLong Co., is  a member of the Fertilizer 100.  Meaning they are one of the largest 100\nfertilizer dealers in the nation and one of the biggest in Wisconsin.  They employ more than 85\npeople company wide. There are actually five divisions in The DeLong Co., Inc. Chick DeLong\nis in charge of feed.  Bo DeLong is in charge of grain.  Dan DeLong is in charge of Delco\nTransport.  Steve Quade is in charge of the seed division.  David DeLong, President, is in charge\nof fertilizer and chemicals. The primary activity at the facility is the storage, distribution and\napplication of anhydrous ammonia for stateline area farmers. The maximum quantity stored\nwould be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled\nwould be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\nWORST - CASE\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of a storage tank or\ntank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 150,000\npounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent of capacity as\nlimited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1\nmiles.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or the most likely\npotential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point\nof dispersion to 200 ppm) is 01 miles.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety "

One person injured, none hospitalized. To our\nknowledge, there were no offsite deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, property damage or\nenvironmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe company has it's emergency response unit and team ready for any accidental releases of\nanhydrous ammonia plus a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29\nCFR 1191 D.38\n\nWe provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community sight-to-know\ninformation as required under Sara Title III EPCRA and  a written emergency response program in\naccordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.20 including pre-emergency planning and\nemployee training.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at The DeLong Co.
