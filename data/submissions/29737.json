      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOccidental Chemical Corporation\u00bfs Niagara Plant is located in Niagara Falls, NY manufactures chlorine and is subject to 40 CFR 68. The Niagara Plant originally submitted a Risk Management Plan (RMP) registration in June of 1999. This re- submission is an update, which reflects current conditions at the facility. \n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (\u00a7 68.155(a))\n\nOccidental Chemical Corporation has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Niagara Plant.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and the requirements of OSHA \u00bfs Process Safety Management Rule, 29CFR 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Niagara Plant.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a7 68.155(b))\n\nThe Niagara Plant handles one regulated substance that is covered by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  This substance is chlorine. The RMP threshold for chlorine is 2500 pounds. The largest storage vessel contains 1,200,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s) (\u00a7 68.155(c))\n\nWorst Case Scenario (Toxic Substances) - The worst-case release scenario for the Niagara Plant involves the release of 1,200,000 pounds of chlorine in a 10-minute period.  Using EPA\u00bfs methodology and information sources, there would be an offsite impact associated with this theoretical event. EPA\u00bfs Look \u00bf Up Tables were used for evaluating the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case sce"

      "FacilityID": 29737,
      "SummaryText": "nario. The RMP regulation states that only certain types of mitigation activities or plans can be considered under this scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (Toxic Substances) - The alternative release scenarios toxic substances involved the release of 447 pounds of chlorine in 10 seconds from a rupture of a one and one half inch loading hose. There are a number of safety /mitigation controls in place should a rupture of a loading hose occur. They include interlocks, remote emergency stop buttons, a derailer, motion detector, tankcar valve closer, and others aimed at limiting the release.  Chlorine detectors are also located in the manufacturing area.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for chlorine was determined to have an off-site impact.\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nThe Niagara Plant\u00bfs prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\tProcess Hazard Analysis\tOperating Procedures\nTraining\tMechanical Integrity\tManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Review\tCompliance Audits\tIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\tKey Procedures\tContractors\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manuals at the facility.  These manuals are routinely updated.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History (\u00a7 68.155(e))\n There was one incident that occurred in August 6, 2000 that resulted in approximately a 1-pound gas release to the atmosphere and gas inhalations to two millwrights working on a process line. No offsite impacts or damages. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program (\u00a7 68.155(f))\n\nThe Niagara Plant has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (\u00bfERT\u00bf) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills a"
