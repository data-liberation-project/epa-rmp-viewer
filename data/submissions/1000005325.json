The Facility Policy\n\n   The owners, management and employees of Centra Sota Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n   The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\n   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n   This facility has developed a worst case and alternative case scenario, however, it has been witheld from this executive summary as security sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". In addition, Minnesota Deptartment of Ag Rules.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accorda"
