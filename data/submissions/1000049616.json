As part of analyzing events at other plants within the company, Huntsman is taking steps to drive our Process Safety Management program far beyond that which is required for simple compliance.  Over the past decade within Huntsman we have forged a corporate EHS program based upon our EHS policy, underpinned by the EHS Responsible Care Standards and associated procedures. We place great value on process safety, personal safety and care for the environment. The Huntsman EHS Vision is that we provide innovative solutions which enrich lives and help create a sustainable future, with no harm to people or to the environment.

      "SummaryText": "THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Huntsman Advanced Materials McIntosh plant (Huntsman) is located on Huntsman Road in McIntosh, Washington County, Alabama.  Huntsman occupies the northeast quadrant of the manufacturing area that was formally Ciba Specialties Chemicals Corporation (now owned by BASF), prior to purchase by Huntsman, and is operating with approximately 160  employees. We maintain a staff of Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) professionals who are trained/educated in their respective areas and provide professional training to our employees.  Huntsman strives to be an accepted part of the community by being a good citizen.  We focus daily on all laws and regulations in order to protect the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment.    \r\n\r\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nHuntsman produces specialty polymers and basic liquid epoxy resins.  As part of the manufacturing process, we utilize one chemical listed in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program rule above the threshold quantity, epichlorohydrin.  Epichlorohydrin is received in rail cars and tank trucks, and then transferred to storage tanks on site.  From the on-site storage tanks, epichlorohydrin is piped to several processing areas, where it is reacted with other chemicals to form epoxy resins.  \r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nOur facility is subject to two major chemical accident prevention rules:\r\n- The USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, found at 40 CFR 68, and;\r\n\r\n- The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule found at 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program is applicable due to both flammable and toxic materials above the PSM threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nCompliance with these regulations is integral to Huntsman's efforts to reduce the"

This information helps us to ensure the on-going safety of process equipment.\r\n\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A multidisciplinary team of Huntsman personnel, with or without the assistance of external professional consultants,  analyze our process to determine potential release scenarios and the potential consequences of these scenarios.  The team then evaluates existing safeguards in place referencing process safety information and the knowledge and experience of team members.  The risk of each scenario is ranked according to likelihood and severity.  The team decides if existing safeguards are adequate and if not, a recommendation for improvement is developed.  Recommendations are tracked to completion.  All associates and applicable contractors have access to the results of the PHA.\r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures.  We have developed written safe operating procedures for the process.  These procedures include: initial start-up; normal start-up and shutdown; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdowns and operations; start-up following normal or emergency shutdown or major change; consequences of deviation from normal operations; and equipment inspections.  All of our operating personnel are part of an on-going training program for operating procedures.\r\n\r\n- Mechanical Integrity. We have implemented a program to inspect and maintain all critical components of the process covered by RMP and PSM.  This program utilizes the manufacturer's recommended operations and maintenance procedures, good engineering practice, and our own maintenance experience, to regularly inspect and assess t"

We have implemented a system to ensure that any changes to the process are analyzed for potential hazards associated with a change.  This system also helps us to ensure that our program is current.  Before we start a new process, or after a significant change to the system, we complete a formal pre-startup safety review.\r\n\r\n- Incident Investigation.  We review  all incidents and \"near miss\" incidents.  Our reviews  allow us to learn more about the process to prevent recurrence or similar incidents.  We review the results of our investigation with associates and contractors, if involved.\r\n\r\n- Contractors.  We recognize that contractors or visitors may not be familiar with the hazards of our process.  To help assure the safety of our associates, visitors and contractors, we have implemented a contractor safety program whereby contractors are pre-qualified, informed as to the hazards, and periodically evaluated while on site. \r\n\r\n- Safety Systems.  Our process has been equipped with certain safety systems intended to prevent, or minimize the effects of a release.  Examples of these systems are: pressure relief valves, automatic level controls and interlocks and alarms.  Experienced operators continuously monitor the process and are trained to respond to potential process upsets. The process is equipped with automatic fire protection systems including sprinklers, deluge systems and foam systems.  We also have written emergency response procedures, in case the system approaches unsafe limits.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nHuntsman has had one accident in the last five years involving an RMP chemical resulting in an injury to onsite personnel.\r\n\r\nDATE and TIME: Monday, September 16, 2013  13:41\r\nNAICS CODE: 325211 (Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing)\r\nRELEASE DURATION: Less than 5 minutes\r\nCHEMICAL: Epichlorohydrin\r\nQUANTITY REL"

      "SummaryText": "EASED: Minimal, less than 5 pounds\r\nRELEASE EVENT: P-014 canned motor pump explosion with a subsequent flash fire \r\nRELEASE SOURCE: McIntosh A-12 (BLR) tank farm pump P-014 used with V-3700 epichlorohydrin distillates tank. \r\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: Mostly cloudy, 91\u00b0F, 47% humidity, 10 mile visibility, winds ENE at 6 mph, pressure 30.05 in.\r\n\r\nON-SITE IMPACTS: The pump exploded on the motor end.  The electrical head was blown off the canned motor pump case into the air and a flash fire occurred.  The majority of the fire went out on its own; a small remaining flame in the pump dike was put out with a fire extinguisher.  The injured associate sustained burns on the back of his left hand, his left forearm, upper chest, and lower portion of his face and was immediately put under the safety shower.  He received first aid basic treatment by the Site Emergency Response organization and was transported to a hospital with burn treatment facilities for further treatment.\r\nKNOWN OFFSITE IMPACTS: none\r\nINITIATING EVENT: Catastrophic rear bushing failure caused P-014 rotor to fail and breach the can resulting in the leakage of epichlorohydrin into the stator compartment.\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTING FACTORS: \r\nFor re-starting the pump, the motor thermostat was by-passed.  Site practice did not recognize the thermostat as a safety device. Distributed Control System (DCS) history indicated there had been a repeating malfunction in the pump control circuit for 2 days.  Although the electronic bearing indicator did not detect failure, the rear bearing was destroyed and the rotor was rubbing the can leading to process fluid leaking into the stator compartment of the pump motor thus providing fuel for the explosion.  Alarms identifying that the equipment was in and out of malfunction were not effectively communicated to the console operator, hence this information was not transferred to the maintenance personnel. The DCS programming was set to continue calling for the pump to run regardless of pump"

      "SummaryText": "malfunctions. The P-014 breaker was defective and did not trip at the proper current setting to protect the pump. V-3700 distillate tank level reading was higher than actual level in the tank. This may have contributed to drawing solids from the bottom of the tank into the P-014 pump, contributing to bushing/bearing wear.\r\nRoutine pump maintenance procedures were not consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations (periodic inspection and fault clearing).\r\n\r\nOFFSITE RESPONDERS NOTIFIED: Only medical Site Emergency Response was called. The small quantity release of epichlorohydrin did not warrant any additional offsite response action. \r\n\r\nCHANGES INTRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT:\r\n1.  Site personnel evaluated why the Bearing Electronic Monitor did not indicate a problem with the bearings and developed further actions as appropriate.\r\n2.  An automated Alarm and shutdown with required response by operators for multiple pump malfunctions has been developed and implemented over an established time frame for canned motor pumps in chemical service.  Also, a plan and schedule has been developed for similar indication/response for other critical motors. \r\n3.  In addition to checking motor bearing indicators, a Preventative Maintenance program has been developed for canned motor pumps based on manufacturer's recommendations and plant history, including consideration of missing or bypassed motor thermostats. \r\n4.  A troubleshooting guide has been implemented for canned motor pumps that includes consideration of the following examples when the pump is in chemical service.\r\n     \u00bf\tIsolate and drain the process fluid from the pump before troubleshooting electrical or mechanical malfunctions.\r\n     \u00bf\tIf motor thermal overloads are routinely kicking the motor off then the pump should be removed from service and overhauled.\r\n     \u00bf\tIf pump breaker or current overloads are tripping then the pump should be removed from service and overhauled.\r\n     \u00bf\tIf the control circuit f"

      "SummaryText": "use is blown because the motor thermostats are shorted out then pump and motor should be removed from service and overhauled.\r\n     \u00bf\tChecking \"T\" leads to assure motor windings are not shorted to ground prior to placing the pump and motor back in service. \r\n5.  V-3700 low level interlocks on circulation and transfer pumps has been improved, considering suction head requirements compared to tank level and potential residue in tank. \r\n6.  V-3700 is removed from service and cleaned periodically to eliminate the possible buildup of residue in the tank to keep residue from contributing to the failure of the pump bearings.   \r\n7.  All impacted personnel have been re-trained on the site Safety Device Out of Service Procedure requirements with emphasis on what constitutes a safety device and management expectations for determining appropriate alternative protective measures when a device is out of service and equipment is to be operated.\r\n\r\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe are a defensive responder to releases of hazardous materials.  We have developed and implemented an emergency action plan, which details the steps we take in an emergency.  This plan specifies that we summon emergency services in case of a release.  A trained HAZMAT team will respond to the release, and our associates will evacuate to a safe area.  The Local Area Planning Commission (LEPC) is familiar with our Risk Management Plan, and will arrange for notification of the public, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nWe continually strive to improve the safety of our operations through regular audits along with suggestions and observations from employees.  EHS improvements are made whenever an incident investigation indicates the need for improvement, or a PHA team feels improvements are necessary. In addition, \"near-miss\" reporting is stressed. Investigations using root cause analysis are conducted to uncover conditions leading up to incidents. A Behavioral Based Safety observation"
