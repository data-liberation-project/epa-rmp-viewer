This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The NCP ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of natural gasoline (denaturant), a regulated flammable mixture, above the respective threshold quantity. This RMP submittal is to meet the five (5) year submission requirements of the EPA Title 40 Part 68 requirements for the facility.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies [68.155(a)] NCP is committed to protecting the environment and operating facility in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, NCP has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous\r\nmaterials. \r\n\r\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the EAP is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of materi"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled [68.155(b)] The NCP facility is a 44 million gallon per year corn-based dry-mill undenatured ethanol fuel production facility. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a fermentation and continuous distillation process. Regulated substances stored at the facility include natural gasoline which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product. \r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [68.155(c)] NCP has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol and natural gasoline (denaturant).\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\nNCP has developed an employee participation program. All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and\r\nrecords of management of change are available to the operating personnel at any time.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\r\nThe facility utilizes the HAZOP (Hazard Operability Study) PHA methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, over-pressurization, corrosion, over-filling and equipment failure. The facility utilizes process controls such\r\nas vents, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases. NCP maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility."

Changes are reviewed to ensure that\r\nadequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nNCP has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of an RMP regulated substance. The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program\r\nin order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\r\n \r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe facility performs regular compliance audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audit includes a review of documentation and process safety information,\r\ninspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History [68.155(d)]\r\nThe facility had a single reportable incident concerning the RMP regulated process, resulting from a mechanical failure. The incident was contained within the appropriately designed containment system.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program [68.155(e)]\r\nNCP maintains a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The intent of the EAP is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The EAP addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for\r\nexposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and po"

NCP works with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of the Plan. The Emergency Action Plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes, management practices, and/or procedures.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety [68.155(f)]\r\nThe NCP facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements. NCP will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility."
