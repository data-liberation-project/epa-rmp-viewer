(AMPI) located in Rochester, Minnesota is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Associated Milk Producers Inc. facility processes food products, primarily cheese.  AMPI has on site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for employee comfort.  AMPI is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nAMPI has a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in an amount greater than the threshold under the Risk Management Program (RMP) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) according to Section 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and safe work practices.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe AMPI  ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed. Staff is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe e"

A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition. Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\r\n\r\nAMPI is equipped with an ammonia detection system with sensors located in the engine room and throughout the facility as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history (October 2009 - October 2014), there was one incident that resulted in \"significant property damage (approximately $150,000). This incident occurred on June 19, 2013 and involved a small leak (approximately 39 pounds) from a back pressure regulator.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAMPI has established an Emergency Response Program that provides for trained personnel on call in the event of a release.  AMPI is also coordinated with the Olmsted County HazMat team and City of Rochester Fire Department.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release, we would immediately notify our affected employees, call 911, Olmsted County HazMat team and City of Rochester Fire Department.\r\nPlant ammonia trained personnel will initiate emergency shutdown procedures. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific regulated substance safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
