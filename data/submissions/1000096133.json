The Emergency\r\nResponse Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Boardman Foods' PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nBoardman Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification\r\nprocedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan\r\nis reviewed and updated as needed to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nBoardman Foods has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Boardman Fire Department through the Morrow County Emergency Dispatch. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Boardman Foods to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nBoardman Foods is located at 71320 East Columbia, in Boardman, Oregon. The facility is approximately 0.28 miles north of Highway 84. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of industrial and very light commercial and residential areas west of the facility.\r\n\r\nBoardman Foods began facility operations in 1992 and plans to exceed 10,000 pounds of ammonia late December 2017. The facility uses approximately 16,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low"

The ammonia system at Boardman Foods consists primarily of vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators and associated piping. The majority of the equipment is located inside the Engine Room. The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective refrigerated areas.\r\n\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Boardman Foods' ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and through the refrigerated areas. The ammonia sensors will activate the audible and visual alarms. \r\n\r\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would shut down due to power loss. \r\n\r\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line. In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to the atmosphere until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves. This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions. The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator. The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases. Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis conducted on October 4-5"

Nor have there been any releases that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBoardman Foods facility has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility. The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. The facility is non-responding. Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Boardman Fire Department and the Morrow County Emergency Dispatch and the local fire houses. In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments. Other responders will be called as needed, including the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Oregon State Emergency Spill Reporting Center will be called.\r\n\r\nThe plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. The plan is reviewed and updated as necessary. \r\n\r\nBoardman Foods will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees and will coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on October 4-5, 2017 to satisfy the five year update requirements.
