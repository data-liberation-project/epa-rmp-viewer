The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.  \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1 (i.e. Storage and Handling) equipment includes (2) 48,000-gallon stationary storage tanks; (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank; and ancillary pump, piping, and valves.  Trained Facility personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to commercial tanker trucks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.  \n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a contractor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tanks. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The Contractor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Contractor.\n\n\n\n",

The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the MPR operations.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (HCC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at the Burkburnett Facility, Burkburnett, TX.  At this Facility, HCC engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use HCC's products to support agricultural operations.  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Burkburnett Facility located approximately 2 miles northwest of Burkburnett, TX at 2202 South Red River Expressway, Burkburnett, TX 76354.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Burkburnett Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Burkburnett Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHCC is submitting this plan as a 5-year update.  All applicable sections of the PSM/RMP have been addressed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at the Burkburnett Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Burkburnett Facility stores and handles one covered chemical (anhydrous ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA.  Two (2) covered processes are operated at this Facility and they include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Storage & Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\n\n\n\nThe Burkburn"

      "SummaryText": "ett Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by commercial tanker truck (9,600-gallon).  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to one of three (3) stationary storage tanks.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.\n\n\n\nAt this Facility, anhydrous ammonia is loaded out into the stationary storage tanks for storage.  The Facility either loads out to commercial tanker truck for bulk delivery to other facilities or is loaded out to a mobile pipe reactor (MPR) for the blending of ammonium polyphosphate.  When loading out to commercial tanker truck, trained Facility personnel perform the transfer.\n\n\n\nWhen blending ammonium polyphosphate, the anhydrous ammonia is blended with water and phosphoric acid.  Ammonium polyphosphate is a liquid fertilizer that is used by farmers on a seasonal basis.  Covered process equipment used in this process includes a stationary storage tank for the storage of the anhydrous ammonia and a MPR.  The stationary storage tank is owned by HCC, and the MPR is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  When the IFRC arrives to the Facility, the Facility transfers the responsibility of the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary storage tank to the IFRC.  At this point, the IFRC connects the MPR to the stationary storage tank with transfer hoses.  When the IFRC is complete with its operations, the IFRC transfers the responsibility for the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary storage tank back to the Facility.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage process and the fertilizer blending process.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the ammonia storage and the blending process because the largest vessel (i.e. a 48,000-gallon stationary storage tank) is common to both of the covered processes when connected.  The worst case scenario release for the Burkburnett Facility"

      "SummaryText": " was modeled as if the 48,000-gallon stationary storage tank was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are the same for the two processes.  For the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  For the fertilizer blending process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the blending process.  Mitigation equipment involved in this alternative scenario includes excess flow valves and emergency shutoff valves, and operating procedures that the Facility and the IFRC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Office Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Office Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Office Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Operators are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.  \n\n\n\nThe Office Manager is responsible for managing the IFRC in accordance with the Contractor PSM/RMP requirements.  However, the IFRC is responsible for ensuring that its Operators are properly trained in the implementation of its OSHA PSM accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHCC's Burkburnett Facility is a non-respondin"
