Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThis is a water production facility in the process the handling of chlorine is required (chlorine is considered hazardous by the EPA).  The same properties that make chlorine a valuable commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulation.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on recommendations from the Chlorine Institute including procedures for the notification of all necessary agencies and potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce potable water for public consumption, in which chlorine gas is used for the purpose of water disinfection.  The chlorine is stored in Department of transportation (DOT) approved containers and is injected into the water through equipment which meets ASTM Standards.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 4000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a one ton cylinder of chlorine would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l (3ppm) is 1.3 miles, as dete"

      "SummaryText": "rmined by the RMP*COMP modeling program.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - A one ton cylinder of chlorine is puncture with contents being released as a vapor.  The endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is 0.3 miles, as determined by the RMP*COMP modeling program.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility complies with all Federal and state regulation.  This facility is also operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute, and Texas A&M's Engineering Extension Services.  All equipment is regularly serviced by equipment suppliers authorized personnel along with the continued training of all personnel that work with the equipment.\n\n5. Five-year accident history\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is in conjunction with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Alvin Fire Department.  It involves the notification of all agencies involved and notification of all potentially affected neighbors.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nOptions are currently being researched for alternatives to using chlorine gas in the disinfection of potable water."
