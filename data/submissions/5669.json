To comply with the\nrequirements in 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the\nCITY OF FORT WORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk\nManagement Program (RMProgram) for the VCWWTP including Management\nSystem, Hazard Assessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the\nemployee and public risk of injury, death or damage from accidental\nrelease of chemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Assistant Director\nC.   RMProgram Manager\nD.

Storage, transfer and use of sulfur dioxide in dechlorination\n     system\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in three (3) side-by-side\ntanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine inventory in each\ntank is 44,000 lbs.   The maximum process quantity is 132,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\nSulfur Dioxide gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in two (2) side-\nby-side tanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine inventory in\neach tank is 44,000 lbs.   The maximum process quantity is 88,000\nlbs., ignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\n3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment has been completed for the VCWWTP.  Offsite\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\nprinciple elements:\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for chlorine\n     and sulfur dioxide worst-case scenarios.  A leak from a liquid\n     line near the outdoor storage tank was assumed for either\n     chlorine or sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario.\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in worst-case scenarios. \n     The excess flow valve, however, was considered for either\n     chlorine or sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario.\n\nD.   Distances to toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide\n     worst-case scenarios were modeled using a dense gas dispersion\n     model, DEGADIS.\n\nE.

Distance to the flammable endpoint for methane scenario was\n     determined using a TNT-equivalent model.\n\nG.   Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n     scenario.\n\nThe accidental release of sulfur dioxide from a storage tank is\nconsidered the worst-case scenario. A distance of 5.3 miles between\nthe release source and the toxic endpoint was modeled in the offsite\nconsequence analysis.  The alternative scenario impact distance is 1.3\nmiles for sulfur dioxide and 1.2 miles for chlorine.\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, LANDVIEW III estimated a population of\n220,000 persons within the worst-case scenario impact radius of 5.3\nmiles.  Populations are 5,400 and 3,300 persons for sulfur dioxide and\nchlorine alternative release scenarios, respectively.\n\nPublic receptors within the worst-case scenario impact area include\nschools, residences, hospitals, correctional facilities, recreation\nareas and commercial, office, or industrial areas.  Public receptors\nwithin the alternate release scenario impact area are schools,\nresidences, recreation areas and commercial, office, or industrial\nareas.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.
