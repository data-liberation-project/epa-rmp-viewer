      "SummaryText": "RMP 2004 Executive Summary\n\nAbout KapStone\nKapStone Charleston Kraft LLC (KapStone) is a major manufacturer of paper, and employs nearly 1100 people in the North Charleston Mill. Our paper mill in North Charleston manufactures unbleached paper used to make decorative laminates for surfaces like kitchen countertops and office furniture.  Our high-strength paperboard is also used in the manufacture of a variety of familiar food containers and drink cartons.  In addition, KapStone's lumber mill produces framing lumber and construction timbers.\nEfficient use of all resources is a trademark of kapStone operations.  Natural by-products of the papermaking process are the raw materials for specialty chemical products manufactured by MeadWestvaco at its North Charleston Specialty Chemical Division facilities adjacent to KapStone. These specialty chemical products are used in the manufacture of a variety of goods like rubber and plastics, soaps, asphalt, textile dyes and printing inks.\nKapStone is unequivocally committed to total compliance with environmental, safety and health regulations.\n\nKapStone and Chlorine\nKapStone uses chlorine in 90-ton rail cars to treat water before it is used in the papermaking process.  Prior to use, the chlorine rail cars are staged on a separate track referred to as the Haz-Mat track.\n\nAt low concentrations chlorine is commonly used to make solvents, disinfectants and chlorine bleach cleaners.\nExposure to chlorine can cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can damage the lungs and cause a buildup of fluid which can be life-threatening.\nProtection of the health and safety of our employees and residents of our communities is our highest priority.  When we handle chlorine, we make every effort to safeguard people and the environment.  Multiple safeguards are in place to ensure that we handle chlorine safely. We also work closely with other members of our industry, local officials and the public to maintai"

MeadWestvaco?s commitment to the safe transportation, storage and handling of chlorine prevented any accidents in the past five years of chlorine handling operations.\nEmergency Response\nKapStone has plans in place for handling emergencies -- fires and natural disasters as well as chemical incidents.  First and foremost, our goal in any chemical incident is to contain any release as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on the facility and its neighbors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If an incident occurs:\n* Automatic safety valves close quickly to seal off chlorine supply;\n* Plant alarms will sound, the emergency communicated to all site personnel over the mill-wide alert system and emergency response teams will be activated;\n* KapStone Environmental Services personnel will be alerted, and if necessary, perform computer modeling to estimate area affected by release; and\n* North Charleston Fire Department will activate local and county response teams if needed.\n\nTraining and Preparation\nKapStone trains employees on safe handling of chlorine and prepare to respond appropriately to incidents should they occur.  This training and preparation includes:\n* Trained and qualified emergency response teams composed of KapStone employees are on-site around the clock take pr"

New mitigation and control technologies are thoroughly reviewed for effectiveness and applicability to our process.\n\nManaging Risks\nAs part of our commitment to comply with the laws and regulations of local, state and federal agencies, KapStone has developed a risk management plan under the guidelines established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under these guidelines, facilities that handle specific quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of certain chemical releases and outline the measures taken to reduce the risk and minimize the effects of these releases.  \n\nIn an effort to minimize risks further, KapStone plans to eliminate chlorine from the North Charleston facility by the end of 2008."
