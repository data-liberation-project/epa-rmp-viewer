This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nGRP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  GRP's Emigrant Trail Gas Plant has coordinated with the Lyman Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant is located approximately 17 miles southwest of the town of Granger, Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant is a 60 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/day) cryogenic natural gas processing plant. Input to the plant includes sweet wellstream gas.  The plant produces a mixed natural gas liquids (NGL) stream of 2,860 barrels per day maximum.\r\n\r\nAt the Emigrant Trail Gas Plant, the gas first is routed to an amine contactor to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) while in ethane recovery mode (not used while in ethane rejection mode), then to mol-sieve dehydration beds for final moisture removal. The gas enters a turboexpander and demethanizer tower, where the mixed NGL product is removed. The gas from the demethanizer is recompressed by the Cooper-Bessemer engines up to sales line pressure and sold down the pipeline.  Natural gas liquids from the processing train are sent to pressurized storage tanks to await shipment via pipeline or truck to sales markets. \r\n\r\nThese substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  GRP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nGRP employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
