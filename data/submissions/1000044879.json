The steam is used for enhanced oil recovery and a portion of the electrical power is consumed by Chevron, while all surplus power is sold to the local utility. An aqueous ammonia process was added to the existing Cogeneration Plant and was started up in 2nd quarter 2000. The ammonia reduces the amount of nitrogen oxides (Nox) in the flue gas, which is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor in the flue gas just prior to exposure to a catalyst. The resultant chemical reaction reduces the Nox to harmless nitrogen and water. The aqueous ammonia that is used is a 20% or greater concentration. The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia at the facility is above EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities, and above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/RESPONSE POLICY\n\n                         \n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. It is our policy at the Eastridge Cogeneration Facility "

Policy 530 states that the Company will conduct scientific hazards assessments, as needed, to identify, characterize, and safely manage any potential hazards of company operations. In addition policy 530 outlines a number of management practices covering all facets of company operations and attainment definitions describing compliance. \n\n\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The covered process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n \n\nThe plant als"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n \n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility primarily uses the Process Hazard Analysis technique to manage process hazards and risks. The PHA methodology is recognized to be a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest "

Theses periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown (4) normal shutdown, (5) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

In addition, all operators periodically review the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\n\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has well-established practices and procedures in place to properly maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, control systems, electrical systems, rotating equipment, and emergency shutdown systems. Maintenance procedures are based on manufacturers' recommendations, recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, and maintenance history. \n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nChevron periodically conducts inspections and audits of our facilities, including the Eastridge Cogeneraton Facility, to determine whether the procedures and practices required to operate these facilities safely are in place.
