Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Ammonia Aqueous 30%, Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70%.\n \nListed below are the way the two RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n1. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 31,740 lbs.\n\n2. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Hydrofluoric Acid onsite at any one time will be 13,860 lbs.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the \nLook-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RMP substances in inventory onsite. Each RMP liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.

Listed below are the maximum distances in miles and the corresponding toxic endpoint of mg/L for each individual RMP substance inventoried onsite using the above conditions. For each Alternate Release Scenario onsite Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment were considered for active mitigation. RMP COMP software was used for modeling purposes.\n\n1. Worse Case Scenario release of 690 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of .1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L.\n\n2. Worse Case Scenario release of 385 lbs Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, the maximum distance of .1miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .016 mg/L.\n\n3. Alternate Case Scenario release of 55 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of <0.1 miles is obtained using Class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.\n\n4. Alternate Case Scenario release of 250 lbs Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained using Class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.        \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
