The last RMP was submitted June 22, 2009.\n\n\n\nAt the Nalco Champion Freeport Plant, we are committed to operating and to maintaining our process in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Managemet Program (the RMP rule).  One element of the RMP rule is a Risk Managemet Plan (RMPlan) which details accident prevention measures and safeguards.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk managemt program.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are vital to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.  The Nalco Champion Freeport Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances we use.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained responders will act to control and contain the release.  We work with local emergency response organizations to evaluate potential releases and to formulate appropriate responses to contain and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of such a release.  Nalco Champion in conjunction with the local emergency planning and response organizations, has established a means to warn the surrounding communities in the event of a release which would threaten the public.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNalco Champion operates a manufacturing facility at the Freeport site in Brazoria County, Texas.  This batch-process facility produces a wide variety of ma"

For the purpose of this RMPlan, the use of EO and PO is considered as one process for our site.\n\n\n\nProgram Level:  3;  Regulated Substance:  Ethylene Oxide;  Type:  Toxic\n\nProgram Level:  3;  Regulated Substance:  Propylene Oxide;  Type:  Toxic\n\nProgram Level:  3;  Regulated Substance:  Formaldehyde;  Type:  Toxic\n\nProgram Level:  3;  Regulated Substance:  Methylamine;  Type:  Flammable\n\nProgram Level:  3;  Regulated Substance:  Carbon Disulfide;  Type:  Toxic\n\n\n\n3.  Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nThis section has been left blank based on the EPA Amendment to the RMP rule on April 9, 2004 (69CFR18819).\n\n\n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccident prevention is our top priority and a vital part of our business.  A number of programs are in place at our facility to prevent accidental releases and to ensure safe operation.  These programs include:\n\n\n\n-  Process Safety Information\n\n-  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-  Incident Reporting and Investigation\n\n-  Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n-  Training Program\n\n-  Emergency Response\n\n-  Standard Operating Procedures\n\n-  Critical Safe Work Permitting System\n\n-  Management of Change System\n\n-  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n-  Contractor Safety Program\n\n-  Compliance Audit Program\n\n-  Employee Participation"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, this facility has experienced one (1) accidental release.  This accidental release resulted in the release of 150 lbs. of ethylene oxide.  There were no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or off-site, or any evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOur facility maintains an emergency response and contingency plan, which meets all of the federal, state and local regulatory requirements and is communicated to all employees.  This plan and the emergency response training for the site personnel provide protection for our employees, the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of our facility are active members of Brazosport's Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group, the Brazoria County Petrochemical Council (BCPC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Brazosport Emergency Planning Committee (BEPC).

      "SummaryText": "ll of these groups work to improve the communication between the chemical companies about emergency response and mitigation.  Furthermore, we share information to better enable us to protect our workers, communities and environment and to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\nRegular drills involving on-site emergency responders, the local fire department and the local industrial mutual aid team are conducted.  These drills are based on scenarios of fires, explosions and/or toxic releases and may involve any or all of the above response organizations.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe following improvements were identified during Process Hazard Analysis at our facility:\n\n\n\nImprovements already completed include:\n\n\n\n1.)  Review of relief systems for adequacy and change as necessary to handle worst emergency case.\n\n2.)  Addition of more alarms and reviews of set points of existing alarms for adequacy.\n\n3.)  Addition of more instrumentation to better monitor process conditions at more points along the process train.\n\n4.)  Installation of back-flow prevention measures to avert hazardous contamination or mixing of incompatible chemicals.\n\n5.)  Revision of standard operation procedures to clarify process steps and to eliminate possible confusion or error.\n\n6.)  Established a mechanical integrity and preventin maintenance program to monitor critical equipment and instrumentation and to minimize unforseen failures.\n\n7.)  Updated all plant drawings to reflect equipment and piping changes to provide an accurate tool for site personnel.\n\n8.)  Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analyses have been compleeted to meet the five year revalidation frequency per OSHA.\n\n9.)  Implementation of Safety Instrumented Systems program.\n\n10.)  Increase employee awareness through additional training.\n\n\n\nPlanned improvements include:\n\n\n\n1.)  Further automation of process equipment to minimize the opportunity for human error.\n\n2.)  Addition of more instrumentation to allow for clo"
