Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the propane terminal facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.

The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.  Operating procedures available at the facility do not meet Enterprise standards for completeness.  The Enterprise Training Department is working with the terminal supervisor to prepare a new set of accurate and complete operating procedures.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Apex Propane Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the facility.  New employees receive basic training in equipment and process flows, tank car unloading, and LPG truck loading operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the propane terminal facility has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety"

Within this program, the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The results of one previous process hazard analyses conducted by the previous owner are not available at the terminal.  Once sufficient safety information and accurate drawings are completed, Enterprise will conduct a thorough PHA revalidation review of the design of the Apex Storage and Terminal facility.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Ente"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Apex Propane Terminal facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel will periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal is implementing practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps insure that new equipment is suitable for i"

Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal currently utilizes an emergency procedure which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in the emergency procedures, and they are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Propane Terminal facility.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n \n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal is currently in the process of updating the written emergency response procedures.  Once prepared, the overall emergency procedure program will be coordinated with the Wake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Apex Propane Terminal has instituted necessary around-the-clock communication"
