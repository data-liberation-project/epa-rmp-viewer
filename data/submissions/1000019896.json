Each of these elements are components of the sites PSM Program summarized below.\n\n3a. Process Safety Information\n\nWritten Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained for the MEK and PDA Units by the plant's Engineering and safety Departments. The information compiled includes:\n\na) Data on the safe use and handling of Ammonia and Propane (e.g. Material Safety Data Sheets);\nb) Data on the process technology (e.g. process flow diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates, storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of the consequences of deviation);\nc) Data on the equipment used in the process (e.g. piping and instrument diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, and design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards).\n\nPSI for the MEK and PDA Units were generated before and during the Process Hazard Analyses for the process that use Ammonia and Propane. This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to indentify and understand the potential hazards associated with the process. These PSI also include the following information.\nA) Corrosivity data\nb)  Thermal and chemical stability data\nc) Ventilation system design data\nd) Design codes and standards employed\ne) Material and energy balances\nf) Safety systems.\n\n3b.

Safe Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for all processes at the facility, including those using Ammonia and Propane. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant. Procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy.\n\nSpecific information and instructions covered by operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemcial-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems. Written Safety procedures are also provided for specific operations such as Hot Work, Lock-out / Tag-out, Confined Space Entry and Line Breaking.\n\n3d. Training\n\nEmployees involved in operating processes using Ammonia and Propane have received training to ensure they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the requirements specified in the written Operating Procedures. Refresher training is provided every three years at a minimum, or sooner if warranted by changes to operating conditions, equipment or procedures. If refresher training is required more frequently than every three years, it will be triggered through the Management of Change process (described below). Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted, the material covered by the training, and the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\n3e.

In some cases, equipment inspections are drvien by permit requirements as well as the Mechanical Integrity program.\n\n3f. Management of Change (MOC)\n\nA Management of Change form is generated when there is a change ( except for replacement in kind) to equipment, process chemicals, technology, procedures, or a change to the facility that will affect a process that handles Ammonia or Propane. Work orders for such changes pass through the Safety Department and Engineering to ensure the proposed change is carefully evaluated before implementation (e.g. to assure that proper materials of construction and good engineering practices are employed). Engineering will make changes to the P&ID's to keep the Process Safety Information up to date. Operations and Maintenance personnel are trained prior to start up of a modified process.\n\n3g. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nPrior to start up of a new or newly modified process involving Ammonia or Propane, a Pre-Startup Safety review is conducted. The review is to ensure that the equipment and installation meets design specifications, a Process Hazard Analysis has been completed, employee training has been completed, and safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place.\n\n3h.

The incident investigation starts with the completion of an Incident Investigation Report prepared by the supervisor on duty at the time of the incident. The report is distributed to the plant Management Team and plant personnel. The Incident Investigation Team is made up of employees having experience and knowledge of the processes affected by the incident, and knowledge of incident investigations.\n\nFollowing the incident investigation, a report is prepared to include the following information:\n\na) date, time, and location of the incident;\nb) employee(s) involved in the incident, and their roles;\nc) date of the incident investigation;\nd) names of the employees on the incident investigation team;\ne) description of the incident, including chronology of events;\nf) root causes and contributing causes, including conditions at the time of the incident, and;\ng) recommendations to prevent recurrence.\n\nFollow-up actions, that are taken as a result of the recommendations in the incident investigation report, are documented and records of the reports and follow-up actions are maintained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n3j.

Under the program, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations in the Ammonia and Propane units. The hot work permit indicates the type and method of hot work to be conducted, the equipment that the hot work will be performed on, the date, time, and location authorized for the hot work, the presence of fire prevention and protection systems meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and signatures of the supervisory employees authorizing the hot work. A separate Hot Work permit must be issued for each Hot Work operation, and a separate Hot Work permit must be issued for each day. A copy of the Hot Work permit must be displayed at the job location while hot work is in progress, and the permit is maintained on file after the completion of the Hot Work.\n\n3l. Contractors\n\nPrior to retaining contractor services (eg: Maintenance) for work in the Ammonia and Propane units at the IWI Farmers Valley Plant, the contractors safety program and performance are evaluated.

Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible to ensure that each contractor employee performs the assigned  work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation. If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site. Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dismissal from the site.\n\nThese elements all form components of the site's PSM Program.
