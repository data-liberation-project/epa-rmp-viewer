The PHA systematically evaluates each process for potential hazards and then recommends change where needed.  These PHAs are revalidated every five years.\n\nThe PHA team is selected from management and employees.   Members are chosen based on their knowledge in operating and maintaining the process and engineering expertise.\n\nThe Smiley Hub considers a variety of factors when conducting the PHA using a combination of the \"What if\" and HAZOP methods for evaluating potential hazards.  Some of the factors considered are:\n 1.  Process Safety Information (PSI).\n 2.  Cause and Effects.\n 3.  Human factors.\n 4.  Public health.\n 5.  Environmental factors.\n 6.  Safeguards in place.\n 7.  Facility siting.\n 8.  Incidents, accidents and near miss reports.\n 9.  Management of Change (MoC) information.\n10.  All previous PHAs.\n\nThe results of the PHAs are published and made available to all personnel.  The PHA follow-up items are promptly addressed based on their priority ranking.  The responses to the PHA recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Smiley Hub retains these records of previously PHAs. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Smiley Hub maintains easily obtainable operating procedures that address various aspects of the process.  These procedures cover normal startup, startup after turnaround, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown.  In addition, the procedures list operating limits, consequence of deviations and responses, safety and health concerns and  safety systems.

      "SummaryText": "o provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Smiley Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\n\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to diagnose and repair the process equipment.  They must demonstrate a proficiency in their field of maintenance.  Only after the foreman of their discipline deems them competent, will they be allowed to perform maintenance tasks on process equipme"

Like the Operators, maintenance personnel receive ongoing training in their field and a formal refresher every three years.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Smiley Hub uses contractors to supplement its workforce for construction, maintenance and testing.  To ensure that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Smiley personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.  Contractors must maintain an acceptable score on these reviews to continue working at the facility.  In addition, the Safety Group reviews the contractor's written safety program, its implementation, training and accident history to ensure that it complies with the Smiley Hub requirements.\n\nThe Smiley Hub provides contractors with:\n 1.  A process overview\n 2.  Safety orientation and ensures their understanding through testing.\n 3.  Information about health and safety hazards.\n 4.  Emergency evacuation procedures and mustering location.\n 5.  All site specific safe work practices.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Smiley Hub conducted a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) before commencing initial process operations.  The records of those PSSRs are maintained at the facility.  In addition a PSSR is conducted anytime a change is made that effects the Process Safety Information or before startup after a turnaround.  The records of those PSSRs are maintained as part of the MOC process.  Smiley uses a standardized corporate PSSR checklist.  The PSSR serves to ensure that:\n 1.  Appropriate training has been conducted.\n 2.  Equipment, instruments, safety equipment and other elements are properly installed.\n 3.  Valves and controls are in the normal/safe position.\n 4.  Compressors and process equipment have been prep"
