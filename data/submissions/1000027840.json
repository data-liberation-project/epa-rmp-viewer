The system is completely under vacuum. If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a spring loaded valve on each of the regulators immediately closes to stop the flow of chlorine gas. The chlorine storage system is monitored by two independent leak detection systems. \n\nListed below is a brief description of BTMUA's risk management program as it pertains to the location detailed above.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n1. The goal of BTMUA's Risk Management Program (RMP) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine. BTMUA's delineation of this RMP element details responsibilities which involve Directors and Supervisors.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n2. BTMUA's RMP includes chlorine information on its toxicity, physical data, permissible exposure limits, reactivity data, corrosivity data, and thermal and chemical stability data. Information concerning the chlorination process chemistry, maximum inventory, safe upper and lower limits for temperature, pressures and flows or compositions, evaluation of consequences of deviations, piping and instrumentation diagram, materials of construction, electrical classification, ventilation system design, design codes and standards, safety systems, electrical one-line diagram, site plan, fire and sewer water system piping diagrams and external forces and events data are included in this element. The Director of Water Quality has overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this RMP element in conjunction with the Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor and the Director of Compliance, Safety & GIS.\n\n\n"

BTMUA has conducted Chlorination Process Hazard Analysis to identify, evaluate and control the risk associated with the hazards of the chlorination process. Process Hazard Analysis Documentation includes analysis reports, dispersion modeling reports, action timetables and a record of meetings held in which process hazard analysis results are communicated. The Director of Water Quality implements the PHA planning in coordination with the Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor and the Director of Compliance, Safety & GIS. These PHA's are conducted and thoroughly reviewed and revalidated at least every five (5) years following the completion of the initial report by an in-house hazard analysis team.\n\n\n\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP'S)\n\n4. The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure that BTMUA maintains up-to-date accurate, written SOP's that provide clear instructions for our chlorination system. All procedures will contain simplified operating instructions as well as any attachments. These procedures are reviewed annually to certify that they accurately reflect current operating practice. Any revisions to SOP's that include changes in our process chemical, technology and equipment and facility changes will be addressed in our management of change. The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor has overall responsibility for implementing this element in coordination with the Director of Compliance, Safety & GIS.\n\n\n\nEXTRAORDINARILY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE (EHS) OPERATOR TRAINING\n\n5. The purpose of this RMP element is to ensure that BTMUA employees who work on or near the chlorination system process are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and what appropriate response actions to take in case of an accidental chlorine release. This training consists of classroom and hands-on formats. Refresher training is given periodically throughout the year based on regulatory requirem"

The BTMUA PM Program identifies the direct and indirect EHS equipment as well as establishing, following and maintaining maintenance, inspection and testing schedules for this equipment. The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor has the overall responsibility for implementing this RMP Element.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n7. The purpose of this RMP is to ensure that BTMUA's chlorination process system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications. This is to determine that these changes can be accomplished safely and the chlorination system is ready to operate safely in accordance with original system design intent following the implementation of the change. Included in this element is document review, PHA development, employee training and record keeping.

This audit is completed annually under the direction of the Director of Water Quality in coordination with the Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor, and the Director of Compliance, Safety & GIS.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n10. All chlorine leak accidents or potentially catastrophic events at the Authority will be promptly investigated. The purpose of the accident investigation element is to identify the underlying causes of an accident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the accident from reoccurring. The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for initiating this RMP element and ensures that any resulting corrective actions are addressed and documented.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PLAN\n\n11. BTMUA recognizes that it is essential to involve its employees in the development and implementation of an OSHA PSM and EPA/TCPA RMP.

Additionally, in 2008 a Water Treatment Facilities study was completed to evaluate modification/expansion of the Water Treatment Plant which included evaluation of alternatives to the use of chlorine gas. BTMUA is currently planning to phase out the use of chlorine gas within the next five years.\n\n?Based on recent worldwide terroristic threats, acts and plans, a vulnerability assessment of the Authority's entire operation including an evaluation of the Authority's chlorine supply handling and storage procedures has been undertaken. In 2008, an update to the Authority's initial Vulnerability Assessment was conducted to ensure the continued security of the facility. This review was conducted by a consultant specializing in water utilities security and applicable Authority representatives including staff from the water treatment facility. The assessment was completed in the fall of 2008 and selected recommendations have been incorporated to protect personnel, property and the integrity of the chlorination system. Also, the Authority is actively researching and identifying security concerns in its operations through comprehensive risk assessments utilizing guidance from various agencies of the Federal and New Jersey State governments and will address all those that are within the scope of financial and "
