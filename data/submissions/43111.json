The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and sage work practices.\n\nDFA-Goshen has established an Emergency Response Program that provides employee training on proper response procedures to an emergency in the event of a release. DFA-Goshen is coordinated with the Goshen Fire Department and the Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  DFA-Goshen has an excellent safety record in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia.\n\nFacility Information\nThe DFA-Goshen facility processes and packages dairy related products.
