The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for no impact facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\r\n\r\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tUse of regulated substances in threshold quantities\r\n\u00bf\tImpact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\r\n\u00bf\tNorth American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\r\n\u00bf\tFive-year accident history\r\n\u00bf\tOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119 applicability\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant is regulated under Program 3 requirements under the applicability criteria of \u00a768.10 because:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIt stores a Propane Mixture (CAS 74-98-6) in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).\r\n\u00bf\tA release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (e.g. residence).\r\n\u00bf\tIt is subject to OSHA PSM because Propane is a flammable gas/liquid which is stored above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and the facility is planned to be normally occupied.\r\n\r\nElements required by USEPA 40 CFR 68 Subparts B through H for Program 3 are presented in Sections 2 through 10 of this document and the Appendices.\r\n\r\n1.1\t\u00a768.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nLinn Energy and the Chisholm Trail Plant have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.

The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances. The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Chisholm Trail Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is the NGL (propane) Tank, which contains a flammable mixture of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), primarily propane \r\n\r\nThis vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity. In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Chisholm Trail Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\n1.3\t\u00a768.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nP"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPerform their work in a safe manner;\r\n\u00bf\tHave the appropriate knowledge and skills;\r\n\u00bf\tAre aware of the hazards in their workplace;\r\n\u00bf\tUnderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\r\n\u00bf\tUnderstand and follow site safety rules; and \r\n\u00bf\tInform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA process overview;\r\n\u00bf\tInformation about safety and health hazards;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plan requirements; and\r\n\u00bf\tSafe work practices prior to their beginning work. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Chisholm Trail Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performa"

Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tConducting training:\r\n\u00bf\tDeveloping written procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPerforming inspections and tests;\r\n\u00bf\tCorrecting identified deficiencies; and\r\n\u00bf\tApplying quality assurance measures. \r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on the following to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess overview;\r\n\u00bf\tSafety and health hazards;\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable maintenance procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plans; and\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable safe work practices.\r\n\r\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Chisholm Trail Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tControl of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tA lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tA procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened;\r\n\u00bf\tA permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and\r\n\u00bf\tA permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. \r\n\r\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to en"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Chisholm Trail Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are trac"
