(Plumrose USA) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by Plumrose USA personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n(b)\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nPlumrose USA provides employment for approximately 350 workers in Council Bluffs, Iowa. This facility is a meat processing plant owned by Danish Crown, Randers, Denmark. The corporate headquarters are at Plumrose USA, Inc., P. O. Box 1066, East Brunswick, New Jersey 08816.\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Plumrose USA receives raw meat in the form of pork bellies and other raw meat (pork and turkey). Plumrose USA processes the raw meat into bacon and sliced meat. The pork bellies are washed, smoked, sliced and packaged as bacon.  Other raw meat, such as pork and turkey meat are processed by washing, grinding, mixing with spices, and cooking. Some of the cooked meat is smoked, sliced and packaged on site, while the balance is shipped off site for further processing. From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n(c)\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Preve"

The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Ammonia refrigeration process. This process safety information will include information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration process. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \u00bf Plumrose USA will update and revalidate the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA will be conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and will be performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system will be established to promptly address the team\u00bfs findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions. \n\nOperating Procedures \u00bf Plumrose USA will develop and implement written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized.

Plumrose USA will certify annually that these operating procedures are current and accurate. Plumrose USA will develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the Plumrose USA facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining \u00bf Plumrose USA provides training for each employee associated with the Ammonia refrigeration process. This training includes an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined by 40 CFR 68.54. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary.
