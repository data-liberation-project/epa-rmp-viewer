              "Description": "The Solar Grade Silicon. facility at Moses Lake, Washington contains two interconnected production units and an adjacent silane module storage area which are treated as one \"process\" for RMP submittal.  The company prevention program applies to the entire source which includes both NAICS codes.  Note that this facility is covered by 29 CFR 1910.119, so most dates indicated below are of the most recent review/revision of the item, and not necessarily the date first in compliance.  The last PHA conducted was for a portion of the process, and thus the \"major hazards identified\", \"process controls in use\",  \"mitigation systems in use\" and \"changes since the last PHA or PHA update\" only reflect those considered in the last PHA.   Additional major hazards identified for other portions of the process include: \"toxic release\", \"corrosion\", \"overfilling\", \"loss of cooling, heating, electricity, instrument air\".   Additional process controls identified for other portions of the process include:  \"scrubbers\", and \"rupture discs\".  Additional mitigation systems identifed for other portions of the process include: \"sprinkler system\", \"water curtain\", \"neutralization\", and in the \"other\" section, the inclusion of \"halon and carbon dioxide fire supression systems\", \"portable foam systems\", and \"portable containment/storage devices\" .  Additional monitoring/detection systems identified for other portions of the process include \"closed circuit TV cameras\" in the \"other\" section.  Changes since the last PHA or PHA update for other portions of the process include \"installation of process controls\".  Note that in all cases, \"major hazards\" were identified as those hazards possible in the absence of process controls, test and inspection programs, and mitigation systems.",

      "SummaryText": "Facility Information\n\nSolar Grade Silicon (SGS) Moses Lake, Washington facility is a manufacturer of silane and polycrystalline silicon for the electronics industry.  SGS occupies an 80-acre plot, which is located 5 miles east of Moses Lake, Washington on Road \"N\" NE.  The neighborhood is predominantly agricultural with several food processing plants, another chemical manufacturing facility, an industrial gas cylinder filling facility and a corrugated cardboard production plant in the vicinity.\n\nProcess Overview \n\nThe SGS facility in Moses Lake, WA is comprised of two different production units: 1) Silane, 2) Poly Reaction.\n\nThe Silane Unit, through a series of chemical reactions and separation steps, converts metallurgical silicon and hydrogen to a high purity silane gas.  Intermediates produced in the process are trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane.  Some of the silane is packaged in tube trailers and modules and temporarily stored prior to sale.  The Poly Reaction Unit uses the majority of the silane and converts it into hydrogen and polycrystalline silicon.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Silane Unit. \n\nThere is one covered \"process\" as defined by the RMP regulations at the Moses Lake facility.  This process includes the Silane and Poly Reaction production areas which are interconnected, and the silane module storage area located adjacent to the Silane production area. Together these areas are identified as the Polysilicon Manufacturing process.\n\nThis risk management plan uses \"predictive filing\" to account for variables in the total quantities of chemicals at the facility, and for planned changes to the facility.  With predictive filing, the maximum quantity of chemicals that would be in the process at any one time is specified in this plan.\n\nChemicals: \n\nSolar Grade Silicon has identified the following chemicals and maximum on-site quantities, which trigger compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) standards, 40 CFR Part 68:\n\nTrichlorosilane  200,"

      "SummaryText": "000 pounds\nSilane  300,000 pounds\nDichlorosilane  25,000 pounds\nHydrogen  9,100 pounds\n\nHydrogen is also included in the plan, though the maximum quantity on site is less that the regulated threshold of 10,000 pounds.  All RMP applicable chemicals at the source are classified as flammables. \n\nIn addition to the above RMP-covered chemicals, Solar Grade Silicon has identified other potentially hazardous chemicals which could have either onsite or offsite impacts.  Risks from both these non RMP-covered chemicals as well as the RMP-covered chemicals are minimized using similar design standards, procedures, controls, mitigation measures, and emergency response procedures.   Solar Grade Silicon is also working with the local Department of Emergency Management and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to coordinate emergency planning and emergency response for all potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios:\n\nFour hypothetical worst-case scenarios were identified and developed for the facility in accordance with RMP standards:\n\nThe full hydrogen storage tank releases its entire contents, 8,500 pounds of hydrogen, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.23 miles.  Public receptors within that radius are cultivated and uncultivated fields, and an industrial gas cylinder filling facility normally occupied by 2 persons during the day.\n\nA full high-pressure silane storage tank releases its entire contents, 20,000 pounds of silane, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.22 miles.  Public receptors within that radius are cultivated and uncultivated fields, and an industrial gas cylinder filling facility normally occupied by 2 persons during the day.\n\nA full liquid silane storage tank releases its entire contents, 22,000 pounds of silane, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.

Public receptors within that radius are cultivated and uncultivated fields with no population.\n\nA polycrystalline silicon furnace releases its entire contents of hydrogen and silane, totaling 38 pounds, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.04 miles.  Public receptors within that radius are an employee picnic area with approximately 6 persons in the area for 1 hour per day.\n\nAlternative Scenarios\n\nTwo hypothetical alternative scenarios were identified and developed for the facility in accordance with RMP standards:\n\nA silane tube trailer safety device fails and releases the entire tube contents, 1700 pounds of silane, the contents of the gas jet (73 pounds) explodes with 100% efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.07 miles.  Public receptors within that radius are cultivated and uncultivated fields with no population.  This scenario was selected as it was the only alternative scenario with off-site impact.\n\nA hose transferring trichlorosilane from a process vessel fails and releases the entire vessel contents of 230 pounds of trichlorosilane, which explodes with 3% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.02 miles.  There are no public receptors, only on-site impact.  The conservative efficiency selection of 3% was based on published literature indicating  an efficiency of 2% is typical for vapor cloud explosions. \n\nAccident History\n\nIn the past five years Solar Grade Silicon (previous Advanced Silicon) has experienced 5 accidental releases as defined by the RMP standards.  The largest was a release of 80 pounds hydrogen and 6200 pounds trichlorosilane on 10/8/98, which caused significant on-site impacts.  Off-site, this resulted in property and crop damage, and several residents were advised to shelter in place.   The other 4 accidental releases only "
