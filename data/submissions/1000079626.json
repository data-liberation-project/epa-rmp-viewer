ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nO.K. Foods has established programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community, the surrounding environment and to protect property assets.  Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  O.K. Foods strives to prevent potential releases through training and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures.  \n\n\n\nOK Foods emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  Working in conjunction with the Fort Smith Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is the processing of poultry products, in which one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used above the threshold level.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our the main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\n\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nTwo worst case scenarios have been chosen.  The first worst-case scenario for this facility involves the release of 8,995 pounds of ammonia from the largest high-pressure receiver located outdoors."

Foods has determined that the Plant 2 receiver to be the source of the worst-case release.   \n\n\n\n?    Toxic endpoint = 1.2 miles\n\n?    Population affected = 7,741\n\n\n\nThe second worst case scenario involves a 10-minute release at a rate of 919 pounds/min from the largest vessel, which is a 16,711 pound re-circulator located indoors.  Even though the vessel is located indoors, this scenario was also chosen as a \"worst case,\" since it is the largest vessel.  \n\n\n\n?    The Toxic endpoint = 1.2 miles\n\n?    Population affected = 7,741\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Scenarios (endpoints based on RMP*Comp; population from MARPLOT)\n\n\n\nThe five (5) alternative scenarios identified in 68.28(b)(2) were considered and are summarized here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n (i.)    Receiving vessel leak of 8,995 pounds over 60 minutes\n\na.    Toxic endpoint distance = 0.1 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 0\n\n(ii.)    Transfer hose failure and tanker truck (24,000 pounds) outside over 60 minutes.\n\na.    Toxic endpoint = 0.2 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 195\n\n(iii.)    Pipe leak (10,773 pounds) outside the plant over 60 minutes\n\na.    Toxic endpoint 0.1 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 0 \n\n(iv.)    Vessel leak (54,263 pounds) in the plant over 60 minutes\n\na.    Toxic endpoint = 0.2 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 195\n\n(v.)    Ruptured disk/relief valve failure, 81,000 pounds released outside the plant over 240 minutes\n\na.    Toxic endpoint = 0.1 miles\n\nb.    Population affected = 0\n\n\n\nScenario (iv.) is considered by the O.K. Foods Process Safety Committee as being the most likely to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nO.K. Foods reported an incident July 15, 2018, in which eighty-nine (89) pounds of ammonia was released into the engine room when an isolation valve failed during the replacement of a high-level switch on re-ci"

The NRC, local fire department and ADEM were notified of the incident prior to calculating the amount of ammonia released as a precaution.  \n\n\n\n5. THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nOK Foods RMP program use outside entities or organizations including the Sebastian County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n\n6. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOK Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  All personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Maintenance and Refrigeration operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are required to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.\n\n\n\n7. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOK Foods works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  Periodically meetings are conducted to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.  \n\n\n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOK Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  The Process Safety Management Program is reviewed and updated annually, which improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  \n\n \n\n"
