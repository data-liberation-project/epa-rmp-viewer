Mark Schwanbeck, General Manager - Phone 507-864-7733\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Elevator Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.

Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 145,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupationsl Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition,  Minnesota Dept. of Ag Rules.\n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History\n\na.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The Emergency Repsonse Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA stand"
