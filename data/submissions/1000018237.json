      "SummaryText": "Schwan places a high priority on chemical safety.  The corporate environmental manager is assigned responsibility for ammonia refrigeration safety.  All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain 3-shift coverage of emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level.\n\nThis facility is a cold storage warehouse/distribution center of frozen pizza.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, with a system inventory of 9,800 pounds.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios are calculated using RPM*comp and urban conditions.  The worst case scenario was based on the vessel that holds largest quantity of ammonia (-20 Recirculator Vessel V-3).  The alternate release scenario was based 1/8\" irregular hole it a liquid supply line.\n\nThe refrigeration system is under the threshold quantity required by EPA RMP rule 40 CFR Part 68.130 and OSHA PSM rule 29CFR 1910.119.  These rules were used to develop a ammonia refrigeration management program.\n\nThis is a new facility that has not experienced a release.\n\nThe emergency response team has about 65 members, all trained at the 24-hour technician level by the corporate environmental compliance manager or by Private Contractor.  Training emphas ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, protective equipment including use of level a suits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS).  Emergency plans are filed with the local fire department and annual walk-throughs are conducted with fire officers.  Pre-planned command posts and staging areas are designated and IC transfer and liaison protocols have been established.  Post incident de-briefings are conducted.\n\nSchwan continuous improvement process, a designated PSM Steering Team consisting of salary and hourly employees, post-incident reviews and annual 8-hour refresher training for the emergency response team are to improve safety and emergency response."
