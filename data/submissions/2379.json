This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our well trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC/Daviess County Sheriff's Department) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of various latex polymers, which falls under Standard Industrial Classification (\"SIC\") Code 2821.  We have six regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile], Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Vinylidene chloride, and a 20%, 2-4 and 80% 2-6, isomeric mixture of Toluene diisocyanate.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  1,3-Butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinylidene chloride are used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymers.  Toluene diisocyanate is used for manufacturing polyurethane prepolymers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] at our facility is 500,997 lb. while Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-], 1,3-Butadiene, Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile], Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanato-2-methyl-] and Toluene 2,4-diisocya"

The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Vinyl Acetate.  In this scenario 467,374 lb. of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 2,015 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] involves the release of 233,687 lb. of toxic liquid from the Vinyl Acetate storage tank and is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 587 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.51 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] involves the release of 82,066 lb. of toxic liquid from the Acrylonitrile storage tank and is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 2,214 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L of Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is 0"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L of Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanato-2-methyl-] is 0.10 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate  [Benzene, 2,4-diisocyanato-1-methyl-] involves a release from Toluene Diisocyanate.  The scenario involves the release of 12,006 lb. of toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L of Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate  [Benzene, 2,4-diisocyanato-1-methyl-] is 0.10 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Butadiene.  In this scenario 247,698 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene is released. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.50 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Butadiene.  The release is assumed to result in a BLEVE.  The scenario involves the release of 125,100 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene.  Passive mitigation controls such as a sprinkler system are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the m"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements and we also have submitted a Clean Air Act, Title V air operating permit application to the EPA for approval.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHampshire Chemical Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Some examples of the process safety information include Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all raw materials and products, Equipment Specification Sheets, and Process Instrumentation and Design drawings (P&ID).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with e"

Five-year Accident History\nHampshire Chemical Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years.  This release took place on 03/21/1996 and involved 0.025 lb. of Toluene diisocyanate.  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there was one injury.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nHampshire Chemical Corporation carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nOwensboro Daviess County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.
