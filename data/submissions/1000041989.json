One of the most important aspects of the prevention program is adherence to the mechanical integrity portion of the PSM Program, using specific standards established for the ammonia refrigeration industry by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  Additionally, a strong emphasis is being placed on employee involvement and training to assist management with continued development of the prevention program.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nRosina Food Products, Inc.'s (RFP) produces various food products at our Empire Drive facility located in West Seneca, New York.  RFP has a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\nA.  Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nRFP takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  RFP has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained associates to respond quickly to system upsets.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\nB.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations at this facility.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Risk Management Plan\n\nThe facility has a PSM/RMP Program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  The PSM/RMP Program consists of the following elements:\n\nManagement Systems\n\nEmployee Participation Program\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining Program\n\nContractor Safety Program\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\nMechanical Integrity Program\n\nHot Work Permit Procedures\n\nManagement of Change Procedu"

Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies. \n\n\n\nF.
