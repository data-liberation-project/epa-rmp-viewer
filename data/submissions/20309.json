      "SummaryText": "Accidental release and emergency response polidies at the Elan facility are summarized in an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is prepared in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The stationary source is a 15,000 gallon above ground storage tank that contains the regulated chemical ethyl chloride.  Ethyl chloride is listed as a regulated substance due to it's nature as a flammable gas.  The worst case release scenario simulates the release of 75,000 pounds of ethyl chloride that results in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing the EPA software RMP-Comp, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure as a result of the worst case release scenario is 0.3 miles from the stationary source.  The alternative release scenario simulates a release from a 250 gallon reactor tank assumed to contain a maximum of 3,900 pounds of ethyl chloride.  Utilizing RMP-Comp, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a release from the reactor is 0.1 miles.  Public receptors within the distance of the overpressure end point include industrial, a correctional facility, and the Passaic River.  The general accidental release prevention program for the Elan facility includes employee training, pressure relief valves, and interlocks.  There has not been a reportable release of ethyl chloride in the past 5 years.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Newark HAZMAT Team, local fire department, and emergency health care professionals.  Planned changes to improve safety include continued employee training."
