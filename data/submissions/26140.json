      "SummaryText": "Evans Fruit Company operates a medium-large controlled atmosphere fruit storage warehouse a few miles south of Mattawa, WA, just off State Highway 243.  During an autumn loading season of a few weeks, and for sproradic unloading (typically during the spring of the next year), there are a few forklift operators working in the plant.  A refrigeration operator checks the facility about three times a week; additional monitoring is done via modem connection to the plant's computer contol system.  Much of the time, the warehouse is unattended.\n\nNear the facility is one residence for the manager of some surrounding orchards not related to the plant.  No other people-containing buildings are within a mile.  The highway is about 0.2 miles away; the Columbia River about 0.9 miles.  There are no environmental receptors within range of credible potential leaks from the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nEvans Fruit maintains ongoing relationships with experienced refrigeration contractors in Yakima and with the Mattawa Fire Department.  In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about fifteen minutes away; response from Yakima (owner, refrigeration contractors) is about ninety minutes.  Because of few or no persons being near the site, and because of the distance of responders from the plant, the emergency response strategy is essentially passive.  Masks are available, and the fire department has keys to the facility plus familiarity with the \"king valve\" location.  Thus small leaks can be attended to.  In the event of a large release, the release would most likely be over before a proper Haz-Mat team could be assembled on site.  In such cases, it is not expected that persons would attempt to enter the facility."
