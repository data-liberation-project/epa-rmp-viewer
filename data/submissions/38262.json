The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This RiskManagement Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nNevada County Sanitation District No. 1 provides wastewater collection and treatment for several unincorporated communities in Nevada County.  Its wastewater treatment facility, Lake Wildwood Wastewater Treatment Plant, is located at 12622 Pleasant Valley Road, Penn Valley, CA in Nevada County, and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located in a semi-rural area near the dam forming Lake Wildwood.  There are 4 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and trunnion sets inside"

      "SummaryText": "the building.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control.  Pressurized gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or sulfonators located in a separate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1's operations.  The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, removing unused header support structures to improve access to the ton containers, and creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNevada County Sanitation District No. 1's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Nevada County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at its wastewater treatment and reclamation plant sites. Public agency First Responders have participated with Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and consi"
