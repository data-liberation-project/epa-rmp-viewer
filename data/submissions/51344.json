The reason for submitting this RMP is to update the hazardous scenarios from Rural to Urban.    This facility has two ammonia refrigeration systems with inventories above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nPilgrim\u00bfs Pride Canton Processing Plant recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the facility.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Cherokee County Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all governm"

The alternative release scenarios were identical for both systems and the results of the affected areas were also the same.  We do have several active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.  We also incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00b7  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n.  Preventative maintenance program\n.  Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n\u00b7  Performance of process hazard analyses of the entire system including equipment and piping\n\u00b7  Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\u00b7  Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n\u00b7  Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n\u00b7  Up-to-date process safety information\n\u00b7  Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n\u00b7  Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n\u00b7  Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.  They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  Anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the regulations.

Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for timely completion as required.\n\nThe Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation\u00bfs Canton facility has an emergency response program.
