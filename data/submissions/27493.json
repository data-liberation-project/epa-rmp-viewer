BAPS operates with strigent policies and protocols designed to protect the health and safety of employees and neighbors, as well as the environment. This message is communicated through ongoing training programs designed to raise awareness and build necessary on-the-job skills. Performance in these areas are regularly evaluated through audits, assessments, and other means, with the goal of measuring progress and identifying areas for continued improvement.\n\nBAPS's participation in the RMP program is triggered by the use of only one substance (chlorine) on site in quantities that exceed the threshold amount. BASP uses only one chemical above the threshold quantity, Chlorine (CAS #7782-50-50). Chlorine is used in the treatment of swimming pools to purify the water to accepatble comfort levels. BAPS repackages chlorine from one-ton cylinders into 18# cylinders for swimming pool usage.\n\nA hazard assessment was conducted on the chlorine operation using the RMP*COMP model. A detailed report on all findings and operations of the BAPS facility is avaliable for review.\n\nBAPS performed a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) to address the potential hazard of the chlorine repackaging process and to evaluate the controls for a accidential release of chlorine. Employees were involved in determining hazards of the process and subseqquent conseqquences. The process was determined to be operating safely and no changes were recommended.\n\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at the Facility. Employees have been assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP have been implemented. BAPS has developed specific programs to assist employees in performing, recording, and documenting the various elements of the RMP.\n\nAt the time of the submittal of "

      "SummaryText": "the RMP, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the Facility over the past 5 years. However, in the event of an accidental release, an Emergency Action Plan is in place that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. Employees will not respond to an accidental release but will coordinate with outside responders. The plan also addresses all notification procedures.\n\nBAPS is pleased to share the information in this document. While no industrial site is entirely free from risk, it is the BAPS goal, through continous improvement, to manage risks as effectively as possible. This plan demonstrates the BAPS committment to a safe operation and protection of the public and the environment."
