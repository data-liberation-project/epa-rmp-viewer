      "SummaryText": "The City of Mercedes Sewage Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The Mercedes emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in complicance with EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n\nThe sewage operations include one facility of concern: the chlorination building located at the Sewage Treatment Plant, where the chemical of concern is chlorine.\n\nThe City of Mercedes Sewage Treatment Plant is located at Mile 8 1/2 North and Mile 1/2 East, Mercedes, Hidalgo County, Texas. The chlorination building at the Sewage Treatment Plant consists of a two-walled canopy structure facing south that is located approximately in the middle of the facilty. Two, one-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored at the facility. Only  one, one-ton container is connected to the system. The one-ton container is located inside the walled canopy structure. The chlorine container has a manual shutoff valve in case of an emergency and is manned eight hours a day, and operators inspect the chlorination building daily. Three Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 300 yards away from the chlorination building.\n\nThe general Mercedes Sewage Treatment Plant accidental relase prevention program is based on the following key elements: the high level of training of the operators; the preventive maintenance program; the use of state of the art process and safety equipment; the use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators; the performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures; and the implementaion of na audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps "

      "SummaryText": "include the availability of Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operator during connection/disconnection of each chemical supply, the awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chemical detector.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Mercedes' Fire and Police Departments. Both of these entities are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Commitree (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a noticication plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually."
