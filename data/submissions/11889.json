The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk and ice cream within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Mayfield Dairy Farms is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that t"

The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint. The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel is released. The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to 100% capacity, considering administrative controls (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the vessel). The vessel, however, is normally filled to 30-60% capacity. There were no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel is located outdoors\n\nI\n\n In addition, Dean Foods has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors that can remotely close certain isolation valves in the event of a small release and thereby limit an accidental release of ammonia. These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer that will shut certain valves to the system if ammonia is detected. In this way, potential releases of ammonia are minimized.\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which a relief valve fails with no passive or active mitigation considered.  \n\nThe toxic"

Based on EPA's guidance, the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less. This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects. Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\nAlternative Case Release Scenario: The alternative case release scenario selected is one in which a relief valve fails. EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario. The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1) \tMust be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and\n2) \tMust reach an endpoint off site, unless no such criteria exist.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program, Mayfield Dairy Farms has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.

In addition, the McMinn Emergency Services has included Mayfield Dairy Farms in its local emergency response planning.\nFive-Year Accident History: Mayfield Dairy Farms has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. A more thorough training program for our employees utilizing our S.O.P.'s and P.H.A's in order that more employees are properly prepared for an incident is the procedure we are changing in order to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be implemented by December 1999.\n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.\n\n DEANS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"
