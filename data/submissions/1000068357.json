A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Evonik on community issues.  Evonik also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.  \n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  1) Small Molecule Manufacturing, manufactures Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for commercial and clinical trials of human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities and warehouses.  2) Large Molecule Manufacturing, manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives. This area includes manufacturing facilities, Utilities, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  3) Site Services, includes Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery and storage tanks, Incineration and infrastructure areas that provide services to the entire site.  The site also has laboratories and pilot plant facilities supporting research and development.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Tippecanoe Labs in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations:\n\n"

The site's response is coordinated by the plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment.   The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\n \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS\n\nTippecanoe Labs maintains a fully trained emergency response organization that is on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The site has approximately 109 fully trained emergency response personnel.  Site emergency response teams undergo regular training by the full time Emergency Services Group.  The instructors are certified through the State of Indiana and authorized to teach any state hazmat and fire curriculum.  Each response team member receives 120 hours of initial training in Hazmat Awareness and Operations & Fire 1. Once initial training is successful completed, each member has a least 40 hours per year of continuing education handling industrial fires and hazardous materials.  The emergency response organization has responsibility for custom-designed response equipment.  Vehicles on site include a fully equipped chemical response truck, an ambulance, an incident command vehicle, a fire engine equipped with 1250 gal of AFFF Foam, a fire engine equipped 1000 gal of water, and a foam truck designed for mutual aid response.
