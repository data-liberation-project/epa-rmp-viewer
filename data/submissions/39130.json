              "Description": "The wastewater treatment process at this facility itilizes two regulated toxic substances - chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The two chlorine units and one sulfur dioxide unit are separate and they perform different functions.  However, these units are similar in operational characteristics.  The primary chlorine unit is adjacent to the sulfur dioxide unit, with the two units sharing a chemical feed building and storage area.  The Safety Section of the prevention programaddresses both chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety.  Material Safety Data sheets for both substances are included.\n\nThe Hazard Review for this RMProgram was performed on June 16, 2004 by Alan PLummer Associates, Inc. and covered both chlorien and sulfur dioxide.  Safeguards for both were found to be similar.  The recommendations that resulted from the Hazard Review  generally apply to both substances.  The Hazard Review demonstrated that the City's risk management program for regulated substances is excellent.  Many of the recommendations that resulted from the Hazard Review are procedural in nature.  The City is responding to the recommendations in an appropriate and timely manner.\n\nThe Operations, Maintenance, and Training elements of the Prevention Program have been addressed through a development of a singel Procedures Manual.  This manual provides single source information for most of the day-to-day aspects of operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems for the facility.\n\nThe compliance audit was conducted in 2002 and is included as an element of the Prevention Program.\n\nThe incident investigation element of the Prevention Program was addressed by including a form to be completed should an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide occur.  Also included are instructions for developing a team to investigate an incident, should one occur.",

The facility is owned and operated by the City of Waxahachie.  This facility is a conventional wastewater treatment plant and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 10,000 pounds of chlorine and 8,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68 are stored or utilized at the facility.  \n\nSafety Policies\nThe City of Waxahachie is fully committed to safety at the wastewater treatment plant.  The Waxahachie Utilities Department has long emphasized the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements as an opportunity to further refine its safety program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the wastewater treatment plant and the City Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, should a release occur.  Finally, the City is committed to continuing to improve its risk management program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe City?s commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide is best exemplified by its excellent track record with these substances.  The wastewater treatment plant has not experienced an accident related to chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years.  The City is not aware of any such accidents prior to the past five years.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nFor the facility?s offsite consequence analysis, sulfur dioxide was established as having the largest radius of impact, and was thus used for the worst-case scenario.  Public receptors do exist within this radius, including residences, educational facilities, parks, "

Realistic potential alternatives were modeled, with consideration toward actual conditions at the site.  The resulting radii of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description\nThe City?s prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air will be minimized.  This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program will also become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel. \n\nThe Program 2 Prevention Program includes seven primary components:\n\n-Safety Information: Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment. Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n-Hazard Review: Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard review are being resolved in a timely manner.  \n\n-Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures will also be updated should a major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\n\n-Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.

The results of the audit will be documented, and deficiencies corrected.\n\n \n-Incident Investigation: Should an incident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe City of Waxahachie has determined that the Wastewater Treatment Plant will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The Fire Department for the City will instead be the appropriate local emergency response agency in such cases.  The Waxahachie Fire Department has the necessary training to respond to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks.

Should a release occur or be suspected when employees are at the facility, employees responsible for working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop the release before it becomes a significant problem.
