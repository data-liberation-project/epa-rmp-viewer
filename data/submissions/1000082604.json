      "SummaryText": "Suburban Propane's Elk Grove (SPEG) Terminal consists of storage of more than 20 million pounds of liquefied propane, high pressure blimps, railcars and tank trucks, and associated transfer piping and valves. The bulk storage tanks (T1 and T2) are both refrigerated, low-pressure steel, aboveground storage tanks. The SPEG Terminal stores and transfers propane, a flammable material, in excess of the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 pounds, making it subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (Cal-OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, the California Accident Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP). All of these programs require implementation of 14 elements of the PSM Program, an offsite consequence analysis for assessing the impact of a release of propane to the community, and a 5-year accident history. The regulations require the offsite consequence analysis be completed for both worst-case and alternate (credible) worst-case scenario. The SPEG Terminal is covered under the CalARP Level 3, as it is subject to Cal-OSHA's PSM standard, has offsite consequences that extend beyond the plant boundary, and could impact sensitive offsite receptors.\r\nThe SPEG Terminal is also regulated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS), which requires comprehensive security standards for site access and product control.\r\nConsistent with the regulatory requirements, the SPEG Terminal has developed emergency response protocols and coordinated with offsite responders, including the Elk Grove Fire Department; Elk Grove Police Department; Sacramento County Sheriff's Department; and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, Consumnes River Division. Moreover, the SPEG Terminal maintains onsite fire-fighting and emergency response systems and equipment to support and augment offsite emergency"

The volume released in 10 minutes would result in a vapor cloud explosion.
