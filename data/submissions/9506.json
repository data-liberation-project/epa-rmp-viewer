      "SummaryText": "The McWhorter Technologies (McWhorter) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania facility is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it operates, by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the facility's procedures and compliance manuals, which are available to all employees.\nMcWhorter's Philadelphia facility stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs and in written materials available at the facility. The safety and environmental programs include safety committee meetings and monthly process quality meetings of all employees. McWhorter has a safety and process quality hotline which mandates written corrective action. Pre-start up safety reviews are periodically conducted for new products and new process equipment; the corporate operating procedures are kept in the document controller's office.\n\nMcWhorter has an Environmental Health and Safety Manual of policies and procedures that covers general environmental, health, and safety best practices and compliance topics, such as proper hazardous waste handling. There are regularly scheduled safety and environmental surveys conducted by facility management, and periodic safety and environmental surveys of the facility conducted by McWhorter corporate personnel.\n\nMcWhorter manufactures resins for paints and coatings. To carry out these processes, the material toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is stored and used at the facility. TDI is used as a raw material in the manufacturing process. TDI is the only material used at the Philadelphia facility which is regulated under the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations as stated in 40 CFR Part 68 (\"RMP regulations\"). The chemical is brought on site by tanker trucks, stored, and transferred to other vessels on an as-needed basis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario associated with the release of a toxic substance at the f"

      "SummaryText": "acility is the release of the total contents of the TDI bulk tank. The tank has a capacity of 5,548 gallons. However, since McWhorter's operating procedures specify a 5,000-gallon maximum working level, a 50,000-pound release is considered worst-case. Since TDI is a liquid at room temperature, a release as a gas is considered unrealistic. Under these conditions, the RMP regulations dictate the worst-case scenario as an instantaneous release to form a liquid pool in the bermed containment area surrounding the TDI tank. Please note that the U.S. EPA's RMP*Submit software does not allow the correct data entry for the release rate of 0.007 lbs/min and the release duration of 8,326,319 minutes in Section 2 (Toxics: Worst Case) of this document. The minimum data entry of 0.2 lbs/min and the maximum data entry of 9999.9 minutes were entered as a result of this software deficiency.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario associated with the release of a toxic substance at the facility is a faulty hose connection from the tank wagon to the bulk tank, resulting in a spill of TDI in the bermed area. The estimated spill quantity is 100 gallons (50 gallons per minute for 2 minutes.) Since the tank wagon unloading operations are continuously monitored and personnel in proper protective gear are present, any TDI release would be quickly contained, blanketed, and cleaned up.\n\nSafeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) files located on site. All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters within allowable limits. Additionally, the TDI process is equipped with alarms to alert personnel if TDI is detected in the air at the process area. The device measures in parts per billion (ppb) and would alarm at 5 ppb. Computerized documentation (printout ticket) of each alarm is maintained in McWhorter's TDI PSM files. The facility developed procedures "

      "SummaryText": "and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits to ensure the correct response to the alarms.\n\nPersonnel at the facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from January 1994 to the present to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. No accidental releases were identified.\n\nOverall safety at McWhorter is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases. McWhorter, therefore, developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has a trained emergency response team, appropriate equipment and supplies, and a detailed emergency preparedness plan. Personnel at the facility are trained as first responders for any TDI-related incidents. Facility personnel are trained to fight incipient fires, but would relinquish authority to the Philadelphia Fire Department to respond to propane-related incidents.\n\nThis document has been prepared to satisfy the Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulations."
