      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nMetal Finishing Technologies (MFT), operates a metal finishing job shop in Forestville, Connecticut. The MFT facility, which occupies approximately 3.6 acres, is situated north of the Pequabuck River and south of Camp Street. Chlorine is stored on-site at the facility and used for water treatment in the cyanide reactors. Because the quantity of chlorine stored on-site in a single process exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) provisions under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments (40 CFR Part 68), also known as the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\" Because MFT is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, MFT is subject to \"Program 3\" in the tiered RMP approach.\n\nThe primary chlorine storage facility consists of four one-ton chlorine cylinders located near the northwest corner of the building. The chlorine gas system consists of four one-ton chlorine storage tanks (two of which are used at one time), a vacuum regulator, a \"V-Notch\" control valve, an Eductor, a 2.0 HP centrifugal pump for cyanide reactor I (CNI), a 3.0 HP centrifugal pump for cyanide reactor II (CNII), a \"Y\" strainer, and associated appurtenances (flexible tubing valves, controls, PVC piping, etc.).  The chlorine system is surrounded on the north, south and east by concrete block walls and to the west by an overhead door.  Chlorine is transferred to the chlorinator via A?\" flexible teflon tubing and then to the cyanide reactor via PVC tubing.  The chlorine gas system described above comprises the \"covered process\" under this RMP.\n\nThe one-ton chlorine containers are delivered to the MFT facility by truck. The chlorine containers are unloaded outside the chlorine building using a hydraulic boom. The boom lifts the containers from the truck and enters the chlorine storage room through an overhead door. The \"covered process\" under this RMP includes "

The facility's chlorine storage, handling, and distribution system is designed and operated in accordance with state and local laws and manufacturers information. Emergency response procedures for the MFT facility, including the chlorine storage area, are described in MFT's Contingency Plan (CP). In general, outside responders and the local fire department are notified of all chlorine releases other than incidental releases that can be controlled at the time of the release (i.e., shutting a valve) by personnel in the immediate release area.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe MFT chlorine storage, handling, and transfer facilities addressed in this RMP comply with EPA's accident prevention rule as well as applicable state and local codes and regulations. The chlorine system is designed, installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with good engineering practice and industry-specific guidance developed by the Chlorine Institute and MFT's current chlorine cylinder supplier, Jones Chemicals.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidents involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place have occurred at MFT in the past five-year period (June 1, 2004 to June 1, 2009).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmergency procedures described in MFT's CP will be followed in the event of an emergency involving the chlorine gas distribution system. If the chlorine leak is manageable and the emergency coordinator determines that the chlorine leak is minor, there MFT may elect to stop the leak themselves using trained employees with the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). However, i"

      "SummaryText": "f a chlorine leak is beyond the capabilities of MFT employees, all employees shall immediately evacuate the building. The Fire Department and other appropriate agencies shall be immediately notified. An outside contractor would likely be contacted who is trained in the handling of such a release. In a catastrophic release of chlorine, MFT shall, to the extent feasible, directly inform nearby local businesses, schools, and other potential receptors to warn them of the impending danger of the chlorine gas release. This effort will focus on receptors within the worst-case scenario distance to endpoint (0.9 miles surrounding the building). A copy of MFT's CP has been provided to the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNone."
