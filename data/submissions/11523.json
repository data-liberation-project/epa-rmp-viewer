This facility is a meat processing plant privately owned.\nSite Description:\n    The facility is located in North East, Pennsylvania at 56 Smedley Street, North East, Pennsylvania 16428.  \nGeography and Weather:\nNorth East is a township as a part of Erie County which covers 800 square miles.  The township itsel covers 4.2 square miles. And the North East Borough, 1.5 square miles.  Located on Lake Erie, the lake has a powerful and dramatic effect on the weather.  The average yearly snowfall for the area is 85.1 inches.  The average seasonal temperatures for the area are 69.4 F in the summer and 27 F in the winter.  The most rain falls during September:  an average of 4.39 inches.\nTransportation:\nAirports:  A privately-owned, grass-stripped airfield is available.\n    Population and Labor Force\nThe population of the township is 6,283.  The population for Erie County is 275,572.\nGovernment and Law Enforcement\n    The township is governed by a Board Supervisors.  There are eight police officers of which two are part-time in the borough.  Fire protection is provided by a voluntary force.\n    Schools\n    There is one high school, one junior high school, one elementary school and several private schools in North East.\n    Medical Care\nLocal physicians provide care.  Five hospitals are located in Erie.\nOperation Description\n    The site process involves the receipt of meat products for slicing and packaging.  No animal processing takes place at the facility.  Industrial lift trucks move the materials.\n    From the time of receipt and throughout the storage period, the materials are maintained at a cool temperature by anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes.\n    The air cooling process involves the distribution of liquid ammonia through piping (coils) across which air is blown with fans to cool the air.  \nTechnology of the Process\n    Refrigeration is the control of heat.

The amount of energy or heat available is determined by the amount of motion or excitement of the atoms or molecules.  The more excited the molecules, the more energy or heat available.\n    This energy or heat can be moved or transferred.  This transfer occurs when there is a difference of temperature.  Heat flows from a source of grater energy (higher temperature) to a source of lower energy (lower temperature).  The greater the temperature difference, the more rapid the heat flow.\n    There are three types of heat transfer mechanisms:\nConduction\nConvection\nRadiation\n    The use of liquid ammonia as a refrigerant is the transferring of heat by conduction and convection.  In conduction heat is transferred by the molecules in a medium coming in contact with each other.  The warm molecules collide with colder molecules giving them some of the energy (heat).  The flow will occur if there is a difference of temperature from one side of the medium to the other.  Metals are very good at transferring heat by conduction.\n    By blowing air or moving a liquid such as water or glycol over a material such as metal that has been cooled heat is transferred by convection.  The heat load in a freezer is moved via convection to the coils where conduction takes place in transferring the heat to the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process does not produce cold.  It simply moves the heat from an area where it is not wanted to a place it can be discharged.\n    The refrigeration systems at Better Baked Foods are accomplished by two methods using Anhydrous Ammonia.  These include:\nAir Cooling\nWater Chilling\n\n    Liquid ammonia has the ability to absorb very large amounts of heat as it vaporizes.  This ability is the basis for mechanical refrigeration systems.  These mechanical systems ut"

These include, 1) Receiver, 2) Metering device/expansion valves, 3) Evaporator, 4) Compressor, and 5) Condenser.\n    The Receiver collects the condensed vapors and stores the excess refrigerant charge that is not circulating through the system.  The receiver is located between the condenser and the expansion valve.  It is also used to store refrigerant when it is necessary to service the system.\n    The liquid ammonia is routed to a metering device (expansion valves).  This device regulates the amount of refrigerant going into the evaporator.\n    As the ammonia flows through the device, there is a pressure drop.  The amount of pressure drop determines the temperature of the refrigerant going to the evaporator.  The refrigerant leaves the metering device in both a liquid and a vapor phase.\n    The two phase refrigerant then enters the evaporator.  The evaporator removes heat from the area or substance being cooled.  The ammonia absorbs heat and vaporizes as it travels through the evaporator.  The ammonia then leaves the evaporator and travels to the compressor.\n    The compressor takes the vapor through the suction line and increases the pressure such that when the heat is removed in the condenser, the vapors change form and become liquid.  Work is required to compress these vapors.  This work is converted into energy and stored in the compressed vapors.  This increase in energy results in an increase in temperature.\n    The compressed vapors then go to a condenser.  The condenser removes a lot of the heat contained in the compressed vapors.  When enough heat is removed, the vapor changes form and become liquid.  This condenser liquid then flows to the receiver.\n    Better Baked Foods, Inc. receives Anhydrous Ammonia by wheeled vehicle.  The receiver has a maximum of 9,500 pounds, which is filled to 80% capacity.  The Anhydrous Ammonia is in a liquid for"

Owners or operators may use Census data to define this population.  The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted.  The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed.  The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas, that can be exposed to an accidental release.\n    The worst case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the complete rapid loss of 2703.2 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia during a one-minute time frame. The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F, 10 mph wind speed, and a level of 200 ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.  This resulted in a release rate of 2,703.2 lbs/min, and an end point of 3.53 miles from the spill point at 67 degrees F.  \n    The alternate case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the loss of Anhydrous Ammonia resulting from a release through a 2-inch line break. .
