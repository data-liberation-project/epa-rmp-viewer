KAAPA Ethanol, L.L.C corporate policies place the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.  The owners, management and employees of the KAAPA Ethanol facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous materials.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Kearney County Emergency Management (Local Emergency Planning Committee), and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment. The 5 year PHA that is required in March of 2020 has been pushed out until June, 2020 due to the CO-VID 19 virus and with all required updates anticipated due for completion by July 31,2020. \n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the processing of grain into fuel-grade ethyl alcohol.  The ethyl alcohol manufacturing process involves the use of anhydrous ammonia and natural gasoline.  The natural gasoline is referred to as product denaturant and is used to make the ethyl alcohol unfit for human consumption.   \n\n\n\n3.    Five-Year Accident History.  No accidents have occurred within the most recent five-year period. \n\n\n\n4.    Emergency Response.  The emergency response program established by KAAPA Ethanol allows for personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances in the event the release can be controlled using KAAPA Ethanol personnel and equipment in the area.  KAAPA Ethanol has identified additional resources to assist in mitigation, control and disposal of a release.  The local emergency response agencies will be relied upon to inform the public about the release. KAAPA Ethanol has developed an Emergency Action Plan outlining actions taken in the event of an accidental release of regulated substances as well as in the event of natural disasters.  The Emergency Action Plan"

The details in the ERAP are provided after the Emergency Action Plan within this Executive Summary. \n\n\n\n6.    Accidental Release Prevention Program.   KAAPA Ethanol, L.L.C. plant has implemented several environmental, emergency, and safety programs at the facility.  These plans are crucial in our everyday operation and procedures.  Daily, weekly, and monthly checks are completed that affect our ability to respond to emergencies, including a Health and Safety Plan.   Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) plans have been prepared and implemented, with updates completed as needed to ensure compliance and effectiveness.   All implementation is accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and time frames.  KAAPA Ethanol has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for a Program Level 3 facility.  The facility conducts weekly and monthly training as part of our normal activities.  Training consists of regulated safety requirements.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented in accordance to regulation.  Natural gasoline (denaturant) is a PSM-applicable chemical mixture on site.  The PSM program covers distillation tanks and piping, and storage tanks utilized for anhydrous ethanol and denatured ethyl alcohol.   Safety inspections are completed regularly, utilizing in-house and outside expertise to conduct.  Periodic reviews are completed on plans and procedures in place, with scheduling for additional training as part of the review process.  As previously mentioned in section 5 of this executive summary, KAAPA Ethanol implements an ERAP as part of the Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure requirement to prevent and respond to chemical spills on site.

This may include such things as high winds, heavy rain, hail and/or lightning.  The winter version, Severe Winter Storm Warning, could also produce heavy snow, and hazardous sub-zero wind chills.\n\nSevere Weather Warning    Indicates that a dangerous storm is imminent.  Note:  A severe weather warning is not necessarily a prerequisite step for a tornado warning.  When conditions are favorable for severe weather, they may also be favorable for a tornado.  It is possible for a severe weather warning and tornado conditions to be present at the same time.\n\nTornado Watch    Issued by the National Weather Service, indicates the weather conditions are adequate for the development of a tornado. A watch condition could exist for up to 12 hours.\n\nTornado Warning    Means a tornado or funnel cloud has been sighted in the area, or is indicated on radar.  Tornado warning status means there is immediate danger of tornado(s), and that tornado emergency procedures should be initiated.\n\n    \n\nVI)    Emergency Gathering and Shelter Locations\n\nA)    Fire or Hazardous Material Release - In the event of an evacuation the primary meeting location will be in the North East edge of the administration building parking lot.  \n\nB)    Tornado - In the event of a tornado warning all plant personnel are to take shelter in the grain pits, restrooms, or shelter in maintenance building.  Administrative personnel are to take shelter in the basement restrooms of the administrative office building.  Contractor's and all drivers onsite during a tornado warning will be required to take shelter in the grain receiving pit or restroom areas.   \n\nVII)    Emergency Equipment Location List \n\nA)    Fire extinguishers are locat"
