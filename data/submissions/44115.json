The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\n   The program level for each facility is determined by:\n   Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n   Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n   North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n   Five-year accident history\n   OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\n   As of October 25, 2005, Delta Terminal Services remains regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\nThe facility currently stores Toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate, Chloroform, Cyclohexylamine and Epichlorohydrin in excess of the threshold quantities.\n   \n   Therefore, a release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptors such as a residence and school.  The facility does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule and it is not subject to OSHA PSM because PSM does not apply to flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks which are kept below their normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration [29 CFR 1926.64(a)(1)(ii)(B)].).  In addition, none of the toxic chemicals meet the Progran 3 criteria as they are not a listed OSHA PSM chemical.\n\n   The regulation, 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G, applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated subs"

In addiition, on June 17, 2004, a 5 Year re-submittal was completed which updated the RMP by including inventory for Drum storage, potential railcars and tanktrucks onsite, a 5 year accident history, updated emergency contact informatiom and removal of the OCA from the executive summary.  Delta was last required to submit an updated RMP, Revision 1 to cover cyclohexylamine on April 29, 2005.  The purpose of Revision 2, dated July 19, 2005, is to correct data submitted in revision 1, apply new modeling for TDI using EPA's RMPComp software and cover Epichlorohydrin. The puprose of this update, dated October 25, 2005, is to updae the EPI storage quantity onsite and update the off-site consequence analysis and newly completed HazOps. \n\n   Delta Terminal Services remains committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. Employees involved in operating the TDI, Chloroform, Cyclohexylamine and Epichlorohydrin activities are thoroughly trained to identify and understand the hazards posed by these transfer processes.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.  Materials include information pertaining to the hazards of TDI, Chloroform, Cyclohexylamine and Epichlorohydrin, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures.\n\n   The Stationary Sources for Cyclohexylamine, TDI and Chloroform are storage tanks and related appurtenances.
