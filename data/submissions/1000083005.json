To this end, safety systems such as incident investigation, corrective action tracking, near miss reporting, SCAN, internal audits, and observations conducted by the Safety Improvement Team have been developed and continuously improved.  An excellent base of safety systems exists to ensure safe work procedures and proper PPE.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that human behavior plays an integral role in safety performance, Louisiana Pigment has focused more attention in recent years to the human dimension of safety.  A safety culture has been established that makes safety a value in all aspects of our operation.  Key to this culture is full management commitment to safety along with employee awareness and commitment, both on-the-job and off-the-job.  Employees throughout the organization are trained to champion safety by demonstrating safe behavior and watching out for co-workers.\r\n\r\nRecently, a program has been developed and is being rolled out in 2019 to emphasize the need to maintain good housekeeping.  The program emphasizes good housekeeping is a key to have a safe and an environmentally responsible worksite.

Louisiana Pigment has implemented several programs to encourage all employees and resident contractors to have a primary role in assessing their work environment and to recommend changes.\r\n\r\n1.\tSurvey, Consider, Analyze, and Notify (SCAN) is a program that provides all employees a method to identify and correct unsafe conditions, recommend improvements to job task, and other recommendations to improve the workplace.\r\n2.\tSafe Track is a behavioral observation program in which employees volunteer and are trained as observers.  The observers then participate in reviewing actual job task completed in the field.  This provides an opportunity to observe and make changes that could improve the safety of conducting the task in the field.  This program has evolved through the years to the Safety Improvement Team.  The Safety Improvement Team is comprised of chemical technicians from different areas of the plant that rotate every three months.

      "SummaryText": "process.  Titanium dioxide is used in industry for generating brilliantly hued paints, in the manufacturing of primers and base coats, in automotive finishes, and in coatings for the exterior of buildings.  Beyond this, titanium dioxide can be found in materials such as high-quality papers, color plastics, furniture panels, textile fibers, glass, ink, porcelain, toothpaste, cosmetics, candy, food coloring, PVC, white sidewall tires, and a growing list of other items.  Plastics are transparent and acquire their gleaming whites and opacities through the addition of titanium dioxide.  Titanium dioxide also improves the physical properties of many plastics.  It absorbs ultraviolet light, making the material more resistant to weathering.\r\n\r\nManufacturing Process\r\n\r\nThe chloride process at Louisiana Pigment uses high-grade titanium ores (natural rutile, titanium ores, or synthetic rutile) to recover titanium dioxide (TiO2).  This is done by first producing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as an intermediate product, then oxidizing it to form TiO2 particles to the purity required for further processing and finishing treatment.\r\n\r\nThe two steps that most characterize the Chloride Process are the continuous chlorination of ore in the fluidized bed chlorinator and the continuous oxidation of titanium tetrachloride in the gas phase to titanium dioxide using a burner.  These two steps are completely dependent upon each other since the chlorine released by oxidation is recycled to the chlorinator.  Through the use of analytical measurement and computer control technology, it is possible to optimize essential production variables, reduce down time to a minimum k and operate machinery at maximum safety standards.  On the premise that operating conditions are kept at an optimum for every step of the chloride process, 90-95% of the titanium dioxide contained in the original ore can be recovered and used in the end product.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specifi"
