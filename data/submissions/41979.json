      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA is a political subdivision charged by legislative mandate with three functions.  These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serving as a local sponsor for federal water projects, and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA\u00bfs defined territory that includes all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles. \n\nTRA\u00bfs greatest impact to the general public is ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  TRA provides essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is TRA\u00bfs duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  \n\nTRA\u00bfs Central Regional Wastewater System (CRWS) was placed in operation in 1959.  This regional treatment facility is one of the largest and best operating plants in the State of Texas.  With the treatment plant located in Grand Prairie and over two hundred miles of pipeline, this system has been named one of the best wastewater treatment plants in the State of Texas by the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission and by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The CRWS discharge permitted capacity was uprated from 135 MGD to 162 MGD in April 2001, after additional improvements to the solids handling capacity were completed.  The system has a service area of 450 square miles and provides services to twenty-one Metroplex area cities.  This system uses state of the art technology in collection system telemetering, computer systems, operational control and maintenance management.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the CRWS is"

      "SummaryText": "required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the quantity of chlorine and ammonia that it uses in its treatment process.  In developing its RMP, CRWS has conducted an analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental release including a \u00bfworst-case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative case\u00bf release scenario.  In addition, the facility has compiled a five-year accidental release history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The CRWS has an outstanding safety record and there have been no accidents related to chlorine and ammonia processes in the past five years.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nCRWS places the highest emphasis on safety and hazard prevention.  To this end, we have developed a comprehensive prevention program that includes the following key points:\n\n\u00bf   Annual training is required by all operations and maintenance employees who work in and around hazardous chemical storage and loading areas.\n\n\u00bf   Visual inspections of these covered processes are conducted by operations personnel on each shift.\n\n\u00bf   Sensors and alarms are in place around all process areas to detect any leakage of the hazardous chemicals.\n\n\u00bf   Written operating procedures are continuously updated and maintained for operations personnel to use during their work routines.\n\n\u00bf   All accidents are investigated promptly with written documentation of all findings.  These accident investigations are reviewed by management and Certified Safety Professionals to determine cause and prevention.\n\n\u00bf   Monthly safety audits are conducted of all plant process areas including covered process areas.  Written documentation of these monthly audits, including actions taken to correct problems, is maintained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\u00bf   Preventative maintenance programs for covered processes are in place and a computerized records management system is in place to automatically generate reports regarding preventative maintenance needs and/or histories on all covered pr"

The plans have been reviewed by the local Fire Departments and local Emergency Planning Committees.\n\nThe plant has trained and equipped emergency response teams onsite 24-hours per day, seven days per week.  These emergency responders have drilled with local fire departments and hazardous materials responders.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY AND OUR COMMUNITY\n\nTRA's continued commitment to the safety of our facilities and our communities is illustrated by our continuous improvement process.  Our facilities continue to take advantage of updated technology and advancements in the way we operate.  This includes site security.  Recent facility upgrades have included perimeter monitoring, security cameras, and policies and procedures to ensure access to our facilities is by authorized personnel only."
