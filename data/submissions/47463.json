      "SummaryText": "A. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility is located in Fresno, California, and utilizes refrigeration for cold storage and freezing of peaches, nectarines, plums, and strawberries.\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administer the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Wawona to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release involved could potentially impact the local community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\nThe refrigeration systems are closed loop systems similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nWawona Frozen Foods maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system has a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor gives off heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.  (In operation the system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side.)  Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods are chilled or frozen.  \n\nAmmonia is the regulated substance of c"

The Cling system is not subject to the RMP rule as it contains less than the threshold quantity of ammonia.  However, the RMP elements will be implemented facility wide.  There is a total of 41,250 pounds of ammonia in the two refrigeration systems.   \n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Wawona Frozen Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five year accident history investigation (October 2001 to October 2006) revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.  \n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWawona Frozen Food's Emergency Action Plan was designed to ensure a safe and healthful working environment.  The policy at Wawona Frozen Food is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Emergency Action Plan outlines the company s"

During the first few moments of the event, the witness should assess the situation as follows:\n\n1) How severe is the problem?\n2) Is there any personnel in danger?\n3) What is running at the time?\n4) Where is the leak source?\n5) What can be done about the leak?\n6) Has the hazard communication process been initiated?\n\nIf the operator was able to extinguish the emergency, then the accident investigator should be notified.  The accident investigator then proceeds to consider several questions as to the incidents surrounding the emergency.  The questions are numerous and include finding out key elements as to the occurrence of the accident.  Some key questions include the following:  \n\n1) Who was involved?  \n2) What was the accident? \n3) When did it occur? \n4) Why did the operator react the way he did? \n5) Where did the accident occur? How did he get injured? \n6) How could this be avoided in the future?\n\nAll ammonia leaks, regardless of size, are reported to the Fresno Fire Department.  Finally, the refrigeration service organization is notified to assist in putting the plant back on-line following an ammonia release.\n\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\nIn the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, personnel will be instructed to vacate the premises to the designated assembly area.  This is upwind of the release and typically at the northwest corner of the facility.  \n\nMitigation Measures\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.

Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the ammonia refrigeration system while exiting the area; however, the installation of ammonia sensors is the primary mitigation measure for shutting down the system.\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWawona Frozen Food is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
