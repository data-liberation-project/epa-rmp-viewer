The mixture is the propellant in aerosol paint cans warehoused at the Blackhawk Park Avenue facility. The propellant is stored within individual aerosol cans ranging in size from 3 ounces to 15 ounces net weight.\n\nThe Testor Blackhawk Park Avenue facility is used to assemble and fill paint bottles and paint pens, and the facility is also used as a warehouse for finished material including aerosol paint and propellant cans. The aerosol paint cans are stored in a specified area near the center of the warehouse which is protected by fire-rated block walls.  Based on the size of the storage area, a maximum of 1.2 million cans can be stored at any one time.  This equates to a total propellant storage of 202,500 pounds.  The largest single container is a 15 ounce can which contains 100 percent propellant. The propellant is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, is flammable, and is potentially explosive.  The propellant is not inherently toxic. \n\n\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, a worst case release from the largest single container was analyzed to assess the maximum distance to an endpoint that could result in offsite impacts.  Based on the quantity of propellant stored in a single container, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release is contained to the inside of the building. No public receptors are located within the endpoint distance.\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidenta"

      "SummaryText": "l releases of propellant at the Testor Blackhawk Park Avenue facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage off site.\n\n\n4.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Blackhawk Park Avenue facility is considered a Program 1 process under the RMP regulations and, therefore, implementation of a prevention program is not required.  Also, based on the worst case scenario, an offsite impact cannot occur.  Preventive measures implemented to ensure that there are no off site impacts include storing the materials in a designated, concrete block, sprinklered room near the center of the building.\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Testor Blackhawk Park Avenue facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency \nAction Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, including incidents related to a release of propellant.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for plant employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel in the facility.  The EAP identifies specific individuals and their responsibilities, and identifies procedures for emergency medical care."
