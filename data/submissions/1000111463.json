(\"Plains\") is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. Plains' management goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Tampa Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by Plains. At the facility, we receive propane via vessels/ships/railcars. The received propane is stored in a large refrigerated atmospheric tank. Propylene is used as the refrigerant. From this tank, propane can be loaded directly into tanker trucks for distribution, or loaded onto rail, barge or ship. Ethyl mercaptan is used as odorant on tanker trucks. Propane, ethyl mercaptan and Propylene are the only flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Tampa Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. There are no toxic substances present at the site. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00bf\tOperatin"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown devices at locations throughout the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\n\u00bf\tMinimizing the possibility of overfilling by having high and high high level alarms on all propane storage tanks.\n\u00bf\tProviding a facility-wide fire water system at the facility, which is designed to cool the tanks in the event of a fire.\n\u00bf\tA hydrocarbon gas detection system consisting of numerous gas detectors located throughout the facility. The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm at low gas concentrations and will trigger emergency shutdown system at high gas concentrations (in parts of the facility).\n\u00bf\tA fire detection system consisting of several UV/IR fire-eyes, which will trigger emergency shutdown system when activated.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nWithin the last five years, there have been no chemical release accidents that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage or offsite impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activit"

The Tampa Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions. A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\u00bf\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bf\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00bf\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\u00bf\tInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u00bf\tAn ongoing dialogue with the local emergency response agencies will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact any of the local emergency response agencies for th"
