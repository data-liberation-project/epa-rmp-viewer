As part of this commitment, the mill has established a system to ensure safe operation of the processes at the facility.   One component of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that aids in the management of hazardous chemical safety in the mill; in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR, part 68.  One of the requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan), describing the risk management program at the mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the rule as it applies to the mill.\n\nThe risk management plan (RMPlan) was originally submitted on June 21, 1999 for the Androscoggin Mill and this information was shared with the public at a meeting with the town of Jay on January 13, 2000.  \n\nThe risk management program at the mill consists of three elements:\n1.\ta hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the regulated substances  (Chlorine dioxide and ammonia) regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered process).\n\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from the covered process.\n\nVerso Paper limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Mill, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  Considerations are taken with also the existing chemicals on site.  For example, chlorine and methanol have been replaced with alternative, non-RMP covered chemicals.\n\nWhen a hazardous sub"

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the process; including studying all safety aspects of the process through the Hazard and Operability studies (HazOps) and in the case of chlorine dioxide, following OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard  (1910.119).\nVERSO PAPER, ANDROSCOGGIN MILL\nThe mill is committed to the safety of the workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers as well as minimize impact to the public or the environment.  IP provides training to all personnel, has a designated emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinated response efforts with the local fire department.  These response activities are documented and discussed with the LEPC.\n\nN 1992, the mill began a formal prevention program for the chlorine dioxide generation and storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of IP\u00bfs prevention program that address the EPA prevention program requirements.\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program:  The program 3 prevention plan applies to the chlorine dioxide generation and storage processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.Process Safety Information\n2.Process Hazards Analysis\n3.Operation Procedures\n4.Training (Operation & Maintenance)\n5.Mechanical Integrity\n6.Management of Change\n7.Pre-Startup Safety Review\n8.Compliance Audit\n9.Incident Investigation\n10.Employee Participation\n11.Hot Works Permits\n\nThe Androscoggin Mill acquired the cogeneration plant where ammonia is used in"

Ammonia is covered as a program level 2 chemical.\nProgram 2 Prevention Plan:  The program 2 prevention plan is in place for ammonia used in the cogeneration facility, which consists of the following elements:  \n\n1.Hazards Analysis\n2.Operating Procedures\n3.Training\n4.Management of Change\n5.PreStartup Safety Review\n6.Compliance Audits\n7.Incident Investigation\n8.Employee Participation\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no release incidents that have affected the surrounding community in the past five years.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nVerso Paper has developed a written emergency response program to aid in the response of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n1.\tInforming the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in off-site consequences.\n2.\tProviding proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at the mill\n3.\tControlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\n4.\tInspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n5.\tReviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\nThe mill maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures. All mill employees are trained in evacuation procedures. The mill periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local fire department, police department, and the state and local emergency planning commissions.\n\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations and has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  The mill maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief, and Verso provides appropriate information to the fire chief."
