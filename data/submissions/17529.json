Using the EPA's look-up tables, the conservative distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane or LP-Gas stored onsite is 24,000 gallons in the storage tank and associated piping, valves, burners and other miscellaneous equipment.  The worst-case scenario involving propane or LP-Gas is a vapor cloud explosion.  Based on the USEPA look-up tables, the distance to an endpoint is estimated to be 0.4 miles.
