To comply with the requirements in\n40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF FORT\nWORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk Management Program\n(RMProgram) for the EMWTP including Management System, Hazard\nAssessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and Emergency\nResponse Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the risk of injury, \ndeath or damage from accidental release of chemicals, to employees and the \npublic. \n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Manager\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nD.

Storage, transfer, and use of anhydrous ammonia in ammoniation\n     system\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in two (2) side-by-side\nidentical 5,000 gallon tanks located indoors.  At full capacity, the \nmaximum liquid chlorine inventory is 60,000 lbs per tank, or 120,000 lbs\ntotal. At 85% capacity, the maximum liquid chlorine inventory in each \ntank is 52,000 lbs, or 104,000 lbs total. Negligible quantities in the \npiping are excluded.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in two (2)\nside-by-side identical 3,000 gallons tanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid \nammonia inventory in each tank is 85% of tank water volume of 3,000 gallons. \nBy assuming an ammonia density of 42.5 lb/ft3, the ammonia volume for one tank\nis converted to a mass of 14,500 lbs. with the exclusion of negligible \nquantities in the piping, the maximum process quantity is 29,000 lbs. of \nanhydrous ammonia.\n\n3    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program Manual was\ndeveloped.  The main purpose of the manual is to provide operation and\nmaintenance personnel detailed standard procedures to reduce employee\nand public risk to injury, death or property damage from accidental\nchemical releases.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe EMWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.
