General accidental release and prevention policy of King & Prince Seafood Corporation.\n\n\n\nKing & Prince Seafood Corporation is a frozen seafood processing facility that utilizes anhydrous ammonia\n\nas a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection\n\nAgency. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to\n\nobserve certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the\n\nsurrounding community and the environment.  \n\nIt is our policy at King & Prince to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\n\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and\n\nstate regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental\n\nrelease of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our\n\nplant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety\n\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nKing & Prince Seafood Corporation, 1 King & Prince Boulevard, Brunswick, Georgia operates a\n\nrefrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical\n\nrefrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat\n\nexchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration\n\ncycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and\n\ncondensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.\n\nCompression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The\n\nrefrigeration cycle is "

      "SummaryText": "a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature,\n\npressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system uses this\n\nphenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through\n\ncondensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\n\n\n\nThe King & Prince Seafood Corporation facility has approximately 500 employees, including hourly and\n\nsalary personnel, that manufacture and prepare shipment of frozen seafood products via truck\n\n24-hours per day, five to seven days a week.\n\nThe potential hazards\n\nthat could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment\n\nfailure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\n Although ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\n\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\n\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\n\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\n\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \n\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\n\nbut only in a very narrow concentration range when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n     The following administrative and engineering controls are in place at King and\n\nPrince. These controls are designed to eliminate, or reduce the possibilities of an accidental\n\nrelease from the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n     *  Electronic ammonia detection installed in the storage freezers. Alarm system activates\n\na local audible alarm to alert plant personnel of the potential ammonia leak in the monitored area. \n\n     *  High liquid level switches are configured to recirculators. High level switches will shut\n\ndown associated compressor operation during a high level condition.\n\n     * All "

Five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nThe King and Prince Seafood facility  has had zero accidental releases in the last five years. \n\n\n\n5.   Emergency Action Program\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the King and Prince Seafood Emergency Action Plan is to:\n\n\n\n     1.   Minimize exposure to our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a\n\n     hazardous material release or spill.\n\n\n\n     2.  Assure the safe emergency evacuation of the plant in the instance that it is required.\n\n\n\n     3.  Provide for prompt medical attention to any employees who become seriously injured\n\n     or ill at work.\n\n\n\n     4.  Facility management has developed an Emergency Response Plan to ensure a fast and   \n\n           efficient response in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials. \n\n\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan currently meets requirements as set forth in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38,\n\nEmployee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plans."
