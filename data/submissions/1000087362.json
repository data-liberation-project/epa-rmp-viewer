This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:  The Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are readily"

New employees receive basic training in Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:  The Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

(Midcoast), is committed to the same level of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, Midcoast follows a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nThe Facility, located in rural Wheeler County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (i.e., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. The inlet gas stream enters the plant through pipeline(s) and flows through liquid separation equipment which separates raw condensate and produced water from the gas. The separated gas stream from the liquids separation equipment flows through the molecular sieve gas dehydration desiccant beds, which removes the water from the gas before it flows into the cryogenic natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery unit. The NGL recovery unit lowers the gas temperature to begin processed recovery of NGL consisting of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes. The separated NGL is stored in one (1) 45,000 gallon pressurized tank and exits the site via pipeline(s). The residue gas stream from the cryogenic NGL recovery unit is co"

There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantities present at the Facility. The Facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about Midcoast's operations at the Facility, the programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, the emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, Midcoast's five (5) year accident history, and planned changes to improve safety at the Facility.\r\n \r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulations, the worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquid in the largest vessel at the Facility causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of this Facility, this would involve the 45,000-gallon flammable NGL tank (164,995 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPA's RMP*CompTM calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of one (1) pound per square inch (psi) would be approximately 0.4 mile (approximately 2,112 feet).  An overpressure of one (1) psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario for flammable substance release, was also considered for this Facility. The Alternate Release Scenario would result in a vapor cloud explosion from the loss of NGL from the 45,000-gallon NGL bullet tank due to a four-inch puncture of the tank and a release of 98,200 pounds of NGL in 10 minutes. Using the EPA's RMP*CompTM calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud exp"

This incident could occur if vehicle traffic impacts the tank or piping breaks off of the tank. As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted at conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the vehicle drivers.  Barriers are in place to prevent trucks from hitting tanks. Additionally, the Facility has a driving plan that communicates safe driving practices to all plant visitors. This alternative scenario also covers any process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds.\r\n\r\nMidcoast has discussed potential flammable gas releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Wheeler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of impacts to the public.   \r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the Accident Prevention Program in place at the Facility.  Because the processes at the Facility are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program are important steps toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.

      "SummaryText": "Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.).  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). Process safety information is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operatin"

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  The Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one (1) additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  The Facility has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner. Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices:  The Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC):  The Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenan"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Facility periodically conducts audits to determine whether procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's finding are tracked until they are complete.

Although Midcoast takes pride in that record, we place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure this record continues.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the NGL extraction, handling, and storage operations, the EAP will be followed. Activation of this EAP sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly. The 911 call is channeled through the Wheeler Fire Department. All agencies and personnel respond to pre-determined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the central Command Post (CP). A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with emergency personnel from responding agencies, as needed. \r\n\r\nThis coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
