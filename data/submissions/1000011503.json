AUGUSTINE\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.\tExecutive Summary  68.155\nThe City of St. Augustine Utilities Department operates the City of St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant #1 at 254 West King Street, St. Augustine, St. Johns County, Florida.  This plant is one of three water plants operated by the City.  The West King water plant is the only facility that has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Water Treatment Plant #1 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe City of St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n\tThe City of St. Augustine has a management system in place which is lead by the Public Works Director, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n\tThe City of St. Augustine maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Water Treatment Plant.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the City of St. Augustine\u00c2\u00bfs water plant Document Managemen"

It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n\n1.3.\tWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00c2\u00bfthe &#61628; shall assume that the &#61628; maximum quantity in the largest vessel &#61628; is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00c2\u00bf  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00c2\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\u00c2\u00bf.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00c2\u00bftoxic endpoint.\u00c2\u00bf  The EPA  specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The  3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00c2\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00c2\u00bf  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \u00c2\u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected.\u00c2\u00bf\n1.3.1.\tWORST CASE   (c)(1)\n\tAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions outlined in RMP-Comp.

This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs  water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 30.0 lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.3 miles.

The program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.

It is a covered gated open-air storage area.\n1.4.2.3.\tEquipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  This system is only inches long leading from the chlorine container to the pressure regulator bolted to the containers.  \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.
