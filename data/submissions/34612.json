Because New Braunfels Utility (NBU) \r\nfacilities contain quantities of regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantities, it is \r\nsubject to the RMP regulations.\r\n \r\nFacilities\r\n\r\nNBU is responsible for both potable water and wastewater treatment in a certified service \r\narea in the general vicinity of the city limits of New Braunfels, Texas. NBU operates one \r\nsurface water treatment plant and six wells for potable water treatment and three municipal \r\nwastewater treatment plants.\r\n \r\nCurrently, the NBU Kuehler North Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) stores both \r\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide in up to three, one-ton containers. The NBU Kuehler South \r\nWWTP stores both chlorine and sulfur dioxide in up to four, one-ton containers. The \r\nquantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored onsite exceeds the EPA\u00bfs threshold of 2,500 \r\npounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively, thus subjecting Kuehler WWTPs to the RMP Rule. \r\nThe RMP primarily consists of the following three elements: Offsite Hazard Assessment, \r\nAccident Prevention Program, and an Emergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nApplicable Program Level\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations define three Program levels based on the relative potential for public \r\nimpacts of a process, the level of effort needed to prevent accidents, and coverage by other \r\nregulations. The Program levels are defined as follows:\r\n\r\nProgram 1:  Process with no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a \r\nworst-case scenario and with no accidents with offsite consequences within the past five \r\nyears.\r\nProgram 2:  Process not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3.\r\nProgram 3:  Process not eligible for Program 1 and subject to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard under \r\nfederal or state OSHA programs.\r\n\r\nTh"

The RMP \r\ndeveloped for the Kuehler WWTPs follows requirements of a Program 2 process.\r\n\r\nOffsite Hazard Assessment\r\n\r\nAn offsite hazard assessment was conducted for the Kuehler WWTPs to determine the \r\ndistance a toxic concentration of chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas would travel in the \r\nevent of a release. The toxic endpoint concentration for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is three \r\nparts per million (ppm). The population within the radius of the release and sensitive \r\nreceptors such as hospitals, schools, and state parks were identified. Two release scenarios\u00bf\r\nthe \u00bfWorst Case\u00bf and an \u00bfAlternative Case\u00bf were considered. The Hazard Assessment also \r\nincludes a five-year accident history of the Kuehler WWTPs.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario assumes the entire contents of the largest single container are \r\nreleased, regardless of how improbable that may be, over a period of ten minutes. \r\nTherefore, the Kuehler WWTPs must model offsite impacts of a 2,000-pound chlorine and \r\nsulfur dioxide release over a duration of 10 minutes. The resulting release rate is 200 pounds \r\nper minute. The worst case scenario also requires conservative meteorological conditions. A \r\nrelatively slow wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and a stability class F must be assumed. \r\nStability classes are categorized by the amount of turbulence in the atmosphere. Class F is \r\nthe lowest turbulence classification. With low wind speed and atmospheric turbulence, the \r\nchlorine plume will dilute slowly, causing an increased distance to the toxic endpoint. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, only \u00bfpassive\u00bf mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes can be \r\nconsidered.

Using the predicted \r\ndistance, potential offsite public and environmental receptors were determined.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur \r\ncompared to the worst case scenario. Unlike the worst case scenario, the alternative release \r\nscenario may consider \u00bfactive\u00bf mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers. \r\nActive mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input. \r\nFurthermore, the alternative release scenario assumes more realistic regional and seasonal \r\nmeteorology as compared to the worst case scenario. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario modeled for the Kuehler WWTPs involves a one-ton \r\nchlorine container rupture due to dropping it during changing out empty containers with \r\nfull containers.

An effective \r\nmaintenance program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release and addresses \r\nequipment testing and inspection, preventive maintenance schedules, and personnel \r\ntraining. When implemented, a regular maintenance program ensures that process \r\nequipment performs properly and that documentation exists to support reliable, safe \r\noperation and maintenance of the process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nAn incident investigation program has been developed that outlines the investigation team, \r\ninvestigation process, and implementation of changes. Ultimately, it is desired that the staff \r\nlearn from incidents and act to prevent similar incidents in the future. Necessary forms for \r\ndocumentation are included and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each \r\nincident.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nProcedures were developed to complete a compliance audit for the Kuehler WWTP. A \r\ncompliance audit is a self-evaluation of the effectiveness of the RMP program that identifies \r\ndeficiencies, assures corrective action, and increases safety awareness among plant staff. To \r\nensure compliance with the program, the RMP includes a checklist that the Kuehler WWTP \r\nstaff must complete at least once every three years. The program manager of RMP for NBU \r\nmust certify that the RMP team has evaluated compliance with provisions of the program, \r\nand verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit \r\nreport forms are provided, the two most recent of which must always be maintained (older"

Currently, the \r\nKuehler WWTP is a non-responding facility and relies on the New Braunfels Fire \r\nDepartment to respond to all substantial releases. The Kuehler WWTP is also included in \r\nthe Comal County City Emergency Management Plan developed under the Emergency \r\nPlanning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). \r\nIf in the future, if NBU decides to take further action to stop a release, an emergency \r\nresponse program consisting of an emergency response plan, emergency response \r\nequipment procedures, employee training, and procedures to ensure the program is up-to-\r\ndate must be developed.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nA management system was developed to oversee implementation of the RMP elements. The \r\nmanagement system assigned the NBU Executive Director of Water Utilities as the position \r\nwith the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the \r\nRMP elements. Additionally, it defined the lines of authority so that NBU staff understand \r\ntheir individual responsibilities to implement the RMP elements on an ongoing basis and \r\nhow to communicate the procedures outlined in the program.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nWhile developing the RMP for the Kuehler WWTP, several deficiencies were noted.  These \r\nwere compiled, along with other mitigative recommendations, and evaluation and \r\nimplementation responsibility was assigned to each item. The full list can be found in \r\nSection 2 of the RMP, \u00bfHazard Review\u00bf."
