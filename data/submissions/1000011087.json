Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center is primarily a grocery distribution warehouse, owned by ACG Fort Worth LLC (formerly owned and operated by Winn Dixies Stores, Inc.  ACG Fort Worth LLCrequired the facility to maintain its previously developed accident prevention programs and emergency response plan for the site.  The Fort Worth Business Center personnel on site are responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the Fort Worth Business Center, including training for on site personnel.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center is located at 5500 South Freeway, Fort Worth, Texas.  The facility consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to grocery stores.  \n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center has an ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the machine room or compressor room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the compressor room.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding approximately 14,646 pounds of ammonia.  This vessel will be used to determine the Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) for the facility.  \n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OHSA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP purposes, this places the Fort Worth Business Center process in the Program 3 level.  The Fort Worth Business Center will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program. \n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 C"

      "SummaryText": "FR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventive maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidients due to faulty equipment.  Also part of the PSM Program, operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration process have been developed.  These procedures are used to train operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The staff refrigeration personnel receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  Exisiting safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping and Instrument Diagrams (P&Ids), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies discovered.  Other PSM Procedures, including Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation, are also part of yhr program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support from PCCP-IRG management.  \n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center has had no accidiental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Fort Worth Business Center has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  Since internal emergency response capabilities are not available, the City of Fort Worth 1st responders will respond to any accidental ammonia release.  Evacuation procedures are include in the plan, and the LEPC (Fort Worth Office of Emergency Management) has been informed of the procedures.  Notification is "
