Gehl\u00c2\u00bfs Germantown facility is a food processing plant which produces dairy products, for the retail and service markets.  Ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGehl Foods uses many precautionary measures to prevent or minimize the accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include built in safety systems that will generate alarms or automatically shut down the refrigeration system if design limitations are exceeded (eg. Pressures, temperatures, or vessel operating levels).  These safety systems in conjunction with PLC automated control ensure that the system operates within safe limits minimizing the likelihood of an ammonia release.  A comprehensive Preventative Maintenance program is used to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of all equipment in the refrigeration system.  Mechanics and operators are trained to maintenance and operating procedures to minimize the chance of human error and to maintain a well informed and qualified group of refrigeration personnel.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThere is one ammonia refrigeration system at the Germantown facility.  Ammonia is the only substance handled at the Germantown facility covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.  The system contains approximately 25,000 lbs of ammonia.\n\n\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Germantown facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. The prevention"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related accidents at the Germantown facility in the last five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nE.   Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the Germantown facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  This program has been coordinated with the Germantown fire department through emergency planning, onsite tours, and discussions.\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll ammonia releases, regardless of size, are investigated following incident investigation procedures.  The objective is to identify recommendations that will prevent these releases from re-occurring. Safety improvements are made to equipment and procedures using this technique to continually improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system at the Germantown facility.  These procedures in conjunction with Hazard Analysis findings, Audit findings, and continuous scrutiny of the system following Mechanical Integrity procedures result in continuous upgrades to minimize the likelihood of ammonia releases."
