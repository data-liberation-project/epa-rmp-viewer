      "SummaryText": "The Blaine County #3 (BC3) compressor station is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation,operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BC3 COMPRESSOR STATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe BC3 compressor station, located approximately 30 miles south of Havre in Blaine County, Montana, operates a\n\nrefrigeration system to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas. The facility products include propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES AT THIS STATION\n\nThe facility operates a storage tank containing a mixture of Propane, Butane, Pentane and trace heavier hydrocarbons.  Safety and Environmental compliance is maintained with Emergency Response Plan, operating and maintenance procedures, and coordination with LEPC personnel.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe BC3 compressor station has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility continually\n\nlooks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility.  We continually strive to improve communication with state and local agencies."
