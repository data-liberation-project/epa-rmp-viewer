In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\n\n\nGerald Grain Center's Mission states \"to provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public\". In order to fulfill this mission, Gerald Grain Center provides an outside safety consultant to assist in creating and maintaining a comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures. The consultant and Gerald Grain Center employees audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\n\n\nThis location is required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered. \n\n\n\nThis location has a \"site safety coordinator\" and branch manager. This coordinator and manager monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, and conduct employee training.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of agricultural products and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck,"

      "SummaryText": " is handled and stored on-site, and is a sbustance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultral crops.\n\n\n\nThis facilty maintains nurse tanks for customer delivery and storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 3 stationary storage tanks [1 @ 30,000 gallons 2 @ 18,000 gallons] on site. The maximim storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks is 308,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity is 553,000 pounds. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of despersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. It should be noted that Gerald Grain Center has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from this distribution facility.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank reprsenting a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 26,638 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. It should be noted Gerald Grain Center has not had a release of this type from this distribution facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL REL"

This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks and other application equipment, are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least every 3 years, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competancy with the regulation is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off site.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for "
