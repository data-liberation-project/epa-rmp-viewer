      "SummaryText": "SOURCE \n\n\n\nThe Rust-Oleum Corporation (Rust-Oleum) Martinsburg Distribution Center (DC), located at 891 Auto Parts Place, Martinsburg, West Virginia, is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release (40 CFR 68) because it stores a mixture of n-Propane (CAS 74-98-6) and n-Butane (CAS 106-97-8), each in excess of 10,000 pounds, within aerosol paint cans as propellant. A total of approximately 2,421,817 pounds of propellant may be stored, at any one time, in the DC.  Finished goods are transferred to the DC for interim storage prior to shipment to retail stores.  \n\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nFor the Worst-Case Scenario, the aerosol can contents are considered non-toxic, but flammable and a highly explosive gas.  The mixture within each aerosol can is propellant (the n-Propane and n-Butane), flammable liquid solvents and paint solids, with each can containing approximately 16-oz of this flammable mixture.  As the propellant is the more flammable/explosive component in the aerosol can, the entire 16-oz is assumed all propellant in a 65/35 weight % split n-Propane to n-Butane.  The individual aerosol cans are stored in cardboard cases, 6 per case.  274 cases are stored on a single pallet.  The pallets are then stacked no more than 2 high in multiple rows within the DC. A single pallet of aerosol cans was considered a single vessel, with the instantaneous release of the mixture in all the aerosol cans on a single pallet as a Worst-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Offsite Consequence distance to an over pressure of 1 psi was determined using equation C-2 provided in Appendix C of the OCAG guidance document; dated April 15, 1999. No administrative controls or passive mitigation systems were considered in this scenario.  The heat of combustion values were obtained from Exhibit C-1 of Appendix C of the OCAG guidance document. The following values were used in the calculations: 45,719 kJ/kg for n-Butane a"

      "SummaryText": "nd 46,333 kJ/kg for n-Propane.\n\n\n\nBecause the site qualifies for the RMP Program 1 requirements, no alternative release scenario was required to be assessed.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE IMPACT\n\n\n\nThe endpoint distance from the worst-case release scenario, 0.095 miles (501 feet), does not extend beyond the property line of the Martinsburg DC facility.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors are impacted.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of the covered flammable substances at the Martinsburg DC facility in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on-site; or off-site death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by the RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational controls are in place to decrease the severity or prevent the occurrence of a fire or explosion. The most significant controls are described below:\n\n \n\n     1.  The warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol \n\n         Products code (NFPA 30B).\n\n     2.  Aerosol storage is limited to a maximum height of 15 feet, i.e., 2 pallets.\n\n     3.  The pallets of aerosol cans are stored separate from other flammable liquids and separated by a 2 hour minimum rated fire wall.\n\n     4.  A fire sprinkler system designed for 0.53 gpm/ft2 has been installed in the DC.\n\n \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN \n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan is maintained at the Martinsburg DC facility and reviewed annually to update and/or make recommended improvements to site safety.  Included in the Plan are communication and coordination instructions with the Berkeley County Office of Emergency Management emergency response team.  The DC also files annual Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) Tier II chemical "
