The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care. \nFPL Food does not respond to emergencies. FPL Food coordinates its Emergency Action Plan with the Augusta LEPC. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest the leak will notify a supervisor, maintenance or risk management. Under certain circumstances an alarm will sound and automatically notify the 24-hour security company who in turn will page the Facility Manager. In either event a team of at least two trained individuals will respond to the scene to assess the situation. Portable radios and an ammonia sampling meter are used for communication and air sampling. The emergency coordinators will be notified of the situation and will determine what procedures and personnel, including contractors, are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFPL Food regularly performs Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), Mechanical Integrity Inspections\n(MIIs) and Compliance Audits per their Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.

The contractors will also be periodically evaluated to ensure they perform their work duties safely. All contractors that work on the refrigeration system will also be required to have an ongoing safety program that includes compliance to 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.134.\n\n7.

Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n1. Employee Participation:\nThis program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.\nThe program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\n\n2. Process Safety Information:\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system.

Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\nFPL Food recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\nFPL Food has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of FPL Food Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with FPL Food Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designated to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68).\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency action plan is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents. As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and any physical damage.\n\nB. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates a plant at 1301 New Savannah Road, Augusta, Georgia. The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration processes, in which to cool their product for storage and distribution. Due to th"
