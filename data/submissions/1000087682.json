Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\r\nCountry Pure Foods, Inc.'s manufacturing sites comply with applicable federal, state and local regulations.  This food processing facility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\r\nThis Country Pure Foods, Inc.'s facility is located at 58 West Road, Ellington, Connecticut.  This facility manufactures cold fill fruit juices and fruit juice cocktails from concentrates shipped from around the world.

      "SummaryText": "l Country Pure Foods, Inc. manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room, high- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious system overpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is ensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.  Annual physical system audits are performed by an external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity.\r\n\r\n4.   Five Year Accident History\r\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.   Emergency Response Program\r\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Specific employees are designated and further trained to respond to a release in accordance with OSHA 1910.120(q).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation. The local LEPC is the Ellington LEPC.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned Improvements \r\nThe facility is in the process of preparing for the replacement of a pasteurizing process that will improve system performance in provide some newer, more efficient equipment."
