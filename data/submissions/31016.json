      "SummaryText": "United Ag Service, Inc. Gorham, Kansas is an agricultural retail business that specializes in grain storage for area producers as well as providing the necessary inputs for grain production.   This company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place.  Our farmer owners, managers and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe worst case scenario and alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local responders as part of an on going training program. \n\nThis company maintains and operates their Nh3 plant in strict accordance with all federal, state and local authorities.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Those changes or improvements will be acted upon immediately to reduce potential ammonia releases.  Our employees are trained in safety procedures, proper plant operation, plant maintenance and the employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of safety water during nurse tank loading operations. \n\nWith the above mentioned training in mind, it makes it very simple to report to you that absolutely no injury accidents or property damage have occurred at this facility for the past five years.\n\nOur emergency response plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and the area first responders.  This company provides plant tours for our local fire department and our plan has been shared with the county local emergency planning commission (LEPC).  They are aware of the dangerous nature of Nh3 and they have agreed to assist us in the event of an emergency."
