The aqueous ammonia is  stored  at ambient  temperature,  which  for  purposes  of  this  worst-case analysis  was  assumed  to  be  at  the  highest  daily   average temperature  as  historically measured at  the  nearest  National Weather Service station.\n\nThe   EPA's  Risk  Management  Program  Guidance  for  Wastewater Treatment Plants (EPA 1998) was utilized to determine distance to the  toxic  endpoint  for the worst-case release.  This  guidance document  contains methodologies to estimate the  toxic  endpoint distances for worst-case releases of aqueous ammonia from a diked storage  tank.  The  equations  contained  in  the  EPA  guidance document   incorporate   the   prescribed   worst-case   modeling assumptions  i.e., stable atmosphere with limited  dispersion  (F stability  and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).and provide for  corrections for  storage concentration and storage temperature. For  purposes of  the  worst-case  release,  the maximum  concentration  of  30\npercent  and  maximum historical daily daily average  temperature were assumed.\n\nThe  resulting endpoint distance for the worst-case  scenario  is the  less  than 0.1 miles or approximately 508 feet.

INTRODUCTION\n\nMid-Georgia Cogeneration Limited Partnership owns and operates  a cogeneration  facility (Mid-Georgia Cogen or  MGC)  in  Kathleen, Georgia  which  is  subject  to U.S.  EPA  regulations  governing Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements: Risk Management Programs  under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR  Part 68).   This  Risk  Management Plan (RMP) has  been  developed  in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part  68, Subpart  G.  This  RMP  certifies that  Mid-Georgia Cogeneration Limited  Partnership has instituted a Risk Management Program  at the  MGC  facility  that  is  in compliance  with  U.S.  EPA  ARP requirements.\n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable  corporate policies and risk management systems,  thisRMP  document identifies the worst case release scenario and  the facility's five year accidental release history.\n\n           2.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\n2.1. Risk Management Policies\n\nIt  is the policy of MGC management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective of this  program is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and, if  a release were to occur, to minimize the potential impact  to MGC employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThis  objective will be accomplished by utilizing good  operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees,  and coordinating  response activities, a"

Further,  the  MGC management recognizes that it has  a  duty  to protect  its  employees and neighbors from  the  effects  of  all dangerous chemicals.\n\n2.2. Risk Management System\n\nThe  MGC  facility has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the ARP Program and related chemical safety and emergency response programs.  At the MGC facility, the Plant  Manager  has primary responsibility for  implementing  and ensuring  compliance  with  the  ARP  Program.  Other  individual employees  will assist the Plant Manager with various aspects  of the program as required.\n\n       3.   PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR 68\n\n3.1. Facility Overview\n\nThe  MGC facility is a combined-cycle cogeneration facility which produces  electric  power  for sale primarily  to  Georgia  Power Corporation  and process steam to a neighboring industrial  host. The  facility consists of two gas turbines rated at 116 megawatts (MW) each of electric output. Waste heat from the turbine exhaust gases  is  passed  through  a heat recovery  steam  generator  to generate steam. Natural gas is the facility's primary fuel,  with No. 2 distillate oil used as a backup fuel.\n\nThe  combustion  turbine design includes Best  Available  Control Technology  (BACT) for the control of nitrogen  oxide  emissions. The  BACT control technologies for the control of nitrogen oxides include  Dry  Low  NOx  (DLN) combustors and Selective  Catalytic Reduction  (SCR).  SCR  is  a process which  involves  the  post-combustion  removal of nitrogen oxides from the  combustion  flue gas  with  a  catalytic  reactor. In  the  SCR  process,  aqueous ammonia,  which is injected into the turbine exhaust gas  stream,\nreacts  with  the nitrogen oxides and oxygen in the  exhaust  gas stream to form nitrogen and water.\n\nIt  is  this"

Aqueous Ammonia Process Description\n\nAmmonia  is  present at the facility in the form  of  an  aqueous solution in concentrations ranging up to 30 percent. The  aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored in  an above  ground  tank  with a maximum capacity  of  16,085  gallons (36,240 pounds at the maximum concentration of 30%). The tank  is surrounded  by a dike of sufficient volume to completely  contain any  spill from the storage tank. A piping system (both above and below  ground)  is used to deliver the ammonia to the  combustion turbines. Prior to injection into the combustion turbine  exhaust gas  stream, the aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected  as  a gas.\n\n3.3. Program Level Identification\n\nThe  EPA  Risk Management Regulation identifies three  levels  of requirements  defined  as programs. EPA  recognizes  that  some regulated  processes  would not pose an off-site  hazard  in  the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program  1. Program 1 is applicable to any process for  which  it can  be  demonstrated  that the public  would  not  be  adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.\n\n-  no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted    in off-site injury or environmental damage; and\n-  dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations  at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe  facility  has  determined that the aqueous  ammonia  process meets the criteria for Program 1.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan requirements for Program 1 processes are as follows:\n\n- Registration\n- Accident history\n- Hazard assessment for the worst-case release\n- Coordinate em"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe  Hazard  Assessment  under the ARP Program  consists  of  two parts;  1)  a review of the five-year accident history  involving regulated  substances in the covered process and  2)  a  modeling evaluation  of the impact associated with an accidental  release. Because  there have been no accidental releases during  the  most recent  five-year period that had an off-site impact and modeling of  a  worst-case  release  shows  that  off-site  concentrations aqueous  ammonia at the nearest public receptor would not  exceed the  endpoint  concentration, the  MGC  facility  is  subject  to Program 1 ARP Program requirements.\n\n4.1. Five-year Accident History\n\nDuring  the  past  5  years there has been no accident  involving aqueous  ammonia or reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.   This  means that  no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site  injury, off-site evacuation or sheltering in place, or off-site  damage  to  property  or the environment.   Thus,  the  MGC facility meets the Program 1 accident history criteria.\n\n4.2. Worst-Case\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a  sudden  release  of the maximum amount of a  stored  regulated substance from the largest single vessel. Toxic liquids, such  as aqueous ammonia, are assumed to spill instantaneously and  spread to  a  depth of 1 cm in an undiked area or to cover a diked area. The  duration of the release is based on the evaporation rate  of the  toxic liquid, the amount spilled, and the size of the liquid pool.  Only  passive  mitigation (e.g.,  dikes,  enclosures)  and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established toxic endpoints for various chemicals based on  the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response  Planning  Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2),  which  protects individuals"

The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n     the  maximum airborne concentration below which it  is\n     believed  that nearly all individuals could be  exposed\n     for  up  to  1  hr without experiencing  or  developing\n     irreversible  or  other  serious  health   effects   or\n     symptoms which could impair an individual's ability  to\n     take protective action.\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with  a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time  period there  are  a  number of emergency measures that  can  reduce  or eliminate  exposures  to levels this high for  an  interval  much shorter than an hour.\n\nUnder  Section  68.22  (e),  the  RMP  rule  identifies  surface roughness  as  a  parameter  to  be  specified  in  the hazard assessment.   The  surface  roughness  affects  the  amount  of  dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance  to  toxic  endpoint.  The  surface  roughness  used  in determining   the   distance   to  toxic   endpoint   should   be characteristic  of  the  transport path of  the  plume  from  the release point to the endpoint distance. `Urban' surface roughness indicates  areas  where  there  are  many  obstacles,   such   as industrial buildings or trees.  `Rural' indicates that there  are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\n\nIn  the  immediate vicinity of the aqueous ammonia storage  tank, the  aerodynamic surface roughness is `urban' in nature,  due  to the buildings, tanks and structures at the site. Urban dispersion was therefore used in this analysis.\n\nAt the MGC facility, the regulatory prescribed worst-case release is  an  instantaneous spill of the entire contents of the aqueous ammonia  storage  tank.
