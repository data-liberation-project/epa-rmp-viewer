The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of the Bloomington Water Treatment Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of chlorine by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the chemical. Should an accident occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is potable water production and, in conjunction with this operation, chlorine is received, handled and stored for use in disinfection of the water. Disinfection of the drinking water is of the utmost importance in the process.\r\n\r\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program: Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under both 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. We strive to achieve the most effective program possible through regular maintenance, review, and improvements to our process safety information documents, regular (5 years or less) process hazard analysis studies, operating procedures, mechanical integrity inspections, and audits, in addition to the other activities listed in PSM guidance documents. We constantly confer with employees about safety concerns and accident prevention concerns and recommendations. We require all vendors to provide training in the safe handling and use of  chlorine and all other bulk chemicals used at the plant.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of chlorine for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering"

Emergency Response Plan: Our facility carries a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. This comprehensive plan includes first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Our plan is regularly reviewed with the local fire department and is provided to the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: We constantly review and seek opportunities to increase the safety and reliability of all our processes and equipment at the plant, including chlorine. One of our current goals is to institute regular full scale drills with all of the agencies involved with emergency response."
