Delta Pride has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for Delta Pride utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium. Anhydrous ammonia is the only highly hazardous chemical above the threshold quantity on-site.  The System contains nine high stage compressors and eight low stage compressors.  The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling on twelve of the compressors and water cooled oil coolers on the remaining five compressors.\n\nThe System contains nine evaporative condensers to convert the high pressure ammonia gas into high pressure liquid. After the high pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory of 19,700 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia, includes three high stage recirculators which provide high temperature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes three low stage recirculators which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.\n\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the low temperature recirculators to the suction of the low stage compressors.  The discharge from the low stage compressors goes to the high stage recirculators, which provide ammonia vapor to the suction of the high stage compressors.  The discharge from the high stage compressors p"

The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the Delta Pride Refrigeration System in good operation.\n\nThere have been seven ammonia releases at Delta Pride during the last five years. These releases have been reported to the state Emergency Management Agency, but did not result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Therefore, these releases are not reportable as defined in 40 CFR 68.42(a).
