      "SummaryText": "NuChem Ltd (NCL) is a retail fertilizer facility.  The materials considered hazardous at the facility are propane, anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia (a 20% solution of ammonia in water).  The facility has one 15,000 gallon propane storage tank, five atmospheric pressure aqua ammonia tanks, totaling 156,000 gallons and storage tanks for other fertilizers that are not considered hazardous under provisions of the Risk Management Plan.  NCL is equipped to receive anhydrous ammonia by rail or truck and to load out aqua ammonia from storage to trucks for use by the farmers as farm fertilizers.  It is NCL policy to meet, or exceed, as local, state and national standards relating to handling or propane, anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.    In the past five years there have been no accidents or releases with off-site consequences.  Specific features employed to minimize the impact of accidental releases include:  1).  Excess flow valves from the propane tank to stop the flow in the event of a piping failure.  2).  Pressure relief valve on the propane tank and the ammonia converters to prevent catastropic rupture due to overpressure.  3).  Diking around the storage tanks to contain any liquid spills.  To further ensure safe operation, NCL employees are trained in safe procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  NCL maintains an active liason with the LaCrosse Volunteer Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  As required by the EPA, NCL has analyzed the worst possible scenarios for both propane storage and for anhydrous ammonia in railcars that may be at the facility.  For propane, the worst scenario would be the release of the contents of the entire tank.  For ammonia, the worst possible scenario would be the release of the contants of an entire railcar.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the effect of the worst case scenario for propane would extend 0.32 miles and would include part of the Centr"

For ammonia, the effect would extend for 7.0 miles and would include the Port of Whitman County Central Ferry Industrial Park, residences and the Central Ferry State Park.  It is extremely unlikely that the EPA's worst case scenaio will ever occur.  A more probable, also highly unlikely, event would be a hose breakage due to the operators failure to uncouple before pulling away.  The effect of such an event for propane would extend only 200 feet and would not include any residences, parks or industrial areas.  For anhydrous ammonia, the effect would extend 2000 feet and would include the State park, the industrial area and residences.  For aqua ammonia, a liquid spill of the largest tank would be contained in the secondary containment."
