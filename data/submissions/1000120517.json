This protection starts with accident prevention through proper maintenance, and the tools of a process safety management program and a risk management program. While the process safety management programs and risk management plans of this facility overlap in many area\u0092s they are independent programs and are treated as such when necessary. \n\nStationary Source:\t\nThe Ziegenfelder facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide process cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is over 10,000 pounds.  The maximum intended inventory in the system is approximately 16,217 pounds.  This is the maximum amount of ammonia at this location in any 12-month period.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention:\t\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\u0095\tEmployee Participation: Employee engagement is critical to accident minimization. This program involves the employees observing when a potential release would occur or is occurring and how to properly respond.  Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted and also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information: Basically, the owner\u0092s manual for the refrigeration system. This allows employees, contractors and first responders to make smart decisions on how to operate the system or minimize a release. \n\n\u0095\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\n\n\u0095\tOperating Procedures: Detailed written procedures have been developed which described the steps, which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration sy"

These also include procedures to properly maintain the system. \n\n\u0095\tTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures the employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties, which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia.\n\n\u0095\tContractors:  Any contractor working on or near the ammonia system is screened to ensure they understand the hazard they are working around. This consists of reviewing the contractor company as well as the individuals who show up to do the work. \n\n\u0095\tPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is performed before starting any piece of equipment that was either installed or replaced using the management of change procedure or when a significant portion of the system was shut down. This systematic checklist ensures everything is in place prior to startup. \n\n\u0095\tMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n\u0095\tHot Work Permit: The written hot work policy requires several points of review when any hot work is to be completed. This has several steps to verify no fire is started or could start later after hot work is complete. \n\n\u0095\tManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed and approved.\n\n\u0095\tIncident Investigation: The procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly. Any recommendations from the investigation are resolved to improve the prevention program."
