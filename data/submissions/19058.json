      "SummaryText": "Mayport Farmers Coop operates three anhydruous ammonia storage and transfer facilties.  These facilities are located at Portland Junction ND, SW Portland ND, and NE Mayville ND.  Anhydrous ammonia is a vital  part of our farming culture, farmers use anhydrous ammonia as an input to improve crop quality and yield.  While accidents can happen at any type of storage facility,  Mayport Farmers Coop takes steps to insure that this material is handled in the safest possible manner.\n\nMayport Farmers Coop trains its employees in the most recent techniques developed by the ammonia industry to insure employee and environmental safety.  Training is held on an annual basis and is coordinated with two local fire departments in the area:  Portland Fire Department and Mayville Fire Department.  In addition, a local emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local fire departments and county emergency planning commitee for the unlikely event of a leak.\n\nMayport Farmers Coop has never had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  To insure that this excellent record continues Mayport Farmers Coop maintains it's epuipment with public and environmental safety in mind, replacing epuipment with only approved parts.  Inspections are conducted to insure that all epuipment remains in good repair. \n\nMayport Farmers Coop's main concern is safety and will continue to take the steps neccessary to insure that this material is handled in the safest possible manner."
