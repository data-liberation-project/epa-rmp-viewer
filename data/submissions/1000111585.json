USEN ensures that all facility personnel who will be conducting hot work are familiar with all procedures and safety requirements.\n\nContractors:\nThe objective of the Contractor Safety program is to ensure that all contractors working at the USEN site are properly qualified, understand potential hazards of the Aerosol Recycling Unit and the site in general, are trained in the site's safe work practices, and are informed about the site-specific Emergency Contingency Plan. The procedures apply to all non-USE workers required to perform physical work within the facilities operation boundaries. The safety records and practices of all contractors are assessed prior to work on the ARU. Contractors are mandated to various trainings on the above topics.\n\nTrade Secrets:\nThe facility is diligent in its development of all documentation relating to processes covered by the CAPP/RMP/PSM programs. Therefore, information necessary for the development, implementation, and integration of the safety programs are provided to those involved in the program regardless of trade secret status.\n\nEmergency Response Plan:\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 265 Subpart D, US Ecology Nevada maintains and strictly follows an Emergency Contingency Plan containing all elements mandated by 40 CFR 265.52. This plan is developed and annually reviewed under the direction of the facility Health and Safety Manager and further designates Emergency Coordinators (EC). Employees will immediately notify the EC upon identifying a fire, explosion or release of hazardous waste or constituents which could threaten human health or the environment.\n\nUpon notification and verification that one of these events has occurred, the EC will implement the Contingency Plan, and delegate responsibilities to other Facility employees (examples could include the Laborator"

The PSSR Procedure will assure that appropriate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place, and will verify that process hazard analysis (PHA) and management of change (MOC) have been performed as required by regulation. The PSSR will be implemented prior to the initial startup of the Aerosol Recycling Operation, and thereafter if required by MOC.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nThe Compliance Audit includes reviews/inspections of existing documentation, policies and procedures, and supporting records to determine the quality of program implementation for the facility. Personnel interviews are performed, as necessary, to assist in verifying that documentation and records provided are accurate and to demonstrate the awareness and participation of the facility\u2019s personnel.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nThe USEN Accident & Incident Investigation Program exists to outline the procedures required for reporting, documenting, and investigating incidents. Emphasis is placed on determining cause and ensuring prevention against reoccurrence.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nThe Employee Participation Program defines the different mechanisms available to employees to assist in all health and safety programs at the Beatty Facility. Site employees play a critical part in identifying risks as well as system improvement across the entire facility. The program applies to all employees at the facility, and all employees are strongly encouraged to participate through the site\u2019s employee health and safety recognition program. \n\nHot Work Permits:\nThis component sets general requirements for issuing a Hot Work Permit and ceasing a Hot Work Permit.

SOPs contain sections of safety and health considerations, special or unique hazards. They also refer to the SDS sheets for more information and control measures to be taken if exposure occurs. They also detail the PPE required to prevent exposure. SOPs also include sections for safety systems and their functions, and, in some cases, quality control of raw materials.\n\nTraining:\nSpecific training for personnel involved in the operation of the ARU/Tank Farm has been developed in the Aerosol Recycling Operation Training Program. This is additional to the general Personnel Training Program. The team determines all appropriate training subjects have been identified and appropriate training methods have been developed by interviewing personnel and reviewing training methods applied for gaps in understanding.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThe USEN Mechanical Integrity Program validates PSI and applies it to the implementation of a robust program of preventative maintenance. Tasks, and frequencies are based on vendor manuals and applicable codes and standards. When the equipment does not have a vendor O&M manual, the PMs have been developed based on recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) and/or facility experience. Preventative maintenance and corrective maintenance activities are scheduled, tracked, and documented.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that changes in operating practices, facility changes, new or modified equipment, process changes or new processes do not introduce an unrecognized or unacceptable hazard, or compromise the safeguards built into the Aerosol Recycling Operation.  Management of Change (MOC) is a structured approach which ensures that these"

The team works together to ensure PSI is kept current and made available to all personnel. This includes technology of the process and the equipment in the process (SDS, Process Flow Diagrams, EOM manuals, relief design information, process chemistry, and equipment OEMs, including permissible flows and operating limits).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nThe Process Hazard Analysis is an organized and systematic assessment of the potential hazards associated with an industrial process. This is accomplished through methodologies including Hazard and Operability Study, What-if, Checklists, or a combination of these. The PHA considers hazards of the process; any previous incident that had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, including, without limitation, near misses or accidental releases; engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases; consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls; facility siting; human factors; external forces; and a qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on employees in the workplace. Recommendations are tracked in a PHA recommendation log and the recommendations are shared with the employees affected by the recommendation as part of scheduled training in the Training Program.

      "SummaryText": "US Ecology Nevada Executive Summary:\nPropane Utilized in the Aerosol Recycling Unit\n\nUS Ecology Nevada (USEN) is a hazardous waste disposal facility located remotely in the Amargosa Desert in Nye County, Nevada. The Facility is located on a 480-acre site, which is leased from the State of Nevada. The nearest resident is approximately 11 miles away in Beatty, Nevada, the closest town. USEN utilizes about 160 acres for active operations, which include the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes regulated by both the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Additionally, USEN operates an aerosol can recycling process. The Aerosol Recycling Unit (ARU) processes collected aerosol cans by separating the contents from the metal in a crusher, and isolating out the propellant, which is a flammable mixture consisting primarily of propane. The propane is then stored in tanks for beneficial re-use. \n\nThe Aerosol Recycling Unit, its storage tank farm, and all interconnected piping are processes covered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Risk Management Program rule (RMP), OSHA\u2019s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and the State of Nevada\u2019s Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP). The threshold quantity for propane in all programs is 10,000 lbs.; the maximum intended inventory of propane at the USEN Aerosol Recycling Unit is 32,000. \n\nProtecting the safety of people, the community and the environment is a core value of the company; the facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and in its dedication to the practices that keep its employees and the neighboring communities safe. In December 2023, the facility was recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a \u201cStar\u201d worksite within OSHA\u2019s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  The VPP program establishes a cooperative relationship between management, employees, and OSHA and is driven by exemplary commit"
