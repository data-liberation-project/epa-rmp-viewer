      "SummaryText": "The Coffeyville, Kansas Water Treatment Facility is located in Montgomery County, Kansas and is situated in a semi-remote area at the north end of the city. The facility is surrounded on three (3) sides by very steep and tall hills which provide a buffer between the plant and neighboring residential areas in the event that a leak or rupture of the chlorine cylinders at the plant should occur. Just east of the facility is the Verdigris River which is the source of water for the city. In the event of a large rupture or leak of a chlorine cylinder, the river is the most likely avenue the gas would follow.\n\nThe facility currently  uses one-ton cylinders to deliver chlorine for water treatment. The cylinders are stored in an isolated concrete block room, only accessible from an outside door. The maximum amount of cylinders stored in the room is six(6) with generally only four(4) stored at any given time. The chlorine is transported by a vacuum system to prevent any leaks. The facility is equipped with emergency power, a SCBA, automatic and manual shutoffs, and a light and horn system activated by automatic clorine sensors.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies of the facility are consistent with industry standards. The personnel at the facility strictly adhere to safety and maintenance protocol to ensure that all the equipment is operating safely and efficiently. In the event that an emergecy occurs, the policy of the facility is to notify the Coffeyville Fire Department and to assist them as necessary.\n\nModeling of the worst-case and alternate-case scenarios for the facility was achieved by utilizing the RMP*Comp and the Landview III software. Though the facility is surrounded on three sides by large hills and there are many obstructions to the spread of a chlorine leak, the surrounding area was determined to be rural for the modeling. This provided a more conservative model than selecting urban and it was felt that if a leak did occur, it w"

The resulting plume for the worst-case scenario was determined to have a 2.2 mile radius which encompases approximately two-thirds of the city.  The number of people within 2.2 miles of the facility is approximately 8,224(as determined by Landview III) and these people would  possibly be affected if there was a catastrophic chlorine release at the facility. The alternate-case scenario was modeled by assuming that there was a valve leak and that the release rate would be 10.5 lbs/min for 60 minutes. The scenario resulted in a plume of appoximately 0.1 miles. According to Landview III, with no one living within this radius.\n\nThe accidental release and prevention program at he facility consists of all the requirments as specified in 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level2 processes. The facility\"s plan includes regular training for the facility personnel as to safety and maintenance, keeping up-to-date MSD sheets, performing regular maintenance of the regulated process, and utilizing technological safeguards such as the vacuum pumping system, leak detection equipment, and system feed equipment.\n\nTo date, the Coffeyville, Kansas Wter Treatment Plant has maintained an exemplary accidental history. There have been no reportable accidents at the facility for over five(5) years. The facility is currently manned by six(6) full time employees overseen by Chuck Shively(Director) and Earl Menefee(Asst. Supt.).\n\nThe emergency response program currently in place consists of a coordinated effort between the treatment facility employees and the Coffeyville Fire Department. The emergency response plan is consistent with the National Response Team\"s Intergrated Contingency Plan Guidelines (\"One Plan\") The plan contains procedures for notifying the public and emergency response agencies, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment, procedures for"
