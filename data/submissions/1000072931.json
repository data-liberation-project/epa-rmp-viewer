Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 4,220 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4.2\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.3 miles from the point of release.

Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \r\n\r\n1.1.2.\tSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\n1.1.3.\tWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tFacility Description And Substances Handled\r\n\r\n1.2.1\tReser's Fine Foods, Inc. is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods. Production requires the use of two refrigeration systems to preserve the integrity of processed foods. These refrigeration processes use ammonia as a refrigerant.
