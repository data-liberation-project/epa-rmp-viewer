      "SummaryText": "Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Champaign, Illinois has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time data base to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Champaign Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nAt this location Kraft Foods  manufactures  processed cheese, pourable and spoonable salad dressings, and pasta dinners.  The SIC codes for the  primary processes at this facility are 2022, 2035 and 2098.  The facility is divided into east and west side production units.  The east side consists of two production units, frozen macaroni and cheese processing and the other for processed cheese (single slices, etc.).  The west side consists of three (3) production units 1) pourable salad dressings, 2) spoonable salad dressings, and 3) pasta dinners.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the ingredients and finished products.  Some of these areas include: receiving, processing, and other storage areas. \r\n\r\nKraft Foods has one regulated substances under 40 CFR 68: i.e., ammonia, at this location.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas described above.\r\n\r\nThe  ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 130,500 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Foods in Champaign, IL\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release"

      "SummaryText": "Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM  program for  their  ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\nSince most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nThe plant  maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 2009 - June 23, 2014.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response program which complies with the OSHA standard and contains procedures for:\r\n\r\nEmergency escape\r\nEmployees and accounting of all employees\r\nRescue and medical duties\r\nReporting\r\nEmergency notification (Champaign Fire Department)\r\nAlarm systems\r\nEvacuation, and\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAs part of the emergency notification procedures, the Champaign Fire Department will be called to provide first emergency responders, equipment, and service.  The Champaign Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where the fire department is called, an ambulance will also be called to the scene.\r\n\r\nThis HAZWOPER and Emergency Response plan addresses all the above mentioned procedures in detail.  This level of detail makes the emergency response program at Kraft Champaign a thorough and comprehensive program.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBased on the \"what-if/chec"
