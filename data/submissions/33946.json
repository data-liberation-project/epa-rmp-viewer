Accidental Release and emergency response policies\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) requirements mandated in Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 20, 1996.  These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nThe Sistersville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Sistersville's written safety and environmental policy state that Safety is unequivocally our number one priority.  Sistersville has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous chemicals.  Should a release occur, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.     \n\t\n\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sistersville plant is a silicone chemical producing facility located at 3500 South State Route 2 in Friendly, West Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 1400 acres in southern Tyler County.  An environmental remediation firm and an aluminum dross-recycling firm to the south, the Ohio River to the west, a rural residential area to the north and undeveloped forestland to the east occupy the immediate area surrounding the facility.\n\n   Silicone chemicals have been manufactured at the facility since the mid-1950s.  The Sistersville plant makes a variety of silicone products, which fall into three general categories: urethane additives, silicone fluids and silanes.  The products are utilized in a broad spectrum of industry.  The facility is operated 24 hours a day, seven da"

Plant manufacturing areas are broken down into four areas: Polymers I, Polymers II, New Product Development and Silanes.       \n\nSistersville produces silicone chemicals at the Sistersville plant.  As defined by the regulations, the Sistersville plant stores the following toxic chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities: anhydrous ammonia, acrylonitrile, ethylenediamine, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, 37% hydrochloric acid, methyltrichorosilane, dimethyldichorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane.  The plant stores the following flammable chemicals above threshold quantities as defined by the regulation: dimethylamine, and trichlorosilane.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\n\tThe Sistersville plant maintains a rigorous Process Safety Management program, which satisfies all applicable requirements of both OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Rule 40 CFR 68. The facility maintains policies/programs, which address required program elements as follows:\n\nEmployee Participation- The facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention programs.  Examples include participation in Process Hazard Analysis, operating procedure development, incident investigations, unsafe condition reporting, Central Safety team meetings, management of change reviews, etc.  \n\nProcess Safety Information- Process safety information is compiled prior to beginning any Process Hazard Analysis, Differential Process Hazard Analysis or  revalidation effort to assure proper documentation is available for review teams utilization during the Process Hazard Analysis process.  Process safety information is kept evergreen through the utilization of the management of change process as well as periodic internal and corporate audit verifications.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)- The facility maintain"

A management system is in place to document and track PHA actions to timely completion, assigning resources as needed to maintain demonstrable progress.\n\nOperating Procedures- The facility maintains a procedure for construction of operating procedures, which includes all requirements specified by OSHA and EPA.  Annual reviews are conducted as required.  Operating procedures are reviewed and updated as required by the management of change process and through suggestions made by operators.\n\nTraining- The facility maintains a written and walkthrough training program for operations, maintenance and distribution personnel.  Facility personnel undergo training on OSHA, EPA and DOT required subjects on an ongoing basis.  Operations and maintenance personnel have received both overview training as well as specific process hazards overview training.  Refresher training is conducted every three years.\n\nContractors- The facility maintains a contractor qualification program, which meets all OSHA and EPA requirements.  Contractors receive hazard identification training prior to commencement of work and are monitored by the internal auditing program to assure compliance with all OSHA, EPA and Witco standards.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews- The facility maintains an active program to perform pre-startup safety review on all changes to assure that all phases of the change have been installed correctly, personnel trained as required, and maintenance procedures are in place to safely maintain the equipment. \n\nMechanical Integrity- The facility maintains an extensive mechanical integrity program, which covers not only regulated equipment but also all other equipment at the site.

As part of this program, we have developed and implemented written programs to train all of our employees in the proper response to an incident.  We have also developed and trained more extensively a smaller number of employees to act as an emergency brigade to provide more expertise in responding to more significant events both on and off site.  We have equipped this brigade with equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site. Our trained fire brigade and medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries and other emergency response organizations in the immediate area.\n\nMutual aid agreements are in place with the local fire depratments in Sistersville and St. Mary's West Virginia.  The site brigade also closely works with these departments to help train new fire fighters as the need arises.\n  \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\n\n\tSistersville has several elements of the management system of the accident prevent program in place to continue to improve safety throughout the facility.
