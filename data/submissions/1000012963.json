      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOconee County Sewer Commission\n\nThe Oconee County Sewer Commission of Seneca, South Carolina (OCSC) accident release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. This complies with all the applicable requirements of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP). The OCSC Rick Management Program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility.\n\nThe Coneross Waste Treatment Plant is a facility owned by the OCSC that exceeds the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119) threshold limit of 1500 pounds of Chlorine (CAS:007782-50-5). These facilities are manned and are required by 1910.119 to establish a PSM program. The OCSC has implemented a PSM program that is unique to this facility. Presently, the facility exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 pounds of chlorine established by CAA 112r, therefore, the facility has implemented a Risk Management Program based on CAA 112r Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe facility uses many technological and managerial practices that are not unique, in fact are common in the water-wastewater treatment industry. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the facility in ton cylinders and placed in a tank storage area. Gaseous Chlorine, collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperature, is piped off by a vacuum chlorinating system and injected into  plant utility water to form a solution of hypochlorite. The solution is piped to contact chambers for the purpose of disinfecting wastewater. The equipment at this facility includes a tank storage area, chlorinator room that contains the chlorinators, feed indicators, various safety equipment, and electrical panels. A complete listing of equipment, along with block flow diagrams, and pipe and instrumentation diagrams are included in the OCSC PSM for the facility.\n \nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e offsite consequence analysis, required by CAA, includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling based on EPA RMP*COMP V1.06 was performed for the facility. This program was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 PPM, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\"."
