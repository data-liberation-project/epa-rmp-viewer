We are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures are needed.\n\nDescription of the Facility Information and Regulated Substances handled\n\n(b)    FXI-Foamex Innovations, Inc. is located at 154 Lipford Rd in the Lee Industrial Park South in Verona, MS.  The facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, primarily for the furniture and bedding industry, and handles mixed isomers of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  TDI is regulated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments.\n\nThe same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance. TDI is considered a toxic substance and associated safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as fire, explosion, or toxic release of TDI is possible. \n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Specific Prevention Steps\n\n(c)    FXI uses this RMP and FXI best management practices as the primary programs for defining and guiding the Accidental Release Prevention Program for the facility.  The facility has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program (Level 2) due to the following factors:\n    1.    TDI is listed on CAA 112(r) and our process "

This facility is not eligible for Program  Level 1 because our worst-case release scenario for TDI indicates a potential to impact public receptors within our toxic endpoint distance.  \n    3.    This facility is not subject to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Standard in that TDI is not listed on OSHAA?s list of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Consequently, our covered process is not subject to Program Level 3.\n\nOur accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following seven (7) functions:\n\n    1.    Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment.\n    2.    Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, process, and procedures.\n    3.    Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that used regulated substances.\n    4.     Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs.\n    5.    Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes.\n    6.    Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule.\n    7.    Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the company to help prevent recurrence.\n\nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, hu"

Magnetically coupled pumps used for transfer also include spring loaded safety relief valves and/or high pressure cut off switches to give additional protection.\n    e.    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n    f.    TDI railcar inner tank is surrounded by an outer shell filled with insulation and a steam jacket.\n    g.    TDI railcars are top loaded through a nozzle in the top of the tank.\n    h.

A valve from a manifold was incorrectly positioned.  The incorrect configuration filled and overflowed a tank which had been used with an older delivery system. This overfill led to the release outdoors. The release was contained by our Spill Containment system.  We reported the release in the 5 year accident history section of the RMP as a record of the event.  The event is recorded even though the release was contained and no property damage, injuries, evacuations, or death occurred.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n(e)    We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.

This will further assist in determining if a magnetic gauge has developed a problem before an accident or an inventory inaccuracy occurs.\n        3.
