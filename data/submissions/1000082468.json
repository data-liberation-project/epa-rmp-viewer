Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe ConAgra Foods Packaged Foods, LLC facility located in Hagerstown, Maryland is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If a release occurs beyond our control, we evacuate the area per our Emergency Action Plan and summons a trained Hagerstown Fire Department and Washington County HAZMAT Team. \r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility processing plant is used for food manufacturing of meatless products (Gardein).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-looped ammonia refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration onsite, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability (>10,000 lbs.), this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n \r\n3.
