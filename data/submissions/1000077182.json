THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSIST OF 2 STORAGE TANKS (44,000 GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\r\n\r\n       THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 350,000\r\n       POUNDS, THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS. \r\n\r\n3.   THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\r\n      \r\n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario.
