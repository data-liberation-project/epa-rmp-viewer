Periodically the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also  drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\r\n \r\nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia as a regulated toxic. The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance.  Alternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic, which are more likely events, must also be presented. This information can be found onsite.\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The West Point Plant has had no qualifying accidental releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\r\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program/OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis will be conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity program"
