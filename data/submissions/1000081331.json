The release modeling included in the Risk Management Program assumes a more conservative approach by modeling the composition of the flammable mixture to consist of all butane. This would predict a release impacting the largest area. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the KMCC Galena Park Splitter:\n1) Employee Participation\n2) Process Safety Information\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n4) Operating Procedures\n5) Training\n6) Contractor Safety\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n8) Mechanical Integrity \n9) Hot Work \n10) Management of Change\n11) Incident Investigation\n12) Emergency Planning and Response\n13) Compliance Audits\n14) Trade Secrets\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has never had an accident involving the covered process which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe KMCC Galena Park Splitter maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations.
