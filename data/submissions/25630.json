The duration of the release was determined to be 10 minutes since the system could be shut down or the overpressure condition would subside within that time period. Using RMP Comp the distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated at 0.10 miles. From the Landview III data it was determined that 4 people reside within this radius and also includes some commercial and industrial facilities. There are no schools, hospitals or environmental receptors within the one mile radius.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSysco Food Service of Grand Rapids has established a trained, in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of anhydrous ammonia. Training for emergency responders is based on the guidelines set forth by OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER). The facility has also established annual refresher training for all personnel on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant-wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with the Kent County LEPC to establish a joint response program. These plans and procedures are periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nSysco Food Service of Grand Rapids has developed a written Emergency Response Plan and trained the refrigeration operators and selected plant personnel in emergency response to hazardous chemical releases. The trained personnel are expected to assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt to initiating a system shutdown. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system including procedures for the emergency shutdown and isolation of equipment should a release occur.

Emergency response assistance is coordinated with local emergency agencies and the Kent County LEPC.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThere have been no reportable accidental ammonia releases within the past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSysco Food Service has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to insure the ammonia refrigeration system is maintained in a safe and efficient manner and facility employees are properly trained in the safe operation of this system. In addition the facility follows the following codes, standards and guidelines to maintain the mechanical integrity of the covered process:\n\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration\nASHRAE Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\nANSI/IIAR 2-1999 Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\nNFPA Guidelines for Fire Protection Equipment\n\nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, and testing and inspection programs, Sysco Food Service of Grand Rapids has established a history of safe operation, community emergency action plans are current and training with community services is conducted for a safe response in the event of an accidental release."

      "SummaryText": "Sysco Food Service of Grand Rapids is a general line grocery wholesaler located at 3700 Sysco Court SE, Grand Rapids, MI. Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to maintain perishable and frozen product.\n\nThe refrigeration system at the Grand Rapids facility is a two-stage, closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side pressure of 0 psig to a high side pressure of 165 psig. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one time has been calculated at 18, 000 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario data for a Toxic Substance:\n\nOur worst-case release scenario was determined to be a failure of the vessel with the largest quantity in our refrigeration system. This vessel is the Recirculator Vessel  (A6) which measures 48 x 144 and has a maximum capacity of approximately 6,150 pounds. Since an overfill condition of the Recirculator could result in vessel failure, the worst-case release scenario is based on releasing the entire contents, at 100%, in 10 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint was computed using RMP Comp, taking into consideration the Engine Room enclosure as passive mitigation, and was determined to be a radius of 1.00 miles. Landview III was used to determine population totals and public and environmental receptors within this radius. From the Landview III data it was determined that 639 people reside within this radius and also includes some commercial and industrial facilities. There are no schools, hospitals or environmental receptors within the one mile radius.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Data for a Toxic Substance:\n\nA release from a pressure relief valve (PRV) was chosen for our alternative release scenario since it is probably the most likely event that would result in an ammonia release. For this model a relief valve on the high side of the system (250 lb. set point) was selected with a release rate of 60 lbs. per minute. The quantity released was calculated using IIAR's formula for"
