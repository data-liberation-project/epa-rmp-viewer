The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, yogurt, and milk products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Price?s Creameries is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, thes"
