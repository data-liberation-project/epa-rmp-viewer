Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (EGTS) operates the facility which is owned by Eastern Gathering and Processing, Inc. (EGP).\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nEGTS is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is EGTS's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. EGTS has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil/Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise. Also, EGTS will contact the Lewis County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nStationary Source, Regulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nLEP is a natural gas extraction plant that receives raw natural gas and processes it to remove free liquids from the gas. The gas is compressed and dehydrated utilizing a molecular sieve bed. After dehydration the pressure is reduced, and the gas is cooled through the expander side of the expander/compressor. The gas is sent to an absorber where liquids condense and fall to the bottom. The overhead gas is warmed, compressed, and sent back "

The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in a process in an amount that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) for applicability under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements. No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are present at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nEGTS has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. LEP was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3. LEP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is classified as a Program 3 process under USEPA's RMP. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - EGTS personnel maintain a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the regulated process. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors or importers to provide SDSs to communicate the hazards of hazar"

EGTS primarily uses the What-If and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these hazard evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, EGTS maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining - EGTS has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Initial employee training is provided, and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented, and a record of training is maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for mainta"

Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper operation and maintenance. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. LEP also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. These procedures are updated as needed. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of any process changes and are offered training to deal with modifications.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LEP. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and installed equipment meet design specifications, and that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits are conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly implemented. The audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every three years. Audit findings a"
