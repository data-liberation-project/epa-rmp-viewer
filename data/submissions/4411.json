Chlorine is the only regulated substance subject to the CFR 40 Part 68 at Dry Creek. \nThe company has in place, annual mandatory chlorine safety training for all employees who work at the plant. Additionally, specific training is required in all aspects of the operation of the chlorine process for those who operate the process. Training in maintenance and repair of the chlorine process equipment is conducted with all employees who are required to maintain and repair any part of the system.\nDecatur Utilities has developed a Chlorine Emergency Response Program to fulfill the requirements of OSHA Part 1910.38. The emergency response program is coordinated with the local and state emergency response plan.\n Part 68.155 Section B\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Dry Creek Treatment Plant has one stationary source capable of holding 12 one ton containers of chlorine gas. The combined piping and containers may hold a maximum of 24,028 pounds of chlorine gas. The covered process consist of piping, as per th"

Additionally, the rate of release and endpoints corresponding to the above scenarios were derived from EPA CEPP, RMP Series, Risk Management for Wastewater Treatment Plants, and EPA's RMP Comp.**\n Worst Case Release Scenario\nThis scenario was modeled as a direct release over a 10 minute period, as required by the regulations. It involves catastrophic failure of a one ton container due to impact, corrosion, or construction defect. The entire contents of a full container, 2,000 pounds, is released over a ten minute period at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.* The toxic endpoint was modeled as 1.3 mile radius in all directions from the point of release.** The affected population was estimated at 910.***\n\n   \n\n\n\nPart 68.155 Section C\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\nThis scenario assumes release of chlorine gas through 20 foot of 1 inch schedule 80 pipe due to complete failure of the pipe. The scenario assumes that the pressure in the pipe is approximately 97.5 pounds per square inch, which is the vapor pressure of chlorine at 77 degrees F. It also assumes that the rate of release is limited by the pipe dimensions and not by any valve or opening upstream of the release. The release is from an infinite source (e.g., 6 or more ton containers). The release duration is 60 minutes at an average release rate of 72 lb/min. The total release is 4,320 pounds with a toxic endpoint of 0.8 miles. The populati"

The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to the various RMP management group.\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered process and maintenance employees in accordance with CFR 40 Part 68.48. Safety information includes current MSDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedure and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\nProcess Hazard Analysis \nA hazard analysis has been performed for the program II covered process. A check list was used based on The Chlorine Institute's, The Chlorine Manual, pamphlet 1, 6th edition, January 1997. Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safeguards in place to prevent a release. The process hazard analysis was documented and will be updated every five-years.\nOperating Procedures  \nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees. Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown. Process limits were reviewed and documented. Emergency first aidl care for chlorine exposures are outlined and included in training. \n\n\n\n\n\nTraining \nChlorine safety training and Red Cross first aid and CPR training is mandatory for all plant employees and is conducted annually.

Documentation of employee attendance at all training sessions are maintained for a period of not less than 5 years.\nMechanical Integrity   \nAll process equipment, piping, ventilation system, monorail and hoist, have a documented schedule of inspection, and preventive and periodic maintenance. All maintenance inspection and testing on chlorine process equipment is conducted as per manufacturer's recommendations and is consistent with accepted engineering practices. Any deficiencies identified during such maintenance and inspection are addressed in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 68.58 Compliance Audits\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years in accordance with this part.
