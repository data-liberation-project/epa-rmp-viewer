The products covered by EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) at this site are:\n\u2022\tSulfur dioxide (anhydrous): bulk sulfur dioxide railcars are used to package smaller containers of sulfur dioxide.\n\u2022\tChlorine: bulk chlorine railcars are used to package smaller containers of chlorine and in the manufacture of bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Chlorine is also regulated by OSHA Process Safety Management regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\u2022\tAqueous Ammonia: vendor bulk trailers are used to package smaller containers of aqueous ammonia.\n\nPrevention Program: Accident prevention is achieved through safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chlorine, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and aqueous ammonia during receipt, storage and repackaging. This starts with DOT FRA approved railcars that are robustly designed to contain these products through expected conditions during transport, storage and unloading. It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely transfer chemicals during manufacture.  \n\n5-year Accident History: There has not been an accident involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), or aqueous ammonia at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response: In the event of a maintenance issue with chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or aqueous ammonia equipment/railcar/tanker trailer, employees are trained on how to detect the source of the issue and take appropriate action such as closing or tightening a valve. If an accidental release should occur, this facility has a trained on-site hazmat team including proper equipment (SCBA and C-kits) to respond.
