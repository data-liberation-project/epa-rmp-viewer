      "SummaryText": "The City of Newberg is committed to safety and health of employees, the public and the environment.  By preparing this Wastewater Treatment Plant Risk Management Plan, the City of Newberg is continuing it's  ongoing program to reduce the risk from chlorine use at the facility.  Risk management planning begins with a strong safety program to prevent or minimize the potential for accidents at the plant.  The City's Safety manual details chlorine handling procedures and other accident prevention methods used at the plant.  As a result of routine application of this program the plant has an excellent safety record.  In over 25 years of operation it has never experienced a chlorine incident.\n\n\n\nChlorine Use\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect wastewater at the plant.  Chlorine is delivered and stored under pressure in specially manufactured, welded steel cylinders.  Each cylinder contains 2000 pounds of chlorine.  After delivery cylinders are stored on special supports inside a room specifically designed for this purpose.  Depending on the amount needed at the plant, up to four cylinders may be stored, plus one in use at any time. Chlorine gas contained in these cylinders is transferred to metering equipment where it is dissolved in water. Chlorine in solution is then transferred to points in the treatment plant where it is applied to wastewater for disinfection and other purposes.  There is an important safety feature of the equipment used at the Wastewater Plant; namely, chlorine gas is drawn into solution by vacuum rather than being forced by pressure.  As a result, the system will shut down in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nIn preparing the RMP, the City of Newberg performed an assessment of the potential offsite affects of an accidental release of chlorine at the plant.  For planning purposes two release scenarios were evaluated.  The worst Case scenario is intended to estimate the maximum possible distance from the treatment plant that chlorine coul"

An alternative, more reasonable scenario is also presented.\n\n\n\nUnder the worst-case scenario, it is assumed that a full chlorine cylinder is dropped while being unloaded at the plant's receiving area.  As a result it ruptures and releases its contents to the atmosphere.  For this circumstance the estimated distance that chlorine could potentially travel is 1.3 miles from the plant site.  Depending on wind direction, this 1.3 miles could be in any direction.\n\n\n\nA written protocol is rigorously followed during chlorine deliveries to prevent such an accident from occurring.  Nevertheless, for the condition of the worst-case incident, potential off site affects include an area with 5,500 residents, two schools, four city parks, one animal shelter,one hospital,12 semi industrial small businesses, the Waste Management garbage depot, airport, recreational users at the Willamette river and the SP Fibre Tech Plant.\n\n\n\nA More reasonable scenario assumes that a valve on one of the chlorine cylinders stored in the chlorine room breaks.  As a result, chlorine gas leaks through the broken valve into the room.  In this case, the valve opening and building enclosure retard release to the outside air and reduce the offsite distance that chlorine could potentially travel to 0.25 mile.  Again, depending on wind direction this .10 mile could be in any direction.  For conditions of the alternative scenario, potential offsite effects include 10 residents and the the airport, animal shelter, recreational users at the Willamette river and SP Fibre Tech Plant during operating hours.\n\n\n\nA third potential scenario was created with the installation of a 1000 lb propane tank with in 50 foot of the chlorine building.  In the opinion of the Fire Marshal this created a potential explosion energy source that would damage the integrity of the Chlorine Building and the chlorine tanks within.  To prevent such a blast a concrete jersey barrier was"

      "SummaryText": " installed next to the propane tank to deflect blast energy up and away from the chlorine building.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Prevention Practices\n\nMany accident prevention practices are in place at the treatment plant including those specified by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in it's Process Safety management (PSM) standard. Key prevention practices include written protocols which plant personnel are trained to rigorously follow when chlorine is delivered to the plant site and when cylinders are connected to metering equipment.  Routine inspection and maintenance inside the plant's chlorine storage room.  Initial training related to safe handling of chlorine is provided to operators of the chlorine system and training is verified and documented as part of the accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe treatment plant's emergency action plan is integrated with the City's community wide Emergency Operation Plan (EOP). EOP covers a wide range of potential emergency situation.  It identifies the succession of authority, command structure and evacuation and other procedures to be followed during an emergency.  In the event of a chlorine accident at the plant, plant personnel will immediately call 911 to notify Newberg Fire and Police Departments.  Dispatch will alert the Newberg Fire Department and then contact the hospital, CS Lewis School and the Newberg Animal Shelter on Wynooski Rd, residents of Dog Ridge Rd and Wynooski Rd, the Newberg Airport,the Safety Director and the SP Fibre Tech Plant.  The Fire Department will request aid from the Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue Hazardous Materials Response Team to respond to the chlorine release.   All plant personnel, visitors and contractors will evacuate the treatment plant immediately upon notification of the accident and assemble at a point off the plant site near the exit gate at the southeast corner of the plant and upwind of the accident location. The supervisor on site is expected to "

Each individual should report to the plant's Emergency Response Coordinator (Operation Supervisor) who is responsible for accounting for all individuals on site.  Individuals are to remain at the assembly location and wait for further instructions.  The Police chief will assume overall incident Command from the plant supervisor during the emergency and as such will receive full cooperation from all other City Departments. The Plant supervisor shall begin emergency system shut down procedures and then provide the Police Chief with a list of what systems were shut down.  No restart procedures shall commence until both Tualatin Valley Fire and the IC Police Chief have given the Plant Supervisor permission to restart the plant systems. "
