      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1992 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\nThe Shute Creek Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it.  Additional details are included in other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThis facility, located 33 miles Northeast of Kemmerer, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce methane, sulfur, carbon dioxide, helium from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This facility could contain regulated flammable and regulated toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation (i.e., up to 340,000 pounds"

Transportation of regulated flammables and toxics is handled into the facility via pipeline and out of the facility via trucks and pipelines.  This facility is surrounded by high plains desert.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) - \nThe flammable WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of a propane from the refrigeration system resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The flammable WCS could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area does not include any public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe toxic WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of hydrogen sulfide involving the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The toxic WCS has some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes several public receptors and no environmental receptors.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - \nThe flammable ARS is a release of refrigerant propane from flash drum drain valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).

No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS.  The flammable ARS could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area does not include any public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe toxic ARS is a release of hydrogen sulfide from an unlit flare.  Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., flare pilot flame monitored by infrared flame detectors and video surveillance as well as periodic inspections and routine monitoring by operating personnel), the volume of toxic substance was assumed to be released in 5 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The toxic ARS could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area does not include any public or environmental receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at this facility.  Because processes at the facility regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to (and in compliance with) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation -\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each program element.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Engineering group on-site is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level).  This facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThis facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) -\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, this facility updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.
