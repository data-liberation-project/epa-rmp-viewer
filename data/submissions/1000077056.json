Of Milroy\n\n602 Euclid Ave.,P.O.Box 100\n\nMilroy,MN.56263\n\n\n\nFor further information contact; Rick Anderson, General Manager.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan-Executive Summary\n\nThe Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Coop of Milroy are committed to the prevention\n\nof any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occure, the facility is\n\nprepared to work with the local fire department, the local First Responders and other authorities to mitigate\n\nany release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, storage of pesticides and\n\ncustom application, all for sale to farm customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored and distributed to, or picked up by farmers.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 412,000 pounds in storage and nurse tanks.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total of a 30,000 gallon storage tank of\n\nanhydrous ammonia in ten minutes time with the maximum quantity released being 132,000 pounds, which\n\nrepresents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the\n\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.21 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on a most likely potential incident, which could be a release from a\n\nbreak in a 3 inch pipe lasting two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) \n\nis .78 miles.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the rules and provisions of Minnesota Code of Agency Rules; \"Storage and\n\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", 1513.0010-1513.1100\n\n\n\nThe five year accident history:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anyhydrous ammonia in the past five"
