The process by which crude oil is manufactured into various saleable products (for example, gasoline, propane,  etc.) is known as refining.  Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation methods.  Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances. Regulated flammable substances are present at the Refinery as flammable mixtures. Primary components of the mixtures are propane, butane, pentane and propylene. Secondary components of the mixtures can include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, butene, isobutane, isobutene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 1,3-butadiene, and isopentane. \n\nThe only RMP regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is an impurity in the crude and as the crude is distilled the ammonia is removed and sold as a product. \n\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe section is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP (Risk Management Process) regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analys"

The intent of an investigation is to learn why the incident happened and prevent a recurrence of it or similar incidents. Incident recommendations are tracked to completion.\n \nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Refinery Process Safety Management program is audited periodically to ensure that procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years with an audit team comprised of management and operations personnel.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on file in the Process Safety Management Coordinator's office.\n \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRefinery processes have hazards associated with them that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The Process Safety Management program that has been discussed in this document applies to all processes at the Refinery.  The program activities as a whole reduce the likelihood of accident scenarios that could be due to equipment failure and/or human error.\n\nThe Refinery also has safety features within the process units that are designed to quickly detect, contain and control, and reduce the consequences of the release.

In this process, employees observe each other while performing their daily work for behaviors which might put them at risk for causing an accident.  The employee being observed receives immediate feedback during the observation regarding their performance.  The data from each observation is also collected on a checklist and input into a database.  The data is then used on group and refinery levels to develop action plans to improve behaviors, procedures, and equipment.  Each field employee receives initial and annual refresher training in this process.  Approximately 1000 observations are performed per month.  \n\nThis process is managed by organizational employee steering committees that also provide input on other refinery safety initiatives related to work process improvements and regulatory compliance issues.\n\nSafety Audits\n\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Fire Loss Prevention surveys, Corporate Safety, Fire, and Health Compliance Reviews and Process Safety Management Audit.  These audits/surveys insure that the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations.\n\nSafety Meetings\n\nSafety meetings are held on a routine basis throughout the Refinery and involve all employees as participants and/or presenters.

Most of this information is available electronically for easy access.  Its purpose is to train and inform employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the units. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address each Plant's operational processes including start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, planned shutdown, and the initial start-up of a new plant or after a planned maintenance shutdown.  These procedures are available to operations personnel and serve as a basis for training new operations personnel.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is known as Process Hazards Analysis.  A PHA study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.\n\nThe employer must use one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n-What if\n-What If/Checklist\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n-Fault tree analysis or\n-An appropriate equivalent"

The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) to design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  Management of Change applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \n\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, electrical classification, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an authorization to implement change approval.  A copy of the signed MOC documentation form accompanies all copies of the work request for Operator and Mechanic review.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.
