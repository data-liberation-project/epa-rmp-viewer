      "SummaryText": "The Pawtucket Water Purification Facility is owned by the Pawtucket Water Supply Board (PWSB). Effective February 15, 2004, Earth Tech, Inc. has been contracted to operate the facility. The facility is located in Cumberland, RI at the terminus of the Diamond Hill, Arnolds Mills, Abbot Run, Robin Hollow, and Happy Hollow Reservoir system. The facility provides potable water to over 100,000 people in Pawtucket, Central Falls, and South Cumberland. The facility processes an average of 13 million gallons of water per day. As part of the treatment process, gaseous chlorine is used to eliminate pathogenic bacteria. The chlorine is stored onsite in 9 tanks with a capacity for 2,000 lbs each. The management at Earth Tech is committed to only undertaking activities that we can do without injuring people, damaging property, or impairing the environment. Part of our Safety Management System is to only employ techniques to assist in the recognition, evaluation, and control of hazards at all our projects. All appropriate actions are taken to ensure that these hazards are communicated to our customers, staff and partners that may be impacted. To minimize the likelihood of accidental release of hazardous chemicals, a comprehensive Hazard Communication Program has been implemented as part of the safety and accident prevention program. Elements of this program include: training of all appropriate personnel in the proper handling of chemicals in their respective work areas, development of a worksite inventory of all hazardous substances used at the site, procurement and organization of MSDS for each chemical, proper labeling of all hazardous chemicals according to appropriate regulations, weekly and monthly meetings that cover chemical handling, spill prevention, and emergency preparedness procedures. An Emergency Preparedness Plan has been prepared for the faciliity that identifies emergency notification procedures to employees and the public, additional HAZMAT resources, and standa"

Elements to our prevention program are engineering controls that  includes the use of chlorine sniffers for leak detection, audible and visual alarms, and the use of a complete vacuum system. The most critical element is training all personnel that use chemicals at our worksite to be competent persons. This facility has had no accidental releases over the last five years."
