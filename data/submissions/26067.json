              "Description": "KUB's Accidental Release Prevention Program is based upon OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and addresses these ten elements: Management System, Process Hazard Analysis, Process Safety Information, Standard Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Pre-start up Safety Review, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Employee Participation & Training.  There are Operation & Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment and personnel receive significant training before working on the chlorination system. In addition, there are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for start-up, shut-down, normal operations and emergency operations.  All SOPs are posted in the appropriate areas and are accessible for employees.  Personnel are routinely trained on safety and other general operational procedures as well as emergency response procedures.\n\nPrevention Program Overview:\nKUB?s accidental release prevention program is based upon OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and addresses the following 10 elements tailored to our facility's operations. In accordance with the Process Safety Management provisions incorporated into the Risk Management Program, KUB promotes prevention programs in each of the major areas below: \n\nManagement System\nThe major hazards (e.g., equipment failure, human error, natural phenomena, or a combination of such factors which could lead to a significant accidental release) are identified through the process hazard analysis. The consequences of a failure to control each identified hazard are included in the Process Hazard Analysis documentation for each covered facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe process hazard analysis is the foundation for the remaining elements of the prevention program. KUB?s program uses a team approach and an integrated management system to evaluate the hazards present at the facility and find the best ways to control these hazards. There are various safety and mitigating systems, emergency alarms, and evacuation plans which are utilized to eliminate or reduce the consequences of an off site release.\n\nActive Mitigation Systems/Control Measures\nThe chlorine scrubber system is a once-through, three-stage absorption system designed to contain and safely evacuate a major chlorine leak while maintaining toxic vapor emissions below the Uniform Fire Code requirement of 1/2 the IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value at all times.  To accomplish this, the scrubber removes >99.99% of the toxic vapor in the air while maintaining a negative pressure in the chlorine storage room.  The scrubber system consists of  3 horizontal cross-flow packed bed sections. The caustic storage tank is an integral part of the system and is located below the scrubber adsorber sections. The recirculation pump pulls caustic solution from the storage tank and circulates it through the 3 stages, allowing the vapor-laden gases to be absorbed into the caustic in order to discharge vapor-free air through the stack.  Another safeguard in the system is the use of a chlorine vapor detector, exhaust fans and emergency alarms.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nKUB?s prevention program enables KUB employees involved in Plant Operations to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving the use of chlorine. The process safety information includes material safety data sheets (MSDS), information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine used in plant processes, process flow diagrams, information pertaining to the technology of processes (i.e., process chemistry, process parameters), and information pertaining to the equipment in processes (i.e., equipment specifications and design, piping and instrumentation drawings).\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\nKUB has developed SOPs to document the safe and proper way to operate and maintain processes and equipment, and to handle, use and/or store chlorine at each covered facility.  Procedures are based upon the process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) information, past operating experience, manufacturers' recommendations, and applicable and appropriate codes and standards. Process modification and facility complexity is considered whenever SOPs are developed, reviewed and/or modified.\n\nEmployee Training\nKUB water and wastewater plant personnel  receive HAZWOPER training at the Hazardous Material Technician competency level.  Personnel are trained in all aspects of KUB?s emergency response plan, to include: potential emergencies, personnel roles and responsibilities, evacuation routes and procedures, and the location of emergency response equipment. Trained personnel receive annual refresher training, including emergency response drills and exercises.  Documentation of all training is maintained by KUB?s Learning Center.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nKUB?s preventive maintenance program determines and targets the specific equipment that is identified through the process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) or through operating experience as needed.  The procedures for preventive equipment maintenance, inspection, and testing are documented in the Process Safety Management Program for each of KUB?s facilities that use chlorine.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\nKUB conducts pre-start up safety review to ensure that new or modified equipment is ready to be operated properly and safely, prior to the equipment being placed into service. KUB ensures that safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place by overseeing development of safety and emergency procedures and developing detailed operating and maintenance plans.  KUB personnel are adequately trained and qualified for mechanical management and utilize a computerized work order system.\n\nManagement of Change\nKUB ensures that any alteration of equipment, procedures,, or processes are thoroughly analyzed to identify hazards, the consequences of failures, and impacts of the change on existing equipment, procedures, substances, and processes prior to implementation of the change.\n\nCompliance Audits\nKUB periodically conducts an audit or comprehensive assessment of the management systems and programs at each facility.  This includes a review of the documentation and implementation of the risk management requirements. According to RMP requirements, KUB conducts a complete compliance audit at each covered facility every three years to ensure that the process safety management elements are in place, updated, and being implemented properly.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe final component of KUB?s prevention program consists of investigations to discover the underlying (root) causes of accidents or near miss incidents in order to take steps to prevent accidental releases from recurring. Incident investigation is initiated by the Plant Operations Department, with assistance from the Safety Section of the Human Resources Department and personnel from the Technical Services Department. All investigation reports for actual significant accidental releases will be kept on file for a period of five (5) years.",

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nIn accordance with all provisions of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 of the Clean Air Act Amendments, the Knoxville Utilities Board's Risk Management Plan is an integrated approach to identify and manage the hazards posed by an accidental chlorine release. The Plan is unified by integrating best technologies, procedures and best management practices and adheres to all applicable regulations as required by EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program.  KUB's Prevention Program is based upon the following key elements: \n\nhigh level training for operators; \neffective preventive maintenance; \nuse of state of the art process and safety equipment; \nuse of accurate and effective operating procedures\nperformance of a hazard analysis of process, equipment and procedures, \nand implementation of an effective auditing and inspection program.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Mark B. Whitaker Water Treatment Plant consists of the following processes: mixing, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, pre and post chlorination and pH control. The facility can treat up to 50 MGD of water per day and the maximum storage capacity of chlorine on site is 40,000 pounds.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:\nEach hazard assessment consisted of worse-case and alternative case release scenarios in order to evaluate the potential impacts of accidental releases of chlorine on the public health and environment.\n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe Mark B. Whitaker Plant uses chlorine in 1-ton cylinders, therefore the worst case scenario was based on the assumption that approximately 2000 pounds of chlorine would be released from a cylinder contained within a building.. All calculations for air dispersion modeling were performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped using Landviewer 2000. The worse-case release scenario was evaluated at a release duration of 10 minutes and a release rate of 110 lbs of chlorine/minute.  Air dispersion modeling resulted "

All calculations were performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped by using Landviewer 2000.  The alternative scenario was evaluated at a release duration of 10 minutes and a release rate of 0.0331 lbs/minute (after scrubber). Air dispersion modeling resulted in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 miles.  The maps with overlays depicting this scenario are shown in the Offisite Impact Analysis section of the plan.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nIn the past 5 years there have been no reportable accidents related to a chlorine release However, during the month of May 1999 there was a near miss incident investigated at the facility. The incident involved the failure of a cable during a routine cylinder unloading operation, however this incident did not result in a chlorine release or injuries and there was no property damage. The  investigation revealed the root cause of the incident to be inadequate administrative control procedures and a defective cable. Since that time, steps have been taken to ensure proper procedures and control measures are in place and employees have been trained to prevent future incidents of this nature.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\nKUB's Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the the key elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and addresses these key elements customized to the facility operations: Management System; Process Hazard Analysis; Process Safety Information, Standard Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Pre-startup Safety Review, Management of Change, Compliance Ausits, Incident Investig"

Other safeguards in the system to prevent an accidental release are the use of a chlorine vapor detector, exhaust fans and emergency alarms.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE:\nThe Emergency Response Program is largely based upon the Chlorine Institute's \"Pamphlet 64- Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities\" and is designed to address the specific emerency needs associated with a chlorine release.  Even though the Mark B. Whitaker facility has both passive and active mitigation systems in place to minimize the likelihood of a release, KUB has implemented a comprehensive emergency response plan that is complete, up to date and supplemented with ongoing training and drills for employees. The Plan has been submitted to and reviewed by the Knoxville/Knox County Emergency Planning Committee. In the event of an off site release, the Plan prepares Kub and the Community for a response to, and mitigation of, accidental chlorine releases in order to limit the severity and the impact of such releases on both public health and the environment.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSeveral changes for system reliability and integrity have enhanced process safety at the Mark B. Whitaker Plant.  Several key modifications to the process include enhancements such as automatic shut off valves, additional building enclosures of the chlorniation systems, installation of a chlorine scrubber system, purchase of additional safety equipment (emergency eyewash stations and SCBAs), increased monitoring through the SCADA system and addition of a security alarm system. \n\nThe use of a computerized maintenance management system has helped ensure that all chlorine feed systems, alarm systems, and emergency monitoring systems are adequately maintained. Use of a computerized maintenance management system generates electronic preventive maintenance work orders to ensure the reliability and operability of all process machinery, equipment and supplies.  \n\nThe visual workplace (5S) is one of the fundamental techniques KUB has adopted in a an effort to promote a continuous improvement philosophy. Visual workplace 5 -S provides a method by which employees improve workplace safety, reduce waste, simplify work processes, improve equipment maintenance and troubleshooting, and ensure continuous improvement.  Using the 5-S methodology,  the employees transform their work areas by use of easy to access visual systems based on these 5-S concepts:\n\nSort (Organization) \n?Simplify (Orderliness) \n?Shine (Cleanliness) \n?Standardize \n?Sustain (Self Discipline) \n\nOne of the more recent changes at the facility is evidenced by KUB's support and commitment to safety at the organizational level. This has been accomplished by appointing a Safety Team which will  the implement the Dupont \"STOP\" (Behavioral Safety) Program across all levels of the organization. Team members will work with department managers, supervisors and employees to standardize departmental safety programs, coordinate resources and communicate safety goals and initiatives. An enhance"
