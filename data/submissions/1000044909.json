      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe CoreAgri Plant, Humboldt, Tennessee has Anhydrous Ammonia on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. CoreAgri has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials. The program emphas the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia System (the System) for CoreAgri utilizes anhydrous ammonia to manufacture various fertilizers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only highly hazardous chemical above the PSM threshold quantity on-site.  \n\n\n\nThe System also contains 28% Aqua Ammonia (Aqua Ammonia), a dilution of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Aqua Ammonia is sold as a product or can be used to manufacture other fertilizer products.\n\n\n\nBoth Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. \n\n\n\nThe System maintains a maximum inventory of 22,166 pounds (lbs.) of Anhydrous Ammonia and 65,000 lbs. of  Aqua Ammonia in respective Aboveground Storage Tanks (ASTs).\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release and the alternate release scenarios are delineated below. EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the consequence analyses. The worst case releases are calculated to be a complete release of the contents of the ASTs. \n\n\n\nWorst Case - Anhydrous Ammonia AST Failure\n\n\n\n Amount Released:        22,166 lbs. in 10 minutes     outside.\n\n\n\nWeather Conditions:    77 ?F with a 3.4 mph wind in Class F atmospheric\n\n stability.\n\n\n\nThis release would impact the urban area around CoreAgri within a 1.7 mile radius and impact the entire city of Humboldt, Tennessee, a very small portion of northwest Madison County, Tennessee, approximately a 2 mile section of  Middle Fork of the Forked Deer River southwest"
