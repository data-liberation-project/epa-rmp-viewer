      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe Galena Park Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures. In August 1999 Williams Energy Partners acquired this facility, which has handled Butadiene since 1957 without a harmful release. If an emergency were to occur, it is our written policy to notify the Galena Park LEPC and Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA) and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: \nThe Galena Park Terminal is a ?for hire? bulk liquid storage facility, occupying 196 acres with 108 above ground storage tanks and two pressure vessels. The pressure vessels accommodate the handling of 1,3-Butadiene to receive and deliver Butadiene by pipeline, tankcar, barge and ship. The 1,3-Butadiene tanks are refrigerated for product quality reasons. This is the only regulated process governed by OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the EPA?s Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP. Butadiene storage at the Galena Park Terminal may be storage incident to transportation and may not be regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\nThe Galena Park Terminal?s worst case scenario is the castrophic failure of one 40,000-barrel storage vessels filled to the greatest safe fill amount allowable, releasing approximately 8,400,000 lbs. of refrigerated (38? F) 1,3-Butadiene. Relying on RMP*Comp which was developed by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA., to identify the RMP radius of exposure for a 1 psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1 psi vapor cloud explosion is 1.6 miles fr"

      "SummaryText": "om the center of the explosion resulting from an instantaneous release. \nUsing the LandView III Block Group Centroid Method this scenario calculates that there are 1131 households, 3824 people with the radius.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe Galena Park Terminal's alternative release scenario is the total failure of a 10\" pipeline flange gasket, which would produce 480,000 pounds of released product within a 4 hour time frame and calculated as a BLEVE condition. Relying on RMP*Comp to identify the radius of exposure for a 1 psi overpressure, according to the analyses the greatest maximum end point for this scenario with a vapor cloud explosion is 0.7 miles from the center of the release. Using the LandView III Block Group Centroid Method for calculations there are 63 households, 199 people within the end blast radius. This scenario was used due to the a flange gasket being of a higher probibility of any other scenario, although a total failure is highly unlikely due to the maintenance and operational procedures and checks that are in place.                                                                                                                                                                        \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe Galena Park Terminal is compliant with the thirteen (13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The Butadiene storage and distribution system is governed by OSHA?s PSM regulation, in addition to the U.S. Coast Guard?s 33 CFR Part J 126/127, ?Waterfront Facilities Handling Liquified Hazardous Gas?. The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the tanks and equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere has been no accidental release from the 1,3-Butadiene process at the Galena Park"

Futhermore the Galena Park Terminal has never had an accident involving 1,3-Butadiene that has resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe Galena Park Terminal maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. The terminal is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), in addition to maintaining and being active in the Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA) and Clean Channel Association.\nWithin the past 5 years, the process has no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed and reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nFencing of the flare system associated with the process along with the addition of ingition safeguards are scheduled for the 2003 physical year."
