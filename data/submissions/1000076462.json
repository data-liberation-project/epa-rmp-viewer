If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Spokane County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also have employees on site who are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) to handle small medical emergencies. \n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures carbon composite brakes for the aerospace industry. Propane is stored in one 18,000-gallon tank and one 30,000-gallon tank. The tanks are located approximately 10 feet apart and share common liquid and vapor piping to the facility. The maximum intended inventory is 80% of the combined tank volume.\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario is a failure that results in the release of the entire contents of both tanks if they are filled to the full physical capacity of the tanks, (48,000-gallons) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a pull away explosion that would result from a propane delivery truck driving away without unhooking first and causing a release of the entire 60 foot, 2 inch diameter unloading hose and ignition of the entire 70 foot, 3 inch diameter liquid delivery line. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are not within the distance to the endpoint. \n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The site is actively working on projects within a 5 year window that improve the safety of the covered process. The site will be implementing fire sprinkler protection in the building that houses a portion of the PSM covered process. The underground outlet piping connecting the 18,000 gallon and 30,000 gallon tank will be replaced with above ground pipi"
