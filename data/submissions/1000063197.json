However, they do operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since operations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a chemical release has occurred at the Ridgelawn Facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Sidney Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?    The Hazard Review provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n?    The Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous rel"
