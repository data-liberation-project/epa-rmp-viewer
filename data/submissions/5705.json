Due to our long history in using this chemical many refinements, with safety in mind,  have been made.  Examples of some of these are listed herein.\n\nAn Engineering Consultant has been selected to perform an evaluation of the entire Water Pollution Control Facility for process improvements, since our last upgrade was in 1972.  A high priority item is to review and recommend alternative wastewater disinfection methods instead of the present chlorine gas.  Alternatives such as ultra violet light, sodium hypochlorite, and ozone are some of the alternatives to be evaluated.\n\nSince the Water Pollution Control Facility is located within close proximity to the Town Center, Middle School, Town Hall and Police Facility, the following steps have been implemented.\n\n-Chlorine supply deliveries are made during non-school days.\n-Chlorine dispensing equipment operates on a vacuum system, if there is a break in a supply line the system shuts down.  No chlorine gas can flow.\n-Chlorine supply is stored within an isolated storage building.\n-Two individual leak detection alarms are in operation at all times.  The facility is equipped with an auxiliary power system.\n-Activation of chlorine leak detectors triggers an audible warning buzzer, and interior and exterior warning lights to alert staff.  An additional warning signal may be activated by WPCF staff to warn the school attendees.\n-Superintendent of Sanitation is an active member of LEPC.\n-Annually: The training program consists of WPC staff along with some members of the Fire Department and Highway Department receive Hazardous Materials Technician level site specific certification.\n-Annually:  In house WPC staff training of chlorine, includes videos, review of an emergency plan and a written competency test is given to all participants, as"

If a leak did develop, it would, in all probability, be detected early enough so corrective action can be taken. Although the vulnerability rating may be considered high, the risk rating is low based on pro-active procedures in place."
