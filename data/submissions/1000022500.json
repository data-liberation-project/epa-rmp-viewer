Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\n\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary. \n\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request. We will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employees level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\n\nThe Yankton Terminal was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 6\" pipeline to the Yankton Terminal from the NuStar Terminal in Norfolk, NE. The 2,448,230 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of the nine pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is soored in three bullet tanks. The propane is then pumped to the NuStar Terminal in Wolsey, SD or removed from the site by propane trucks that deliver it to various customers. The refined products are also stored in tanks and pumped to varous customers by trucks.\n\nThe Yankton Facility complies with many different regulator agencies, which include, but not limted to; \n\nOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119)of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nOSHA Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38 (c).\n\nOSHA HAZWOPER Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120\n\nFederal Oil Pollution Act of 1990: U.S. DOT Final Rule for Transportation Related On-Shore Facilities as published in 49CFR Part 194 (Response Plans for Onshore"

We have had no accidental releases in the last five years and to this date we have had no propane releases in the life of the Yankton Terminal.\n\nThe Yankton employees are not first responders, but have receivedtraining in the notification process of the Yankton Fire Department (first responder). The employees also participate in an annual evacuation drill, in the event an evacuation is required.\n\nVarious employees at the Yankton Terminal have received CPR Training and all employees have received annual HAZWOPER training. Numerous other drills are conducted at the Yankton Terminal as stated previously.\n\nSafety is the #1 core value of our company. Whether in performing everyday work or in the planning and maintenance of project work, safety is top priority. Some of the future improvements towards safety are: Management and employees are teaming together to pursue the OSHA VPP Star award. In this pursuit, there are several changes planned to improve safety and some of them are;\n\nQuarterly Hazard Identification audits\n\nElectrical cord quarterly inspections\n\nFirst Use Vehicle Inspections\n\nLift sling(s) quarterly inspections\n\nA new Industrial Hygiene program is being developed\n\nWe are looking at implementing automatic tank gauging which would alleviate the need to climb the tanks on a daily basis."
