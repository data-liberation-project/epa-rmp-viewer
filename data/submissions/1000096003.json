The management of change program requires a four step process: initiation, pre-modification checklist, prestart up safety review, and a final sign off.\r\n- Pre Startup Safety Reviews are conducted to ensure new and modified equipment is ready and safe for start-up. The Pre Start up Safety Review confirms construction and equipment is designed in accordance with specifications, safety, operating and maintenance procedures are in place and adequate, a process hazard analysis was performed and recommendations were resolved before startup and training was conducted.\r\n- Hot Work permits are issued for hot work operations conducted on or near ammonia refrigeration system. The permits documents that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the initiation of hot work operations.\r\n- A team of associates investigates every incident that results in or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release.
