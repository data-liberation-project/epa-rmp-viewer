Management and employees make safe operations and accident prevention the way of doing business everyday.  For example, process safety information is discussed routinely.  Written follow-up reports from these meetings help to ensure on-going safety.  A process hazard analysis has been conducted for this process and findings have been documented, reviewed, and where needed, acted upon to ensure that procedures or design systems are modified to maintain a safe operation.  New operators will be trained on the operating procedures, health and safety issues, emergency operations, and applicable safe work practices. In addition to operator training, all personnel at KU have been involved in awareness training, which reinforces the importance of safety at this facility.  The engineering firm designing this system has provided manufacturer information which, when entered into KU?s computerized maintenance management program, allows for tracking and accountability.  This program ensures that on-going preventive maintenance issues are addressed before an occurrence.  A management of change procedure, which prevents substitution of parts, is part of prevention.  All employees are aware of the hazards when substituting parts of the wrong specification, which can lead to a serious ammonia release.  Compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted as required.  Employees are encouraged to participate in the safety process, which includes process reviews, training, and procedure writing.  Contractors are selected based on previous safety performance and practices. In summary, the E.W. Brown Station and its employees are committed to a safe operation of their facility to prevent the release of ammonia that could endanger personnel, public, and the environment.",

      "SummaryText": "E.W. Brown Generation Station, Kentucky Utilities, Mercer County, Kentucky, operates an inlet cooling system.  This system uses approximately 32,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two separate ice thermal storage tanks.  Engineers and company officials have reviewed relevant data from other existing systems to assist them with engineering design and mitigation techniques.  This process is required to comply with 40 CFR part 68, Clean Air Act Amendments, Risk Management Plan.  KU has developed a Risk Management and Process Safety Management Program to inform employees and management of the required procedures to maintain a safe operation.\n\nThis system is a closed-loop system with automatic shutdown activation.  KU has trained process operators and emergency response team members should an emergency occur. Procedures that are in place to assist with quick mitigation of this type of release include: two operators performing this function so that if release occurs, isolation upstream can occur; radio communication to the control panel operator; trained emergency response personnel; and control panel operators recognizing a change in pressure. This process is also designed with an automatic shutdown system.  Control panels will be monitored by trained personnel aiding in a quick response.  Equipment used to process, store, and handle ammonia are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases.  \n\nKU's computerized maintenance management system enables personnel to provide continuous maintenance.  The maintenance system is computerized and encompasses all phases of maintenance management including problem reporting, resource scheduling, generation of preventative maintenance work orders, equipment database and complete equipment history.  Safe operation of the system is a common goal for all E. W. Brown employees.  This effort is supported through programs described previously and the involvement of plant management in development and imp"
