      "SummaryText": "Spontex Inc. is a sponge manufacturing operation located near Columbia, Tennessee in Maury County.  Spontex utilizes carbon disulfide (CS2) as a process chemical in a viscose production process.  CS2 is shipped to Columbia, Tennessee by way of railcars.  Sponex utilizes nitrogen to displace the CS2 and unload it from a railcar to two 10,500-gallon capacity storage tanks.  These storage tanks are located within a secondary containment dike filled with water, acting as a moat.  From the holding tanks, CS2 is pumped to a 55-gallon \"measuring pot\" on an as needed basis, and then gravity fed to the viscose process.  Spontex is considered a Program 3 facility for the purposes of RMP requirements and is subject to PSM Standards.  As a Program 3 facility, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled,  using the EPA RMP*COMP? program, and the impact information from each scenario is included within the RMP*Submit database.  Spontex is in compliance with the OSHAPSM and EPA RMP rules.  Key components to the prevention program are: high level training for plant operators, preventative maintenance program, technological process and safety equipment, effective operating procedures, performance of hazard review, and frequent inspection programs.  There have been no accidental releases from the facility in the last five (5) years.  The facility has an internal emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the fire and police departments of Maury County.  The program includes an emergency notification plan and names the facility official that will be the incident commander.  Emergency response drills and evacuation drills are conducted every year followed by a critique of all involved.  Planned changes to improve safety include keeping the PSM team active and conduting a HAZOP analysis when processes or equipment is changed."
