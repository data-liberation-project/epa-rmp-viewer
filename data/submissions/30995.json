(hereafter referred to as Columbia Fruit) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Columbia Fruit to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nColumbia Fruit?s emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees. Columbia Fruit has trained its refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\nAt Columbia Fruit, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\n* Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nColumbia Fruit is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 2575 Euclid Ave., Wenatchee, WA.  The facility is located in Chelan County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Columbia Fruit is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nColumbia Fruit uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  Columbia Fruit has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n \n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nColumbia Fruit?s accide"

      "SummaryText": "ntal release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n* High level of training of personnel\n* Preventative maintenance program\n* Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n* Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nColumbia Fruit also complies with: \n* OSHA?s and Washington State?s process safety management rule.\n* Applicable Washington State?s safety regulations (WAC?s 296-24 and 296-62).\n* IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n* Applicable local fire code for handling of hazardous materials.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to applicable codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Columbia Fruit utilizes include:\n* Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n* Suction trap hi-level float\n* High discharge pressure shut down\n* Low suction pressure shut down\n* High discharge temperature shut down\n* Oil pressure failure shut down\n* High amperes shut down\n* Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n* Oil filters plugged shut down\n* 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n* 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n* Emergency ventilation\nOperating Procedures have been prepared by Columbia Fruit to be used by employees performing operational functions.  The operating procedures are kept in the engine room.  These procedures include: \n* Pre-start up procedures\n* Routine operations\n* Maintenance\n* Response to minor releases\n* Emergency action plan\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nColumbia Fruit has not had any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Columbia Fruit has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases invol"
