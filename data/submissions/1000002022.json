      "SummaryText": "International Paper owns and operates a pulp and paper mill and cogeneration plant in Albany, Oregon. The mill facility has a stringent chemical management process. It is the mill standard that every purchased, used or manufactured chemical product and material which are required by law to have Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must: (1) Use the company standard software to manage MSDS for chemicals and chemical materials used in the workplace; (2) Implement site-specific chemical approval and receiving processes; (3) Document the function, use and safe handling procedures of all approved chemicals on site; (4) Maintain a formal procedure for receiving chemicals on-site; (5) Maintain records of chemical use, disposal, employee training and health risk exposure assessments; (6) Adhere to the Company No New Purchases and Restricted Use Only guidelines for chemicals and chemical materials.\n\nThe mill handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). The anhydrous ammonia is used at the mill cogeneration plant as part of the selective catalytic reduction system that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the plant.  The mill also complies with the OSHA PSM rule as it relates to anhydrous ammonia. The mill has experienced no reportable incidents in the last five years involving the anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe mill maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Committee for anhydrous ammonia. This committee reviews possible risks associated with the anhydrous ammonia system storage, handling and use and addresses them. The PSM Committee also reviews incident investigations and follows up on identified corrective actions. Any change to the anhydrous ammonia system must go through both the mill's rigorous Management of Change (MOC) process and a review by the PSM committee. Periodic audits are performed to verify compliance with OSHA and ODEQ requirements. \n\nSystem equipment is periodically inspected"

      "SummaryText": " to assure integrity and proper operation.  Excess flow valves are located on the storage tank to stop ammonia flow and minimize a release if piping is broken. Manual shut-off is in place for timely response if a line rupture occurs during unloading. \n\n Area monitors are located around the perimeter of the anhydrous ammonia storage to detect a release and initiate timely and appropriate response. The monitoring system in use can detect even very small leaks. An onsite Emergency Response Team, which is trained to respond to a variety of environmental-,  safety-, and health-related incidents, has developed an ammonia release response procedure and performs practice drills regularly.  \n\nThe mill is also a founding member of the newly formed Mid-Valley Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The LEPC's responsibility is to organize emergency planning and response in the community. Mid-Valley LEPC is in the process of scheduling assessments for each member facility's emergency response plan to assure coordination within the group and the community in the event of a release or other emergency.\n\nThe International Paper Albany Mill continues to investigate feasible alternatives to the use of anhydrous ammonia.  To date we have not found one that addresses all safety, environmental and operational needs and lessens overall risks. We are committed to minimizing any community impact by operating in a safe and responsible manner.\n"
