      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Dune Company of Roll, Arizona accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  The Dune Company emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Dune Company of Roll, Arizona is a retailer of anhydrous ammonia for agricultural purposes.  This facility serves the local area farmers with ammonia for purposes of facilitating crop growth.  The facility contains anhydrous ammonia in one storage tank located along the southern portion of the facility.  The storage vessel, piping, pumps, and various other equipment are interconnected within the storage area.  The storage vessel capacity at the facility is 30,000-gallons.  The station is usually unmanned unless utilized.  Yardsmen visit the station daily and respond to any problems and alarms as they may occur.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by the EPA of 0.14 mg/L, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maxim"

      "SummaryText": "um airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario at The Dune Company of Roll, Arizona involves a failure of the lines and all mitigation systems within the station between the tank.  Because all the tank, pipes, pump, and equipment are interconnected, the total amount of ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 170,000 lbs.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n\u0015\tOnly the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of a release point is potentially affected.  This plume is, or footprint, approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle.\n\n\u0015\tIt is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one hour average standard.  The one hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten minute release time.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 7.4 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 1,000 was obtained, as a result of the entire city of Roll, Tacna, and surrounding area was encompassed.\n\nT"
