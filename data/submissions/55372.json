Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \n\nA unique liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) process for manufacturing boric acid has been operated at the Facility since 1962.  An organic extractant was developed and patented for use in this process.  The boric acid process is based on the ability of the organic extractant to form a compound with certain boron compounds found in the Searles Lake brines to form a compound that has very specific properties.  \n\nBoric acid production consists of 2 processes: liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) and evaporation-crystallization.  The liquid-liquid extraction process consists of 2 sections:\n1.\tA loading section where boron, sodium and potassium are extracted from the lake brine, and combined into the organic extractant used in the LLX Plant. \n2.\tA stripping section where the boron, sodium and potassium are stripped from the organic extractant by contact with a dilute acidic aqueous solution to form an aqueous solution of boric acid and sodium and potassium sulfates (called the strip solution), and to regenerate the extractant for re-contact with Lake Brine.\n\nIn the evaporation-crystallization section the dilute aqueous strip solution is evaporated and the boric acid is separated from the mixed sulfates by fractional crystallization.\n\nDescription of Regulated Substance Use\nThe extractant is produced at the Facility by mixing a manufactured product (called P20) with kerosene in predetermined volumes according to specific procedures.  P20 is produced in the P20 Plant (at the Trona Facility) and it can be described as a 50% weight solution of specific phenolic compounds in a kerosene base.  The purpose of P20 is to provide the raw material for making the extractant utilized at the LLX plan"

As such, two extensive and detailed emergency response plans have been developed and implemented at the Trona Facility.  These Plans include ALL aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and notification of LERC/LEPD and the Public.\n\nALL emergency response equipment is frequently tested, inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning.  The emergency evacuation sirens are tested every Friday at noon.  In addition, the emergency response plans are reviewed periodically and updated (as needed) to reflect pertinent changes in processes, operations and/or personnel that may require a modified emergency response.  Emergency response drills and exercises are conducted periodically to ensure rapid response and effectiveness of the emergency response team.  ALL employees and contractors are trained in the requirements of these emergency response plans.\n\nIn the unlikely event that a release does occur, Searles Valley Minerals environmental, health and safety (EHS) staff and HazWOper trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.
