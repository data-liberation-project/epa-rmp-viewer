Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Oran Ag Service are committed to the\n     prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.      \n     If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\n     department, Fayette County LEPC, and or other authorities,  to mitigate and minimize the                           impacts of releases  to\n     the people and the environment.  \n     \n     2.   Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct\n     application as a nutrient for crop production.\n     \n    The maximum quantity of Anhydrous ammonia stored would be 99,000 pounds in storage and nurse        tanks. \n     \n     \n3.   Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.   The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n          tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released\n          would be 54,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank\n          at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end\n          point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .7  miles.  \n\n          b.   The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n          likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance\n          to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.  \n     \n4.   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety\n     Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published"

(ANSI), and the standards of the U.S.\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\n     handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by\n     Iowa Administrative Code Part 21 Chapter 43 Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage\n     and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the\n     Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n     \n5.   Five-Year Accident History.        \n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five\n     years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;\n     nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\n     place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n          a.   a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n          b.   provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\n          right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n     \n7.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\n     performed to assess the conditions of Oran Ag Services facility.  \n     \n     There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of\n     anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
