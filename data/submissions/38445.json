      "SummaryText": "FirstEnergy Generation Corporation (FGCO) operates a 2,340 MW (NDC) coal-fired electrical generating plant, known as the Bruce Mansfield Plant, in Shippingport, PA.  Federal and Pennsylvania environmental regulations require coal-burning utilities to reduce emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (Nox).  Part of the Nox control and reduction strategy at the Bruce Mansfield Plant is the installation of Selected Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology.  SCR reduces Nox emissions by reacting flue gas containing Nox  with ammonia to form nitrogen and water.  The SCR system at the Bruce Mansfield Plant uses aqueous ammonia mixed with air injected into flue gas after the economizer in Units 1, 2 and 3.  The system will operate on Units 1 and 2 during the ozone season of May 1 through September 30 beginning in 2003. It is anticipated that the system will operate during the ozone season each year thereafter. The Unit 3 system is forecasted to commence operation in 2004.\n\nEPA's RMP threshold for coverage under the rule is any process with aqueous ammonia of 20% concentration in quantities over 20,000 pounds. OSHA's PSM threshold for coverage is any process with aqueous ammonia of 44% concentration in quantities over 15,000 pounds.  The covered process as described in this RMP exceeds EPA RMP thresholds but not the OSHA PSM concentration threshold.  Therefore, only RMP requirements apply at this time.\n\nThe covered process includes all areas in the SCR system where aqueous ammonia exists in concentrations above the RMP threshold of 20%.  This includes the railcar unloading operations, storage tanks and transfer lines up to the point of vaporization and injection, where the concentration falls below the concentration threshold as it is atomized into a gaseous spray (approximately 3% concentration by volume).  Covered activities related to this process include the use, operation, repair, replacement and maintenance of equipment in the process.  All personnel involved in these activities are p"

      "SummaryText": "roperly trained in normal and emergency or upset operations.\n\nAs defined by the rule, the worst case release is the failure of one of the storage tanks inside the storage tank containment area.  The spill of 29% aqueous ammonia would flow along the sloped floor towards a centerline sump.  The sump has pre-cast concrete covers with 3 inch diameter holes to allow drainage but restrict evaporation.  According to engineering calculations, a spill this large would drain through the covers in about 8.5 minutes.  Employing this passive mitigation results in a worst-case scenario with a distance to endpoint that does not impact public or environmental receptors offsite based on analytical methods provided by EPA.\n\nSeveral alternate case scenarios, which may be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario described above, were examined to assess their potential to impact public receptors as well.  The first scenario examined was that of a tank car spill resulting from the failure of a four inch diameter line at the bottom of the car allowing discharge of the entire railcar into the containment sump below.  The sumps in the railcar unloading area are also equipped with pre-cast concrete covers that allow drainage but restrict evaporation.  Based on similar calculations for drainage through the three inch diameter holes in the pre-cast covers, the railcar would nearly instantly drain into the sump and evaporation would be negligible.\n\nAnother scenario examined was that of a pipe failure downstream of the railcar unloading pumps while the pumps were running, allowing aqueous ammonia to discharge onto the ground for about 10 minutes until the condition is identified and the pumps shut down.  Utilizing analytical methods provided by EPA results in a distance to endpoint that does not impact public or environmental receptors offsite.  Therefore neither of these alternate case scenarios has the potential to impact public receptors.\n\nAs this is a new process, there have been no"

In considering the potential to impact public receptors, the concentrations and quantities handled on site, and having no record of accidents, FGCO is registering this process at the Bruce Mansfield Plant under the RMP Program as a Program 2 process.  A Program 2 Accident Prevention Program has been developed and implemented at the Plant.\n\nThe Program 2 Prevention Program implemented addresses required elements of Accident Prevention Planning including: the compilation of and access to process safety information regarding aqueous ammonia and the technologies and equipment used to handle and use it; the conduct of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and implementation of recommendations during the design and implementation of the SCR system; development and implementation of operating and maintenance procedures for safe handling during startup, shutdown and normal, temporary and emergency operations; general training on the system and hazards of aqueous ammonia for all employees and specific training for those involved in the operation and maintenance of the SCR process; a maintenance program with elements to manage mechanical integrity, manage changes and review safety after maintenance operations; conduct of periodic audits of the entire program; and continued implementation of accident and spill incident investigation programs at the Plant. \n\nEmergency Response planning has long been an integral part of operations at the Bruce Mansfield Plant.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard and PADEP have required the plant to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters and storms, exposure to releases of hazardous chemicals or harm and damage due to flammable or explosive materials.  These procedures have been documented in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe RMP Regulations require that the plant have a written plan of action for emergencies tha"
