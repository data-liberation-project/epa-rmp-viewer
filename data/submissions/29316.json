The natural gasoline used by Nebraska Energy LLC to denature alcohol contains the following flammable regulated substances:\n\nIsopentane                Pentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at Nebraska Energy LLC is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving 229,529 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in a single storage tank.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a low population area, the WCS could not affect nearby residential public receptors, but may affect adjacent commercial or industrial public receptors.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.2 miles.  Credit for passive mitigation measures was taken for the dike surrounding the single storage tank during the evaluation of this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at Nebraska Energy LLC is a liquid pool fire resulting from the release of a flammable mixture from over filling the single storage tank (43,576 pounds released in 26 minutes). The release is expected to be isolated by plant operations personnel within 10 minutes. Since this facility is located in a low population area, the WCS could not affect nearby residential public receptors, but may affect adjacent commercial or industrial public receptors. The maximum distance to the heat radiation endpoint (5 kilowatts / square meter) for this WCS is 0.1 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and action.\n\nNebraska Energy LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \nThe "

Because a process at the facility that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n \nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n \nInvolvement and participation by all employees and their representatives is an important aspect of Nebraska Energy?s PSM / RMP program.  Nebraska Energy LLC employee involvement in the PSM / RMP programs will ensure that all perspectives are considered and that the best ideas are implemented. In addition, all Nebraska Energy LLC employees have the right, and the responsibility, to participate in the development of PSM activities.\n\nNebraska Energy LLC will actively seek employee involvement through these basic approaches:\n\n? By integrating PSM requirements into normal work activities;\n? Through participation by interested employees on a voluntary basis;\n? Through active consultation with all affected employees and their representatives;\n? By addressing anonymous communication to any supervisor pertaining to any element of the PSM program;\n? Through participation as subject matter experts in the development of operating procedures and training;\n? Through participation on the PSM Committee;\n? Participation in MOC meetings; and\n? Participation in PHA studies.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n \nNebraska Energy LLC has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes.  The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.

Nebraska Energy LLC requires that each employee presently involved in operating a process or a newly assigned process must be trained in an overview of the process and in its operating procedures.  This training is done on initial hiring, when there are any changes in Nebraska Energy LLC operations and at least every three (3) years.  Nebraska Energy LLC training includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards of the process, emergency operations including shutdown, and other safe work practices that apply to the employee's job tasks.\n\nNebraska Energy LLC has clearly identified the employees to be trained, the subjects to be covered, and the goals and objectives to be achieved.  Nebraska Energy LLC has identified the important actions and conditions under which the employees will demonstrate competence or knowledge as well as what is acceptable performance.  Hands on training also enhances learning by teaching Nebraska Energy LLC employees under controlled conditions the correct operating procedures.\n\nNebraska Energy LLC periodically evaluates training programs to see if the necessary skills, knowledge, and routines are being properly understood and implemented by their trained employees.\n \nCONTRACTORS\n \nNebraska Energy LLC uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of \nadditional maintenance or construction activities.

Nebraska Energy LLC Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR?s)\n \nNebraska Energy LLC requires a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) to be performed and documented for any physical modification in the PSM covered processes.  Additionally, any new units added at Nebraska Energy LLC which are considered PSM covered processes will also require a PSSR to be performed and documented.\n\nPrior to the introduction of a highly hazardous chemical into a Nebraska Energy LLC PSM covered process, a pre startup safety review must confirm the following:\n? Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n? Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\n?

The MOC process also requires that equipment records, process safety information, operator training, and operating procedures are updated when changes in the process occur.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n \nNebraska Energy requires any incidents that resulted in a release of a highly hazardous chemical, or near misses, must be investigated.  The incident investigation will be started as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  A team consisting of at least one person knowledgeable in the process will investigate the incident. The Process Incident Investigation Teams gather, examine, and report the facts pertaining to each process incident.  Nebraska Energy LLC has established a system to promptly address and resolve the reported incident investigation findings and recommendations.
