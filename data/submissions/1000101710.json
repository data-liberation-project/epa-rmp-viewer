(Reser\u0092s Capitol) industrial food manufacturing facility uses pure anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Given the quantity managed, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA. Anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee, public health and safety during an unplanned event.  It is a Reser\u0092s Capitol policy to remain in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n1.1.2.\tSafety is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is managed. The design of the facility incorporates an array of safety devices and safe handling procedures combined with training of our personnel, are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n1.1.3.\tReser\u0092s Capitol has a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations. Reser\u0092s Capitol is not equipped to perform offensively during an unplanned event. An Emergency Action Plan was developed in accordance with the Emergency Response provisions and includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside agencies. This enables Reser\u0092s Capitol personnel and outside agencies to have a coordinated course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.2.\tFacility Description And Substances Managed\n\n1.2.1.\tReser\u0092s Capitol is a food manufacturing facility that warehouses and distributes refrigerated foods. Refrigeration is a required process to preserve the integrity of processed foods. This refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees only. Unauthorized personnel, visitors and contractors shall be accompanied by trained and authorized personnel of the refrigeration team.\n\n1.2.2.\tThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.3.\tThe amm"

There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n1.3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n1.3.1.\tRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the Marplot Map Server.  This system was used to estimate the residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  \n\n1.3.2.\tWorst-Case Scenario. Catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver located in the compressor room when filled to the greatest amount (80%) would release 33,080 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario presumes that the entire contents are released. \n\n1.3.3.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.6 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 3,820.  \n\n1.3.4.\tThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g., earthquake) by physically compromising the vessel. The structural integrity of the vessel is safeguarded by periodic inspection for mechanical integrity to prevent a rupture due to vessel degradation. The vessel is also safeguarded from rupture from over-pressurization.  It is a ASME rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 325 psi and equipped with 250 psi pressure relief valves. The design specification of the vessel only allows for MAWP ( maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psi @ 200?F and a maximum capacity of 80% at 650?F, limiting the total amount of ammonia in the system.  During high demand, the High Pressure Receiver may only be filled to a fraction (~20%) of capacity.  In addit"

The worst case weather scenarios are uncommon.  \n\n1.4.\tAlternative Scenario. \n\n1.4.1.\tSeveral alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1\u0094 opening in a high pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 18,080 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would result in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\n\n1.4.2.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.6 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 6 with the closest residence and schools inside the release zone. \n \n1.4.3.\tThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves.  In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly and effectively reducing the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\n1.5.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n1.5.1.\tReser\u0092s Capitol complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
