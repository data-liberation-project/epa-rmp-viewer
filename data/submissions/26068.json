The facility encourages active participation of personnel in prevention program activities at the plant.

SCDPP sells base chemicals to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products ranging from plastics to building materials.  About 750 full-time employees work at the site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSCDPP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for our workers, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations.  As part of this commitment, SCDPP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the site.  The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Shell Chemical Deer Park Plant.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the SCDPP consists of the following three elements:\n \n\u00b7  A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and to (b) provide information to the public regarding accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n\n\u00b7  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate th"

In fact, SCDPP has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nSCDPP policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance needs to be used, plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nSCDPP strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.

In the event of an accidental release, plant operators and emergency responders work together closely to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled at SCDPP.  In addition, SCDPP has a leadership role in Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  This is a state chartered non-profit mutual-aid cooperative combining the fire fighting, rescue, hazardous material handling and emergency medical capabilities to its members in the Houston Ship Channel area. Along with the CIMA organization, the plant takes an active role in the local emergency planning committee for Deer Park.

The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA standard for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview\u00ae III program was utilized to estimate the number of persons living within this distance from the location of the potential release point.

This flammable substance release scenario assumes the entire contents of the tank is released and vaporizes to form a vapor cloud that subsequently ignites.  In this scenario, a pressure of 1-psi over normal atmospheric pressure is used as the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion.  No credit is taken for active or passive mitigation. Under the EPA defined worst weather conditions, the 1,3-pentadiene explosion could potentially travel 1.7 miles before the pressure diminished below the 1-psi endpoint. Potential public receptors include schools, residences, and industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nAn \u00bfalternate release scenario\u00bf for 1,3-pentadiene involves the failure of a gasket in a tank truck loading line.  For this scenario, the gasket failure causes the leak of 1,3-pentadiene which flashes/pools, and is ignited, resulting in a pool fire.

PHAs are revalidated at least every five years by a team made up of individuals with engineering, and process operating experience.  One member of the team is knowledgeable in PHA methodology and serves to facilitate the PHA.  Potential hazards identified during the PHA are risk-ranked to ensure that highest priority is given to those having the highest consequence and likelihood of occurrence. After management review of the identified potential hazards and confirmation of proposed considerations, a written PHA report is prepared describing the results of the analysis.  Approved considerations are assigned and tracked to completion using a Mitigation Tracking System.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures have been developed for each process area. Operating procedures are reviewed annually by unit operators and engineers and certified as being correct.
