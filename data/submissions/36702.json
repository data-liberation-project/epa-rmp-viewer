The Facility Policy\n\nHoward County Equity Co-op Association is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 122,000 pounds in one 18,000 gallon storage tank and associated nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tanktruck holding 40,000 pounds. \n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nNot listed.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of EPA 40 CFR part 68 \"Accidental Release Prevention,\" ANSI K61.1 ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\" OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,? and Iowa State Fertilizer laws.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.
