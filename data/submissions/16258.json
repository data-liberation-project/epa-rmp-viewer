By training personnel and using safe operating procedures the chances of an accident are reduced.  Also, it is facility policy to adhere to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.\n\nIf an accident should occur, emergency response would be provided by, and has been coordinated with, the local fire authority.\n\nFacility Information\n\nThis facility stores fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity handled, in a 30,000 gallon tank, is 131,325 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank, released as a gas, within 10 minutes.  The quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which is the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would be 1.07 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario, a more likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point would be  .41 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nThis facility adheres to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", K61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThis facility, rather than using its own personnel, relies on, and has coordinated with, the local fire authority for emergency response to any accidental release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPeriodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance "
