The Keokuk facility is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals. \n\n\n\n<> The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nRAI has four covered processes at the Keokuk facility. Three of the processes contain anhydrous ammonia above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The fourth process is a hydrogen production and storage system. RAI owns, operates, and controls hydrogen production, handling and storage equipment that is interconnected with a hydrogen storage system owned, operated, and controlled by Praxair, Inc. (Praxair). More specifically, Praxair's storage system is located on the RAI site and is inside a fenced area. Piping from Praxair's hydrogen storage system passes across a chain link fence and into RAI's process.  \n\n\n\n<> The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nRAI is responsible for all components of the anhydrous ammonia covered processes. RAI is also responsible for all components of the hydrogen covered process that are outside of the Praxair compound. Praxair is responsible to RAI for all components of the covered process inside the Praxair compound. The Keokuk facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations. The required elements "

RAI's Emergency Response Team (ERT) receives HAZWOPER training and responses to chemical releases. The emergency response program has been developed in cooperation and with support of the Keokuk Fire Department.
