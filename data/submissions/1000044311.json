It is the stated policy of SABIC to safely manage our site operations. In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur. \n\nThe efforts at our facility have been recognized by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which oversees our programs, as among the best in the nation for worker safety. \n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility. If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Human Resources Department at (815) 433-7427. \n\n \n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority. This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities. \n\nIn order to provide top-quality products for our customers, the Ottawa facility uses in its manufacturing process some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. We are committed to complying with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as conducting systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation. Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical. However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response organization will be activated"

      "SummaryText": ". This organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical, rescue and chemical emergency response teams.\n\nThe outstanding safety programs at the Ottawa facility have earned the site OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR status, presented by OSHA for exemplary safety management. This is OSHA's highest recognition for safety performance. Because of this exemplary performance, the OSHA Training Institute has chosen to use the Ottawa plant site eight times for Process Safety Management (PSM) training.\n\n\n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe SABIC plant is located on a 215-acre tract along the Illinois River about three miles east of Ottawa, IL. It was built in 1967 and currently employs about 243 people in the Illinois River Valley. The plant manufactures engineered thermoplastic resins and pellets. Our products are used in the automotive, medical, electronics, computer, and appliance industries, to name a few. \n\nIn order to ensure quality products, quality service and quality of life, the SABIC has invested more than $20 million since June 2009 for expansion, capital improvement, and safety and environmental protection.\n\nThe Ottawa, IL plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule: acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance, and 1,3-butadiene, a regulated flammable substance. Acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene are raw materials used to manufacture our products. \n\n \n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSABIC has implemented a comprehensive PSM program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals. PSM is an integral part of working safely at SABIC facilities. PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and, critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention"

Under this process, the amount of butadiene is controlled such that if a problem were to be detected that required the process to be shut down, the chemical reaction would immediately cease before an unsafe condition could develop;\n\n- A computer-controlled Safety Instrumented System (SIS) on the latex manufacturing process to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n\n- Backup cooling water systems in the plastic resin manufacturing processes that can be activated both automatically and manually;\n\n- Backup shutdown systems for the plastic resin manufacturing processes;\n\n- Extensive safety information about the processes reviewed with employees and contractors;\n\n- A comprehensive reliability review program for all "

Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.\n\nEPA requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impact be reported in this document.

All of our employees are trained in the proper response to an incident. We also invest in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site.

Training is conducted at the site on the Ottawa Site Emergency Response Plan, firefighting methods and operations, hazardous material response, and advanced rope rescue.\n\nEmergency medical response is a part of the Ottawa Site ERT system. These personnel have been trained by the Ottawa Site Nurse under the direction and requirements of the OSF St. Elizabeth Hospital Emergency Room Staff and Ottawa Fire Department personnel to respond to potential medical emergency conditions at the Emergency Medical System - First Responder level. An ongoing training program has been in place for these personnel for the last eight years. In order to ensure prompt medical attention for serious conditions, the Ottawa Site has coordinated with Life Flight medical helicopter support centers (St. Francis-Peoria and Loyola-Chicago).\n\nThe Ottawa Site ERT has a Mutual Aid Agreement with the Marseilles Area Fire Protection District. Since the beginning of this relationship, SABIC, the District, and the Ottawa Fire Department have conducted joint training to further develop emergency response skills.
