This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of T E Products Pipeline Company, LP (TEPPCO) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal located in Schuyler County, New York is owned by T E Products Pipeline Company, LP and is operated by TEPPCO.  \n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from a T E Products Pipeline underground pipeline and is stored in either of two above ground 30,000 gallon nominal capacity storage tanks, or in an uderground storage cavern.  The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tanks or cavern into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  TEPPCO identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane and ethyl mercaptan are the only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Watkins Glen Terminal.  The Terminal is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Mana"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Watkins Glen Terminal.  The processes at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the terminal?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nTEPPCO strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a ?near-miss? reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nTEPPCO actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  TEPPCO keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nTEPPCO also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of TEPPCO staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures pro"

Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Watkins Glen Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the terminal.  New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near the terminal storage and loading equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and "

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Watkins Glen Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  TEPPCO personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as terminal equipment, technology (including terminal operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence "

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TEPPCO periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Watkins Glen Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered operations at the Watkins Glen Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal has safety features to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n\nRelease Detection\n\n?    Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms in the storage and loading areas\n?    Flame detection equipment in the storage and loading areas\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n?    Process relief val"

Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n?    Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, flame retardant coveralls, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Watkins Glen Terminal is coordinated with the Schuyler County Emergency Management Office (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Watkins Gl"

      "SummaryText": "en Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Watkins Glen Terminal conducts periodic site orientations and emergency response briefings for emergency response organizations.  The Watkins Glen Terminal also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Watkins Glen Terminal resolves all findings from PHA?s, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are judged to be effective in improving terminal safety or reducing accident risk.  At the present time, there are no projects planned for installation for the purpose of improving safety."
