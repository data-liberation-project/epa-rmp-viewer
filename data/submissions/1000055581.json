Each employee receives annual safety training to reinforce the policies and procedures.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, the worst case release scenario was identified as a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one (1) container over a ten (10) minute period.  The results contained herein are based upon the Offsite Consequence Analysis RMP*Comp Version 1.07.  \n\n\n\nThe WVWA is proud that there have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas for more than ten years.  In the case of an accidental release, personnel have been trained, public notification systems are in place, and response actions have been coordinated with local emergency responders to minimize the potential effects of such an occurrence."
