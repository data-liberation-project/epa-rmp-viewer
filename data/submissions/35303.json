Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and Local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with it's Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\n Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 149,280 pounds stored in one 30,000-storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tanks is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.                                                                                                                \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario: Farmers Union Oil Company has considered the worst possible release and discussed with local emergency personnel the procedures which would be followed in such a case.                          \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility complies with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and Local codes and regulations\n\nThe Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that: Have caused any deaths, injuries, of significant prop"
