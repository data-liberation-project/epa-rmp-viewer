      "SummaryText": "FORT DETRICK RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nExecutive Summary\n21 June 2004\n\nFort Detrick is an active U.S. Army installation located in Frederick County, Maryland.  Situated on 1,143 acres approximately 45 miles west of Baltimore City and 45 miles northwest of Washington, D.C., Fort Detrick is headed by the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM).  Its primary missions are biomedical research and development, medical logistics and materiel management, and global Department of Defense (DOD) telecommunications.  Approximately 6000 full time employees work on Fort Detrick.\n\nFort Detrick uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in quantities that require the development of a Risk Management Program according to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Approximately 8 full time employees split their time between the two facilities.  Since the WWTP and WTP are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM), both chlorine storage systems are considered Program Level 3 processes under 40 CFR 68. Chlorine is the only chemical stored at the installation that exceeds threshold quantities of 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  \n\nThe Risk Management Program at Fort Detrick is designed to prevent a catastrophic release of chlorine gas via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical process risk. Key participants in this program include the Fort Detrick Environmental Quality Control Committee (EQCC), Environmental Management Office (EMO), Directorate of Installation Services (DIS), Safety Office, Industrial Hygiene (IH) Office, Emergency Operations Center, Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), Fire and Emergency Services Division, Public Affairs Office (PAO), and the Provost Marshal Office.\n\nThe prevention program for Fort Detrick\u00bfs WTP and WWTP consists of a combination of engineering controls and administrative procedures. For example, v"

      "SummaryText": "acuum regulators are mounted directly on the chlorine tanks to minimize the possibility of a leak in the lines, and chlorine sensors with audible alarms and lights now automatically alert the Fire and Emergency Services Division. All operators have been certified by the Maryland State Board of Waterworks and Waste Systems Operations. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on 2 June 2004 and revealed no additional safety issues to be addressed and only minor corrections to information previously provided in the PHA. All suggestions from the previous PHA have been addressed by Fort Detrick. \n\nFort Detrick has not had any accidents involving chlorine gas with any off-site or on-site impacts in the past five years. Information about the off-site consequence analysis is included in the program elements.\n\nAs part of the Emergency Response Program, Fort Detrick\u00bfs WWTP and WTP operators do not act as first responders in the event of a chlorine release. The Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services Division is fully trained and equipped to handle hazardous material responses, and they have a mutual aid agreement with Frederick County in case assistance is needed. Procedures to notify the public and local agencies have also been developed and are documented in the Fort Detrick Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). The Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services Division conducted a chlorine gas release exercise on 17 December 2002 at the WWTP with after-action reviews (AAR) from participating offices.\n\nChanges at the facility since the previous RMP was submitted in June 1999 include a reduction in chlorine stored at the WWTP and WTP; both plants now store a maximum of 4 one-ton cylinders of chlorine at a time. Also, a new hoist at the WTP takes up less room than the hoist it replaced, so the operators can now change out chlorine cylinders more easily and safely."
