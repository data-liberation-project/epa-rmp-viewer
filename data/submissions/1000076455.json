This RMP encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program.  Accidental release, prevention, and emergency response policies at the Chickasha Water Treatment Plant (WTP) emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe WTP is located in Chickasha, Oklahoma, at or near Latitude N. 35.03.48 and a Longitude W. 97.55.39.  Chlorine is used to disinfect filtered water to make potable water safe for consumption. The WTP treats on average 3 Million Gallons a Day (MGD).  The WTP is designed to treat up to 6MGD.  The WTP will have the maximum of 16,000lbs of chlorine on-site at any one time.  Chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders with 2-cylinders on process and up to 6-cylinders on standby.  Chlorine is drawn from the cylinders in a gaseous state.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine cylinders and feed systems are checked at least twice daily for leaks and feed rates.  The preventative maintenance program has numerous operator and maintenance checks to ensure full and proper operation.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario has been estimated, per EPA guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release quantity, established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine held in a single vessel.  The WTP's worst-case release scenario is 1 Ton (2,000lbs).  In accordance with 40CFR section 68.25, the chlorine gas will be released at a rate of 200lbs per minute and will continue for ten minutes.\n\n\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measures were included for the worst-case release scenario.

The WTP has not has an incident within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\nUSW Utility Group has developed Accidental Release Response and Prevention Programs in the form of a Risk Management Plan, an Emergency Action Plan, training with local Emergency Responders, Operator training, Operator inspections of the chlorine system, and a Preventative Maintenance Program.\n\n\n\nUSW Utility Group will conduct training with local Emergency Responders (Chickasha Fire Department) more frequently. Operators will be trained and drills conducted as per the WTP's RMP. \n\n"
