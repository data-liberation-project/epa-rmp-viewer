The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\n\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccuring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. The Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant has a strict ploicy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.

Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies\n\nWe at the Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Seabrook Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility which is chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/ operational requirements is 4,000 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite cosequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA int the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidence. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic gaseous chlorine release. The scenario involves the release of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The release rate (lbs./min.) is calculated to be 220. A distance to endpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 61,036 within this distance. \n\nToxic Alternative-Case Analyses\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a catastrophic gaseous ch"

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety information\n\nThe Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is daily monitoring and sampling. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures \n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Seabrook Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency s"
