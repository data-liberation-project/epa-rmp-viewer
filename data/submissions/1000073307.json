It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Primary Facility Activities and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Synthetic Resin Manufacturing.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, that being urea-formaldehyde concentrate (UF-85).  UF-85 is used as a reactant in the manufacture of urea formaldehyde (amino) resins.  The maximum inventory of UF-85 at our facility is 132,000 lb (40,000 of that being formaldehyde).  \n\n\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nAllnex maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are HAZOP, What If/Checklist Combined, and Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years or whenever there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, allnex maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operatio"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAllnex has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided routinely as a part of ongoing operations.  Operating procedures are an integral part of batch reaction processing instructions and are modified as needed through technical and engineering review.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAllnex has a written Mechanical Integrity Program and carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at allnex to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at allnex. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operati"

These audits are carried out at least every 5 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAllnex investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAllnex truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Allnex has a written program (Safety, Health, and Environmental Rules) to help manage this activity.  Allnex has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Allnex does not use contractors for normal maintenance activities or for operation of covered RMP processes.\n\n\n\n4.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nAllnex has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

The bulk formaldehyde solution storage tank system has undergone significant safety improvements in the past.  These improvements included an increase in the size of the passive containment system, installation of adequate agitation to insure uniformity of temperature, high and low temperature indicators and alarms, high level alarms, installation of an additional manual shutoff device, and updated operating procedures.  These improvements remain in place.  \n\n"
