The non-integrated mill concentrates on the production of release backing paper and other specialty papers for food packaging and medical applications.  \n\nLakes States, a division of Wausau-Mosinee Paper Corporation, shares the facility with RPC in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.  Lake States is a producer of Torulla yeast.  Following drying and packaging, the yeast is sold.\n\nProcesses conducted at RPC require the use of three regulated toxic substances: chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia, in amounts exceeding the respective threshold quantities.  Chlorine is used at the onsite wastewater treatment plant to disinfect process waters.  The chlorine process is a RMP Program 3 covered process.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at Lake States to make aqueous ammonia which is used as a nutrient in the yeast production process.  The anhydrous ammonia process is a RMP Program 3 covered process.  The aqueous ammonia process is a RMP Program 2 covered process.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nRPC is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with pertinent regulations and good operating practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the water treatment and yeast production processes.  If an accidental release were to occur, RPC has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFor the worst-case release scenario, RPC used the latest available version of USEPA's RMP*Comp software to estimate the distances to the toxic endpoints for two of the three toxic substances stored onsite, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to estimate the distance to the toxic"

      "SummaryText": " endpoint for the aqueous ammonia process.  \n\nFor the worst-case anhydrous ammonia release, the entire contents of the largest anhydrous ammonia-containing vessel (64,000 pounds) were assumed to be released.  The worst-case chlorine release scenario consisted of the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel (2,000 pounds).  The worst-case aqueous ammonia release scenario consisted of the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel (260,000 pounds).\n\nPassive mitigation measures were not included in the anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia worst-case release scenarios since passive mitigation measures are not utilized at the facility.  The chlorine cylinders are contained within a roofed shed (three sides are steel, one side is chain-link fence).  Therefore, passive mitigation measures were considered.  Within RMP*Comp, the chlorine release was modeled in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.\n\nThe distances to the ammonia toxic endpoints for the anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia processes are 2.8 and 1.2 miles, respectively.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.  The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoints is 0.9 miles.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L.  The toxic endpoint for all three covered substances extend offsite.  Since anhydrous ammonia has the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint, it was submitted to the USEPA in the RM Plan as the worst-case release scenario.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, and chlorine were each analyzed for an alternative release scenario.  USEPA's RMP*Comp software was used to estimate the toxic endpoints for the anhydrous ammonia and chlorine alternative release scenarios.  USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to estimate the toxic endpoint for the aqueous ammoina alternative release scenario.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario:\nThe anhydrous ammonia alternativ"

      "SummaryText": "e release scenario consisted of an ammonia truck pulling away from the ammonia tank while still attached to the ammonia tank fill pipe.  This action essentially produces a hole in the liquid space of the tank that is two inches in diameter.  The height of the liquid column above the hole is 7.25 feet.  The release rate of ammonia due to this action is 7,570 lbs/minute as calculated with RMP*Comp.  The distance to the ammonia toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 0.5 miles.  No active or passive mitigation measures were considered.\n\nChlorine Alternative Release Scenario:\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario consisted of a truck backing into the rotameter causing it to break off.  This action essentially causes a release of chlorine from a pipe at a rate of 3,600 pounds per minute as calculated with RMP*Comp.  The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 0.6 miles.  Since the chlorine cylinders are located within a roofed shed, passive mitigation measures were considered.  Within RMP*Comp, the chlorine release was modeled in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.\n\nAqueous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario fo the aqueous ammonia process was the complete break of a 2\" line coming off the bottom of the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The level in the tank was assumed to be at 7 feet and the release duration was assumed to be 10 minutes.  The distance to the ammonia toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles when calculated using the USEPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  \n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn October 2002, RPC performed process hazard analyses for the three covered processes in order to identify potential hazards at the facility.  RPC has several process controls in use such as sight gauges, relief valves, check valves, and response procedures in the event of a release.\n\nRPC has developed a set of operating procedures that are contained within the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Prog"

This includes preventive maintenance and inspection procedures, the frequency of such procedures, inspection responsibility, and guidance doucments for these procedures.\n\nRPC's procedure for Management of Change has been incorporated as part of the PSM/RMP program.  RPC has implemented this procedure to ensure that changes are properly reviewed and that hazards introduced by the implementation of the change are identified and controlled prior to placing the change in operation.\n\nRPC has implemented a pre-startup safety review procedure to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and are operational and that other aspects of the PSM/RMP program are updated and implemented as needed prior to placing the equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance audits are a critical component of the PSM/RMP program and will provide management with information on the success of the program and on areas that need improvement.  Audits are conducted every three years to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP standards are being followed.\n\nRPC has developed an incident investigation procedure for incidents involving covered processes.
