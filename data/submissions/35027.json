No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process(es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMPlan.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true accurate, and complete.\n\nFor all other covered processes, the undersigned also certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the other information submitted in this RMPlan is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nName: Alan Schmitt\nTitle:   Senior Engineer\nDate:  6/15/2004\n\nRMP DATA ELEMENTS\n\nThe following pages present additional information about our risk management program that EPA's RMP rule has asked us to provide.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces products used by the friction materials, and coatings industries using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\n\n1. epichlorohydrin\n2. ethylenediamine\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL"

Trained personnel are stationed at the tank wagon unloading area during all tank wagon unloadings. \n2. Each chemical has a specific procedure for unloading it, with all necessary precautions and safety steps specified.\n3. Epichlorohydrin tank has a high level alarm with pump interlock, and a high/high level alarm.\n4. Ethylenediamine has high and high/high level alarms.\n5. Computer inventory control to maintain tank levels always below maximum capacity.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\nThere were no releases within the last five years of this report submission date.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response Plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency"
