      "SummaryText": "Introduction/Process Description\n\nThis RMP has been prepared by Roquette America, Inc. (RAI) because it owns, operates, and controls hydrogen handling equipment (piping, valves, etc.) that is interconnected with a hydrogen storage system with a capacity greater than 10,000 pounds.   The hydrogen storage system is owned, operated, and controlled by Praxair, Inc. (Praxair) and RAI has no access to the storage system.    More specifically, Praxair's storage system is located on the RAI site and is inside a fenced area to which RAI does not have access.  Piping from the hydrogen storage system passes across the chain link fence and into RAIs process.  \n\nPlant Description\n\nRAI is located at 1550 Northwestern Avenue in Warren Township, Lake County, Gurnee, Illinois. \n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\nProcess hazard assessments were performed on the covered process using a 'HAZOP' type analysis.  The HAZOP analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction\n\nPrevention System\n\nRAI has a Process Safety Management system.  RAI is responsible for all components of the covered process that are outside of the Praxair compound.  Praxair is responsible to RAI for all components of the covered process inside the Praxair compound.  Procedures are in place for operation, maintenance and inspection of the covered process. RAI maintains Operation and Maintenance documents for its applicable equipment and a formal training process for employees and any contractors before being allowed to work on the systems.  The hydrogen system is visually inspected on a periodic basis.  Personnel are trained on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. Several process controls are in use for the hydrogen system including vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment, rupture disks, and excess flow devices.  \n\nChanges have recently been made"

These include improved/upgraded equipment, revised maintenance, revised training, revised operating procedures, new process controls, and the addition of a separate vent stack for hydrogen.  \n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nRAI has its own Emergency Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases, procedures for informing the public and local agencies, and information on emergency health care. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOn October 17, 2010, Praxair had a release that led to a Praxair customer Service Technician being injured.  \n\n"
