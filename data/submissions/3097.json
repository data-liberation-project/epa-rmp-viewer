If an accidental release shold occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment. Th primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and transfered for use as a crop production nutrient. The maximum  quanity handled would be the 114,000  stored in our storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 114,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85  percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.32 miles. The alternative release scenario based on th five-year accident history is a release from an open valve in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .47 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requiments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA , 29CFR  1910.111. In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspect our plants on an annual basis. \n\nThe following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have occured at our facility. 5-30-98 --- One employee was injured when a valve came off at hose-end. The employee was hospitalized one day and fully recovered. Changes were made in our operation including improved equipment, training and maintenance.\n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan and emergency response plan which are required by OSHA. We also report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inve"
