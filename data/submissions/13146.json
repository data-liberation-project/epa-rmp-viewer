The maximum distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles.  Passive mitigation measures were not taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe refinery encourages employees in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameter"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, CITGO Corpus Christi Refinery, West Plant\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe CITGO Corpus Christi Refinery (refinery) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel and specially trained out-side responders will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nCITGO Refining and Chemicals Company L.P. is a refiner, transporter and marketer of transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, refined waxes, asphalt and other industrial products.  CITGO Corpus Christi Refinery supplies high octane gasoline, diesel fuels and petrochemicals.  The refinery consists of two plants, the East Plant at 1801 Nueces Bay Blvd., and the West Plant at 7350 IH37.  The West Plant refinery has several regulated flammable substances, such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, propanes, butanes, pentanes and flammable mixtures. The refinery also uses and/or processes toxic substances, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide, methyl mercaptan, ammonia and chlorine.  Hydrogen sulfide and chlorine are present above threshold quantities.\n\n\nHazard Assessment Results:\n\nThe information provided are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.  It is not a prediction that a worst case release will occur or any indication that such a release will ever occur.  The release scenarios are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community based upon extreme c"

Given the unrealistic guidelines of a worst-case release, more realistic scenarios (alternative release scenarios) were developed to more closely simulate a real world event.  The alternative release scenarios may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.  The potentially affected areas, given the extreme nature of the hypothetical events, are areas that could be exposed at a potentially health-threatening level.  The levels of concern have been developed by the government for each chemical.  The levels that could be harmful vary significantly by chemical.\n\n The worst-case scenario is the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minuets under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The worst-case scenario for toxic substances in the refinery Program Level 3 processes is a catastrophic failure of a chlorine cylinder.  The scenario is an assumed 10-minute release of 2000 pounds of chlorine gas.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario, as per EPA mandate.  This scenario has offsite impact and the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0087 mg/liter) for this scenario is 5.2 miles.  The laws of physical science would not result in a complete release of the chemical as mandated by the EPA and some literature references suggest that the mandated combination of \"F\" stability class and 1.5 m/sec wind speed may not exist and certainly can not exist for more than 12 consecutive hours.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, smaller more realistic release, for chlorine is failure of the discharge line from the chlorine tank, resulting in a release of 1093 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute period.

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0087 mg/liter) for this scenario is 0.7 miles.  A typical Corpus Christi weather condition is used for all alternative release scenarios.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for H2S is failure of the main acid gas line from the Knock Out Drum resulting in a release of 2130 pounds of H2S over a 10 minute period.  The 10-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to respond to the H2S alarms and to stop the release.

This release scenario has impact slightly offsite and the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm (0.042 mg/liter) for this ARS is 0.5 miles.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in the refinery Program Level 3 processes is an assumed vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest vessel containing hydrocarbons, the Coke Drum.  The inventory of 19475 pounds is assumed to be released, completely vaporized, and ignited, resulting in a VCE.  Ten percent of the released quantities are assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, shills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.

In addition, the refinery also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include conducting training, developing written procedures, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is \nsuitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping and equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident of a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program ar"
