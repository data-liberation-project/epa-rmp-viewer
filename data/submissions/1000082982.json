      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nAt the turn of the century, water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States. Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and other water borne diseases occurred. After chlorine's introduction into the public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960. Water borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S. In the U.S., however, water born disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection. Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\n\n\n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free. Historically, it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures. Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\n\n\nThe City of Hollywood has understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility. The City took a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP regulation and submitted the required documentation on or before June 21, 1999.  As of October, 2019 the City of Hollywood continues to maint"

The WWTP uses about 1400 pounds per day of liquid chlorine to disinfect our effluent and process waters on site to make it more palatable to the receiving waters (the Atlantic Ocean) and the plant processes. We store a maximum of 36,000 pounds of chlorine on site. The chlorine is stored as a liquid gas under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE PROCESS AND SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following paragraph provides a brief narrative of the Southern Regional WWTP chlorine system. The system is a pressure/vacuum system that feeds liquid chlorine from one ton containers at about 130 psi, through liquid chlorine piping to chlorine evaporators, where the liquid is vaporized into a gas. The gas is mixed with water in the chlorine injectors to a chlorine solution of about 3500 ppm before being fed to several key feed points throughout the treatment process.\n\n \n\nThe chlorine ton container and the chlorine evaporator, which are under pressure, are the primary components where a liquid chlorine leak is likely to occur. In the unlikely event of a chlorine leak, chlorine leak detectors and sensors located in the container storage room and the chlorine evaporator area will activate an audible alarm horn and flashing amber light beacon that can be heard and seen in most areas of the plant.  In those areas where the horn and beacon are not heard and seen, local alarm horns and beacons have been installed.  Additionally, the plant's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) display the leak detector that has alarmed to alert operations personnel of a possible chlorine leak. The chlori"

      "SummaryText": "ne sensors indicate the concentration of chlorine gas on display panels outside each of the chlorine storage and evaporator areas and the SCADA system.  Chlorine container cylinders, evaporators, chlorinators and piping are located in an enclosed concrete block building with positive air pressure that removes chlorine gas through a scrubber system that neutralizes the chlorine gas.  And each chlorine cylinder feeding chlorine to the evaporators have a halogen automatic shut-off valve that closes and stops chlorine feed from the cylinder when chlorine gas is detected. In the event of chlorine alarm, plant personnel activate the plant's Emergency Response Program (ERP).  To increase integrity and safety of the chlorine equipment, we have maintained and completed annual maintenance on all evaporators, chlorinators, check valves, and metal piping .\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS SAFETY\n\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\n\n\nChlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n\n\n\n?    A five-year accident history\n\n\n\n?    An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\n\n\n\n?    A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e., minimize the potential for a release)\n\n\n\n?    An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled.\n\n\n\n?    An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\n\n\n\nFollowing development of the RMP, the WWTP submitted a Risk Management Plan (Plan) to the EPA in June of 1999. The plan is a summary of the WWTP RMP. The RMP will be updated every five years, or whenever the process changes or a new process is added. The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the "

      "SummaryText": "prevention program element of the EPA RMP. The WWTP RMP meets the requirement of both regulations.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the WWTP RMP.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant has utilized chlorine to disinfect its effluent and non-potable water system since approximately 1974. In the last five years, the facility has had zero (0) accidental releases that required reporting under the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a toxic gas has been defined by the EPA to be an accidental release in which the largest on site vessel containing chlorine releases its contents as a gas over ten minutes. Since the largest container stored at the treatment plant holds 2,000 pounds of chlorine, the worst case release scenario is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over 10 minutes. This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm. It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation. This scenario resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.9 miles. \n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe alternative release is a \"more likely\" incident than the worst-case. The RMP regulation allows the owner to define the alternative release scenario based on historical experience or operations staff knowledge of their system. The alternative release scenario for the WWTP was to assume that the lead washer on a cylinder captive yoke developed a leak. This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm. It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation. This scenario resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThere are always inherent risks associated with handling and using chlorine. These risks include the potential inhalation of chlorine gas if it is acciden"

Trade secrets\n\n\n\nThe following briefly states the benefits of following key prevention program elements: standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity program, employee training, and the process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\nWWTP personnel have developed up-to-date and accurate written standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that operators have clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system. Effective SOPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of this system and in preventing accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment. An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chlorine releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment. The WWTP mechanical integrity program includes maintenance, inspection, and testing procedures and schedules along with maintenance personnel training.\n\n\n\nKnowledgeable, well-trained personnel are essential to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases. The WWTP training program ensures that personnel working on or near the chlorine system are adequately trained in operation and maintenance procedures and the appropriate responses to an accidental chlorine release.\n\n\n\nThe process hazard analysis is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provide"

The detectors will activate audible alarms and amber lights throughout the plant to give warning to plant staff. The enclosed building, automatic shut-off valves on the ton cylinders and the scrubber system will contain and minimize chlorine gas exposure.  The treatment plant emergency response program includes procedures for notifying the local hazardous materials (hazmat) teams of the incident and procedures for evacuating the plant. There are four local hazmat teams in Broward County that can respond to mitigate a chlorine leak. Plant staff has coordinated with the local hazmat team and fire department to ensure they are fully trained and equipped to quickly respond to an incident.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following lists several projects and/or changes to improve safety at the WWTP:\n\n\n\n?
