From the blending silos, the pellets are sent to the Pellet Product Silos for temporary storage.  The PP pellets (L) are then loaded into railcars and sent to customers.\n\nPolypropylene 2\n\nThe Polypropylene II Unit utilizes Chisso/Amoco technology to produce polypropylene resin using propylene supplied from the Olefins Plant.  The Polypropylene II Unit has two independent production lines, Train No. 1 and Train No. 2.  Each production line has an independent Polymerization Area, Extrusion Area and Silo Area.

The powder, mixed with additives and stabilizers, is then injected into the extruder.  The resulting stabilized polyethylene melt is then fed to an underwater pelletizer and cut into small pellets.\n\nHigh Density Polyethylene 2\n\nIn the HDPE II Plant, polymerization occurs in an isobutane slurry using high activity proprietary catalyst in a loop reactor.  The HDPE II Plant has the capability of producing different grades of products for various applications by customers.   The HDPE II Plant is broken down into the following sections: Catalyst Preparation and Activation, Feed Preparation, Polymerization, Gas Recovery, Extrusion / Blending & Storage / Rail Car Loading.\n\nThe polymerization process reaction is continuous and occurs in a slurry phase with isobutane as the carrier solvent.  The slurry is directed to the High Pressure Flash Chamber where gases and light hydrocarbons are volatilized and exit through the top of the chamber.  Ultimately the polymer is cut into pellets and then transferred to blending silos before being loaded for product shipping.\n\n\nLinear Low Density Polyethylene\n\nThe LLDPE Plant is designed to produce Linear Low Density Polyethylene using two parallel reactor lines.  The process employs a gas phase fluidized bed reactor in which ethylene and co-monomers are polymerized using a proprietary catalyst. Ethylene, hydrogen, and a co-monomer are reacted with injected pre-polymer powder in a fluidized bed reactor to produce LLDPE.  This product is continuously withdrawn via a lateral withdrawal system for degassing and downstream process. The virgin powder is received and blended with additives for extrusion and pelletization.

The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction.  The reaction is initiated most commonly with an organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags. \n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene.  Four oxychlorination trains are used to combine ethylene, hydrogen chloride, and oxygen to form ethylene dichloride.  Purified EDC (10) is thermally cracked into VCM and HCl in the EDC Crackers. The VCM produced in the furnaces is purified, washed, dried, and sent to the Polyvinyl Chloride department for conversion to PVC.  HCl (6) is also purified to meet the quality required as the raw material for the oxychlorination section.  EDC is recycled back to the process. \n\nEthylene Glycol\n\nThe Etylene Glycol plant produces monoethylene glycol, diethylene glyco, and triethylene glycol.  The glycols are produced in two major steps.  Oxygen from the Air Separation Plant (ASP) is reacted with ethylene from the Olefins Plant to form ethylene oxide (EO). EO is produced in the Scientific Design liscensed glycol reaction and scrubbing section utilizing Mitisubishi reactors.   This safe process begins with only 10 percent EO in a hydrolysis process to produce EG.  There is no storage of EO on the site.  If the EG unit is not running, the EO unit is shut down.  The glycol is distilled into MEG, DEG, and TEG products.  All process vents, except for the carbon dioxide regeneration vent, are directed to a furnace.\n\n\nMarine Traffic\n\nMarine Traffic is charged with loading liquid products and unloading liquid feedstock to and from ships and barges.  Products are sent from the process units and Inland Traffic by pipeline and tank truck to the Marine Traffic Tank "

At the Marine Facility Dock Area, products are loaded onto barges and ships.  The loading emissions are collected and burned in the Marine Facility Dock loading flare.  The dock flare is designed to handle the vapors generated during the loading of hydrocarbon material.  The marine facility has a vapor collection system to collect the loading emissions and route them to the dock flare.  This system is vapor tight and ensures minimal emissions during loading.\n\n\n\nInland Traffic\n\nInland Traffic is charged with loading liquid products to railcars and trucks.  Caustic is produced by the Ion Exchange Membrane Plant and stored in tanks operated by the Traffic Department.  Ethylene Dichloride (EDC) is stored in tanks prior to being transferred to Marine Traffic or being sent to the Ethylene Glycol Plant.

Before starting the each unit, a process hazard analysis (PHA) as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 was completed. The methodology used was the Hazards and Operability Study.  Since the last PHA study, process parameters have been changed, and additional process controls, process detection systems and mitigation systems have been installed.\n\nDuring the study, the PHA Team evaluated major hazards like, toxic gas release; fire; explosion; runaway reaction; polymerization; overpressurization and overfilling tanks, reactors, etc; equipment failure; and loss of cooling, heating, electricity and instrument air.\n\nBased on the hazards, the Team insured that there were adequate process controls like, vents; relief valves and rupture disks to insure that holding vessels do not fail in case of overfilling or overpressurization; check valves to insure that the chemicals do not flow back into equipment containing incompatible materials; flares in case of gas release; manual/ automatic shutoffs and excess flow device to prevent unwanted discharges; alarms and procedures for the operator to take action in case of a process upset; interlocks to insure that the system shuts down in case of an emergency; emergency air and power supply for equipment to keep functioning until the system can been shut down during utility failure; and process area detectors to warn the unit in advance of the impeding danger of a gas release.In case there was an incident, the Team also evaluated the mitigation systems like sprinkler and water deluge systems to either dilute or keep below the explosion point of a gas release; and dikes to insure that the release does not spread and contaminate the surrounding ground.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n5-year accidental release history: July 2004 through May,2009 was selected for the "
