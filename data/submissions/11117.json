      "SummaryText": "Candle Corporation of America, Inc.'s manufacturing facility produces many types of wax candles.  Candles are manufactured through a variety of process, most all of which utilize process heat.  This heat comes from steam created in the facilities boilers.  One of the fuel source choices for the boilers is propane. A 30,000 gallon aboveground propane bulk storage tank is used to store the facilities propane.  Vaporizers are also used because the surface area of the tank is not sufficient to support the facility in the winter months.\n\nThe facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is Candle Corporations policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify Surry County Emergency Services and request their response.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the propane tank when filled with its maximum contents (88% capacity at 600F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA's RMP*Comp software, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There is one home within this radius, with an maximum estimated population of 5 people.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify Surry County Emergency Services and requests that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  Additionally members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\nAt this time we are confident in our approach to propane safety and have no projected improvements."
