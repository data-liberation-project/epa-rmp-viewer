For example, nearly all municipal and industrial water treatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for water disinfectants and other treatment products, equipment and expertise.\n\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Minneapolis, MN with branches that meet local needs in seven neighboring states.  The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.\n\nHawkins has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan for its Centralia, Illinois, 2 Cahill Drive Facility where its primary activity is to receive and distribute packaged products such as chlorine for use by individual customer facilities.\n\nThe RMP that Hawkins has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool, it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others.  Risk Management Plans (RMPs) are developed by facilities that have sufficient quantities of any 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle only one of the those materials.  In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that 150, 000 RMPs have been submitted since the original June 1999 due date.\n\nThe products covered in our RMP for this facility is chlorine.  Chlorine and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) are well known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, waste water, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc.\n\nRisk Management\nHawkins, Inc. provides products critical to meeting the regions' public health and the manufacturing needs.  Some of these products pose risks, which is why all Hawkins' employees share a comittment to safety.  Our safety policy states \"Hawkins recognizes its obligation to provide all employees with a safe and healthful workplace.  The company has provided and will continue to provide the hum"

Hawkins, Inc. is a leader in national efforts to ensure safe handling of chemicals such as chlorine.\n\nReality is accidents can happen.  To mitigate accidents, Hawkins continually update mechanical safeguards and invest heavily in training for our employees and customers.
