Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nAmericold is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance. This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes. To insure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety their are ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and time sensitive inspections being conducted as required by RMP. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.38)to comply with EPA's  Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68.90-95). \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as prevent fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and avoid physical damage to the environment and property.\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Americold St Paul facility is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of food products.  Product is stored in refrigerated or dry storage warehouse and then distributed by tractor trailer to various customers.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory is based on two separate ammonia systems on this property with a total inventory of approximately 11,000 lbs.  Since ammonia "

Through the use of two stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25F. And +20f.  The  higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nD.

Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program.  Trained employees are available to assist local responders.  This plan is coordinated with the HazMat Team, Station 14 (651-224-7811).\n\n\n\nF.
