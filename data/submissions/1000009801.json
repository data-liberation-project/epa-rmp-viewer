Process Safety Management elements are the core of the prevention program implementation.  \n\nMechanical compression and heat exchange cycles occur within the interconnected piping and equipment.  The elements of process safety management are implemented to assure the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.  A PHA revalidation was conducted on 12/10/2007, in order to identify hazards and address them adequately.  \n\nPrimary safeguards include automated refrigeration controls with redundant safety systems, ammonia detection and machinery room emergency ventilation.   \n\nThe PSM/RMP prevention program is managed by facility staff to assure system equipment safeguards and industry standards are met to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Mechanical Integrity of the process equipment is maintained through inspections, routine testing and appropriate levels of operator training.  Refrigeration system operators and contractors receive training for safe work practices to prevent all releases or stop them small in instance when incidental releases might occur. \n\n",

Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nAmericold is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance. This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes. To insure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety their are ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and time sensitive inspections being conducted as required by RMP. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.38)to comply with EPA's  Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68.90-95). \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as prevent fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and avoid physical damage to the environment and property.\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Americold St Paul facility is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of food products.  Product is stored in refrigerated or dry storage warehouse and then distributed by tractor trailer to various customers.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory is based on two separate ammonia systems on this property with a total inventory of approximately 11,000 lbs.  Since ammonia "
