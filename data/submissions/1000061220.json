Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTherma Tru Corporation (Therma Tru) manufactures steel and fiberglass residential and commercial doors within three (3) on-site production lines, of which an important component is the utilization of foam insulation. The facility operates under the North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 332321 and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 3089 and 3442. Therma Tru uses three (3) different raw materials in the production of foam insulation to fill the doors.  One raw material is Polymeric Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate  (also referred to as \"MDI\", \"Iso\" or \"A Side\"). The second raw material is Polyol, which when blended with the blowing agent, the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture, creates the \"B Side\" blend.  Formulations are highly proprietary and thus confidential.  The \"A-side\" is mixed with the \"B-side\" blend to make foam.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the foam manufacturing process, the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations 40 CFR 68. Therma Tru has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation. Therma Tru also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe cyclopentane/isopentane mixture is delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into an exterior aboveground storage tank using a transfer pump.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of flammable vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. The cyclopentane/isopentane mixture is pumped from the storage tank to the blend room where the material is blended with polyol and then sent to the foam metering equipment within the plant interior, the pressure is increased so it can be injected into products on one of the thre"

Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Therma Tru\n\nTherma Tru is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the site Emergency Action Plan. In addition, Therma Tru complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation. Design criteria established include safety relief valves, fail safe automatic control valves,  nitrogen blanketing, hydrocarbon detection systems, lightning protection, electrical grounding protection, ventilation flow controls, extensive exhaust ventilation design and implementation.\n\n\n\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations, Therma Tru performed the following offsite consequence analyses.\n\n- One worst-case release scenario for the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture.\n\n- One alternate-case release scenario for the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture. \n\n\n\nTherma Tru used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to calculate the estimated release rates and to determine the distance to the appropriate flammable endpoints.\n\n\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  There were no accidental releases that occurred during the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nE.

The PHA was performed using the HAZOP method. The PHA identified the hazards associated with the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture and the covered process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases. Any issues identified during the PHA were documented and resolved in a timely manner.

The safety performance of each contractor is evaluated prior to selection. Each contractor employee is informed of the known potential fire, explosion hazard related to work on a covered process as well as the relevant provisions of the emergency response program. Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency R"

      "SummaryText": "esponse Program\n\nTherma Tru will only respond to incidental releases of the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture, where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases, Therma Tru will rely on outside responders. Therefore, Therma Tru has coordinated response actions with the local fire department and ensured that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response. Therma Tru actively conducts emergency drills on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTherma Tru has a PSM program designed for continuous improvement. If any changes occur in the future which affect the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture processes, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the safety of Therma Tru employees and neighbors are not compromised.\n\n"
