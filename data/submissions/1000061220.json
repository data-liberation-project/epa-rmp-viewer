Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nTherma Tru Corporation (Therma Tru) manufactures steel and fiberglass residential and commercial doors within three (3) on-site production lines, of which an important component is the utilization of foam insulation. The facility operates under the North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 332321 and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 3089 and 3442. Therma Tru uses three (3) different raw materials in the production of foam insulation to fill the doors.  One raw material is Polymeric Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate  (also referred to as MDI, Iso or A Side). The second raw material is Polyol, which when blended with the blowing agent, the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture, creates the B Side blend.  Formulations are highly proprietary and thus confidential.  The A-side is mixed with the B-side blend to make foam.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the foam manufacturing process, the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations 40 CFR 68. Therma Tru has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation. Therma Tru also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe cyclopentane/isopentane mixture is delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into an exterior aboveground storage tank using a transfer pump.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of flammable vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. The cyclopentane/isopentane mixture is pumped from the storage tank to the blend room where the material is blended with polyol and then sent to the foam metering equipment within the plant interior, the pressure is increased so it can be injected into products on one of the thre"

For non-incidental releases, Therma Tru will rely on outside responders. Therefore, Therma Tru has coordinated response actions with the local fire department and ensured that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response. Therma Tru actively conducts emergency drills on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nTherma Tru has a PSM program designed for continuous improvement. If any changes occur in the future which affect the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture processes, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the safety of Therma Tru employees and neighbors are not compromised."

Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Therma Tru\r\nTherma Tru is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the site Emergency Action Plan. In addition, Therma Tru complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation. Design criteria established include safety relief valves, fail safe automatic control valves,  nitrogen blanketing, hydrocarbon detection systems, lightning protection, electrical grounding protection, ventilation flow controls, extensive exhaust ventilation design and implementation.\r\n\r\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\r\n\r\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations, Therma Tru performed the following offsite consequence analyses.\r\n- One worst-case release scenario for the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture.\r\n- One alternate-case release scenario for the cyclopentane/isopentane mixture. \r\n\r\nTherma Tru used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to calculate the estimated release rates and to determine the distance to the appropriate flammable endpoints.\r\n\r\nD.

Maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been implemented to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.75. The MOC procedures do not apply to replacements in kind which are defined as replacements that satisfy the original design specifications (e.g., replace a pressure reducing valve with a new identical valve supplied by the original equipment manufacturer).\r\n\r\nPrior to introducing a change, the MOC procedure is implemented to ensure the following:\r\n- The technical basis for the change and its impact on health and safety has been fully evaluated;\r\n- Affected operating procedures and applicable process safety information have been updated accordingly; and\r\n- The schedule for implementing the change has been developed and required authorizations have been obtained.\r\n\r\nAll employees involved in operating or maintaining the modified process are informed of the change and trained accordingly prior to startup of the modified process.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - PSSRs are performed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.77 for new covered processes and for modified covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The PSSR confirms the following prior to introducing a regulat"
