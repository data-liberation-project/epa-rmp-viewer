Our facility does not retail or wholesale out anhydrous ammonia therefore we do not store or ship this product in nurse tanks.\n \nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tank(s) [2 @ 5,985 gallons in water capacity] on site.  The maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks is 52,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTherefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 52,300 pounds. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 26,150 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO \nTOXICS -  AMMONIA (Anhydrous)\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of one 5,985 gallon storage tank; released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 26,150 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted that Ramsdell F&M, Ltd. has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS \nTOXICS - AMMONIA\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) for ammonia from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a pipe failure requiring a manual shut down should the excess flow valves not engage.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.\n\nThis release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted Ramsdell F&M, Ltd. has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nAMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (2"

      "SummaryText": "9 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  Load out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves.  Hoses have been removed from the risers as our facility no longer distributes anhydrous in nurse tanks. All main storage tank valves and riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release . This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepare"

The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We provide our employees ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all proper safe handling procedures for ammonia. Ammonia equipment is regularly inspected and maintained. The Terra International EHS staff  review and update training and maintenance procedures routinely to ensure our facility meets or exceeds all applicable regulatory requirements and industry standards."
