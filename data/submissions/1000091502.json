      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC is submitting this electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as the initial registration in accordance with the rule.  All accident prevention elements have been developed and reviewed.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Hazardous Material Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Hazardous Material Tanker Truck Staging (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\n\n\n\nThe Facility coordinates delivery of anhydrous ammonia by tanker truck or railcar and hires a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor - IFRC) to transfer and blend anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid and water to make ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer.  The APP liquid fertilizer is blended in a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by the Contractor.  The APP liquid fertilizer is not subject to the PSM/RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe tanker truck Transport Owner/Operator is responsible for: transporting anhydrous ammonia to the Facility; staging the tanker truck at the Facility; and maintaining a presence at the Facility to monitor the transfer and to take corrective action if required during the blending e"

      "SummaryText": "vent.  The Tanker Truck remains connected to the mode of transportation (i.e. Tractor/Truck) and is considered to be in a status of \"incident to transportation\".  The Tanker Truck Operator maintains possession of the Tanker Truck from the time it arrives to the Facility until it departs the Facility.  The Tanker Truck Operator and the IFRC Contractor coordinate responsibilities related to: emergency response; connecting and disconnecting the transfer hose; and opening and closing of valves on the Tanker Truck.  The IFRC Contractor is responsible for: coordinating responsibilities with the Tanker Truck Operator; transferring anhydrous ammonia from the Tanker Truck to the MPR; and blending the APP liquid fertilizer.\n\n\n\nThe railcar Owner or the Owner Agent is responsible for: loading anhydrous ammonia into railcar(s); coordinating with and releasing custody of railcar(s) to a Carrier; and Mechanical Integrity of railcar(s).  The Facility is responsible for: receiving Custody of the railcar(s); storing the railcar(s); and releasing Custody of railcar(s) to either the IFRC Contractor or Carrier.  The IFRC Contractor is responsible for: taking custody of the railcar(s) from the Facility; connecting the railcar to the MPR; transferring anhydrous ammonia from the railcar to the MPR; blending the APP liquid fertilizer; and releasing the railcar(s) back to the Facility.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both covered processes because the largest vessel (i.e. a 34,000-gallon railcar) is common to both covered processes when connected, and the MPR is not capable of storing anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all the content in the largest vessel (i.e. a 34,000-gallon railcar) is released.   The release scenario consists of the railcar being punctured on the side at the ground level and the rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are different for the two covered processes.  For the Railcar Storage covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that an operator fails to fully close a vapor valve on the railcar.  For the Fertilizer Blending covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the blending process.  The alternative scenario for the Fertilizer Blending covered process considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. excess flow valve or remote actuated emergency shutoff valve on the tanker truck; excess flow valve on the railcar; and remote actuated emergency shutoff valves on the MPR), and operating procedures that the Facility and Contractor implement to safeguard against ammonia releases from transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Depot Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Depot Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Accident Prevention Program elements.  The Depot Manager is responsible for managing the Contractor in accordance with the Facility PSM/RMP Contractor management program.  The Contractor is responsible for training its personnel in the implementation of its OSHA PSM.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its LEPC and local fire department.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMP implemented by the Facility complies with the req"
