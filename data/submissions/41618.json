      "SummaryText": "    Water Treatment Plant has eight empolyees and run 24 hours a day, with only one man on at a time for an eight hr. shift. We treat river water for the city and rural water customers (12,500) population, at a rate of 1.8 MGD avg. daily flow. Within the process we use CHLORINE to disinfect the water, at a feed rate of  <7.0 mg/L, applied in two locations.\n   Chlorine is packaged in one Ton cylinders, of which we have more than one full one at all times. There is a maximum storage of not more than (3) Three cylinder or less than 6000 pounds at a time. One cylinder is on line being used from the second cylinder is full and is the stand by unit and is not truned on till the first one is empy, the thrid cylinder is orderd and receivced just before the first on runs out. \n   Gas pressure is used off one tank at a time and piped to Wallece and Tiernan 731 Chlorinator machine   and then a solution of water and chlorine is piped to one of two points and appiled to the water to kill the pathogenic bacteria. \n   The system was engineered  to meet all the requirements when built, and has been maintained in like manner.  We have added a GAS sensor within the Chlorine Room to sound an alarm in the event of a possible leak, that gives off an AUDIBLE TONE. There are two exhaust fans, that draw air off the floor area, since Cl2 gas is 2.6 times heavier than air. Also both doors have a 2 x 3 foot glass window in them.                                                                                                                                                                       At the first indication of a Chlorine leak the operator on duty is to protect himself and  to notify the  EMERGENCY 911 operator, and get help then evacuate and meet the first responder at the up wind command site. Start the LECP procedures and notifcation and record the accident."
