      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt the Drake Water Reclamation Facility, two chemicals considered hazardous by US EPA, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, are utilized.  The properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make them valuable for disinfecting and dechlorinating wastewater treatment plant effluent.  These same properties make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of the facility employees, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of the Fort Collins Utilities\u00bf to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations concerning handling and storage of these materials.  Safety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of the Utility personnel.\n\nThe Facility\u00bfs emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are enclosed within a building on City property to help keep them secure.  This building also contains an emergency vapor scrubber that will activate in the event of an emergency.\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n \nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \n \nThe primary purpose of the Drake Water Reclamation Facility (DWRF) is to treat wastewater for the City of Fort Collins.  Chlorine is used to disinfect treated effluent prior to discharge.  Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the effluent just before it is released from the facility.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide vessels are received by truck and are placed inside t"

      "SummaryText": "he chlorine/sulfur dioxide building where they are stored until needed.  The storage capacity of each cylinder vessel is 2,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The DWRF storage area has a total capacity for six chlorine cylinders, therefore the maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is approximately 12,000 pounds.  The total number of sulfur dioxide cylinders that can be kept on site is four, therefore the maximum amount of sulfur dioxide that can be stored at the facility is 8,000 pounds.\n \n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n \nThe DWRF complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for employees as well as community members and the environment. The plant operators and other employees are trained in safety practices and documentation of safety policies and procedures are available to employees.  The facility has written standard operating procedures that are followed in the day to day operation of the facility.

This program has been discussed with the Poudre Valley Fire Authority.  Mock drills with the Poudre Valley Fire Authority have been performed in the past.  A mock drill is currently being planned for completion by the end of 2004.\n \nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nA process hazard analysis (Program Level 2 Hazard Review) of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems was conducted on May 25, 2004.  From this review, the recommendations were:  \n\n1. Change SOP for deliveries from Dixie Chemical to include the change in this vendor's recommendation tag which instructs personnel not to tighten the packing bolt.\n2. Add checking for tag and contacting Dixie Chemical in the event that no tag is included on the cylinder to the SOP.\n3. Schedule full emergency response exercise with the local emergency responders (table top exercise completed with emergency responders in November 2003).\n4. Have signs made instructing visitors not to enter the facility during an alarm in both English and Spanish.\n\n \n\n\nSource for list of RMP Data Elements:\nURL:http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/data-ele.html\nLast Updated: May 15, 1998\n\n\nTAR\\tar\\vlr\\NMC\n\\\\MAD1_SERVER1\\Main\\jobs\\1137\\147\\02\\wp\\rpt\\98_Text.doc\n1137147.021205-MD"
