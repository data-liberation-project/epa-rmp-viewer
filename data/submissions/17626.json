ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION ON CROPS AS A FERTILIZER NUTRIENT.\n\nC. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 175,440 POUNDS IN A 40,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. (Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 175,440 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUM OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 2.75 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS .83 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\nB. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nV. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nA. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS A"
