      "SummaryText": "NORTHWEST  WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Northwest Wastewater Treatment Facility is a facility whose primary activity is the treatment\nof wastewater.  The Facility uses one regulated substance, chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) as a\ndisinfectant to treat wastewater during the chlorination process.  The chlorination process consists\nof chlorine storage and the chlorination system used to disinfect the wastewater.  The chlorination\nprocess begins with the withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine cylinders by a vacuum created by\nvacuum regulators mounted on the cylinders.  The chlorine gas travels through PVC pipes to\nchlorinators, where the chlorine supply is regulated and measured.  From the chlorinators, chlorine\nis mixed with reuse water by chlorine injectors to produce a solution which is injected into the\neffluent water for disinfection.\n\nThe hazard assessment was performed on the chlorination process using the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM. Model.  The worst-case release scenario\nwas assumed to be the release of a one ton cylinder for a duration of 10 minutes in an enclosed\nbuilding.  The alternative release scenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed\nduring the process hazard review and analysis.  In this scenario, a 0.25-inch diameter whip\nconnecting a one-ton cylinder to the chlorination manifold is sheared off, creating a leak in the\nsystem.  The Facility has the capability of responding to and stopping the leak within one hour of\ndetection.  For both scenarios, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors\ncould be potentially impacted by the release of chlorine.  Although off-site areas would be impacted,\nwe believe that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for off-site\nconsequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community.  Our safety devices include\nchlorine leak detectors, alarms, and an automatic system shu"

In addition, the chlorine cylinders are housed in a building with exhaust fans and\nvents which would dilute the chlorine gas concentration should a release occur.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed an\naccidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP and the Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention\nprogram ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental\nrelease of chlorine is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an\naccidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the\nrelease of chlorine due to human error, our prevention program ensures that operating procedures\nare current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and\ncontractors working near or on the chlorination process are required to be trained in the chlorination\nprocess and the hazards of chlorine.   \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that\nequipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance in accordance with accepted engineering\npractices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All chlorine cylinders are examined upon\ndelivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In addition, equipment pertaining to the\nchlorine process is visually inspected daily.  The potential for a chlorine release is greatly reduced\nin the chlorination process due to the use of a vacuum system from the point of chlorine withdrawal\nto its point of application.  In the event that there is a failure in chlorination equipment, the system\nwill automatically shutoff (i.e. failsafe).  \n\nAll existin"

The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection\nand tests.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested,\nthat all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the chlorination\nprocess and to evaluate and control where the potential for a chlorine release exists.  Employees were\ninvolved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences.  The chlorination\nprocess was found to be operating safely and no changes were recommended. \n  \nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at our facility.  Employees have\nbeen assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  We have\ndeveloped many different forms to assist employees in recording and documenting the various\nelements of the RMP. \n\nAt the time of the submittal of this Risk Management Plan, there have been no accidental releases\nof chlorine at our facility in the past five years.  However, in the event that there is an accidental\nrelease of chlorine, an Emergency Action Plan has been written in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38. \nThe Facility is also included in the community emergency response plan.

Therefore,\nin accordance with 40 CFR 68.90, an Emergency Response Program is not required for our facility. \nIn the event that a chlorine release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the process area\nand report the incident.
