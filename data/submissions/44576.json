The site started operations in 1975 and currently has 556 employees.Robert Orr-Sysco distributes products such as food service items.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only chemical that is covered by EPA's 40 CFR 68.130 RMP standard, with an on-site inventory of 14,000 lbs. \nThe ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant for cooling and freezing perishable items. \nThis system is maintained inside of two engine rooms. The engine rooms are provided with continuous ventilation, and the equipment is monitored for temperature, pressure and ammonia leaks continuously 24 hrs/day. The facility is monitored by Security Guards 24 hrs/day.\nRobert Orr-Sysco strives to be an accepted part of the community by being a good neighbor and citizen. We focus each day on all applicable Laws and Regulations in order to protect the Health and Safety of our employees and our community.\nThe Clean Air Act Ammendments (Section 112(r) ) mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires an Risk Management Plan (RMP) that requires covered sites to perform an Off-Site Consequence Analysis by determining its Worst Case Scenario and its Alternative Release Scenario.\nThe Worst Case was based on the highly unlikely scenario of a catastrophic failure of an Ammonia liquid receiver without any mitigation. This would consist of the release of 6,400 lbs.of Ammonia from the receiver vessel in a Ten minutes time period assuming the worst possible weather conditions. The toxic endpoint would be 1.5 miles downwind.\nThis scenario is used to help the LEPC to plan proper Emergency Response in the event of a release.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a more realistic scenario and is based on the incident history and system knowledge.\nThis scenario would be a Compressor/Pump seal failure causing the release of Ammonia into one of the refrigeration engine rooms.\nPREVENTI"
