This commitment is demonstrated by Nucor IPG Sheridan\u0092s comprehensive accidental release prevention program. It is Nucor IPG Sheridan\u0092s policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.  If a release occurs, as a non-responding facility, our employees are on hand to coordinate evacuation and communication with emergency responders.\n\n1.2\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b))\nOur facility maintains one (1) regulated substance as part of our manufacturing process: isopentane. The isopentane is blended at a 30% weight with cyclopentane comprising the other 70%. Throughout the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) documentation at the facility, the isopentane and cyclopentane blend is simply referred to as pentane. Although the isopentane portion of the blend is the only chemical at Nucor IPG Sheridan that is subject to Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68 RMP reporting requirements, no distinction is made to exclude the cyclopentane portion of the chemical blend as the mixture has an NFPA rating of 4 and isopentane constitutes more than 1% of the mixture. The maximum inventory of pentane that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 60,000 pounds (rounded up to two significant digits for reporting purposes).\n1.3\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))\nThis facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations for chemical accident prevention and Risk Management Plans (RMPs).

Additionally, the facility is also subject to the EPA\u0092s Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n1.3.1\tProcess Safety Information:\nNucor IPG Sheridan has compiled the relevant data as defined in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(d). The included data details electrical classification, materials of construction, safety systems, ventilation system design, and design codes and standards employed. The information contained within the Process Safety Information (PSI) is utilized in conducting process hazard analysis and in development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\n \n\n1.3.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis:\nComprehensive studies were conducted to ensure that the hazards associated with the pentane process were appropriately identified and efficient control methods developed and implemented. The organization utilized a Hazard Operability methodology, commonly referred to as a HazOp, to complete these necessary analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n1.3.3\tOperating Procedures:\nNucor IPG Sheridan maintains written operating procedures in accordance with the OSHA PSM standard. These procedures address the various modes of operation involved in the pentane process such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up post turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n1.3.4\tTraining:\nA comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processe"

New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision and skills evaluation until they are deemed proficient to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n1.3.5\tMechanical Integrity:\nNucor IPG Sheridan requires documented maintenance checks be conducted on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined during these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and ventilation systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training specific to maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n1.3.6\tManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, and/or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are promptly made aware of and given training appropriate to the modification.\n \n\n1.3.7\tPre-Startup Reviews:\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification of established processes are conducted as a standard practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n1.3.8\tCompliance Audits:\nNucor IPG Sheridan conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the chemical accident prevention provisions have been correctly implemented and maintained.

These investigations are performed to identify the situation(s) leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions necessary to prevent recurrence. All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(m)(7).\n\n1.3.10\tEmployee Participation:\nNucor IPG Sheridan ardently believes that PSM and accident prevention are a team effort. As such, company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to provide recommendations for improvement. In addition, the employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n1.3.11\tContractors:\nOn occasion contractors are utilized to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Nucor IPG Sheridan has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n1.4\tFive-Year Accident History (\u00a768.155(d))\nNucor IPG Sheridan has not had any reportable, process related accidents or incidents during the past five (5) years.\n \n\n1.5\tEmergency Response Plan (\u00a768.155(e))\nNIPG is a non-responding facility.
