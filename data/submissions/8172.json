Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nS.D. Warren Company is committed to operating its integrated pulp and paper mill in Westbrook, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and employee safety, Westbrook has developed and implemented numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  S.D. Warren  has also developed and implemented a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the mill.  Many of these programs have been in place since the late 1980s. \n\nS.D. Warren believes that safety, health and environmental protection are essential to responsibly operating its facilities.  S.D. Warren is submitting this Risk Management Plan for chlorine and chlorine dioxide processes (\"covered processes\") in use at the Westbrook mill as of June 21, 1999.  Following closure of these covered processes, the use of chlorine and chlorine dioxide at the mill will be discontinued.  S.D. Warren expects to file an amendment to this plan indicating that it is no longer subject to the RMP rule.  \n\nS.D. Warren views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a continuous  process.  Consequently, S.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to S.D. Warrens overall accident prevention and response program is the development of the Westbrook mills Risk Management Program.  Westbrooks risk management program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys "

This document satisfies the requirement by providing the public with information about  processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts at the Westbrook mill.  Westbrooks compliance with EPAs RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history--Westbrook has not experienced an RMP reportable release or accident in the last five years.   \n2. Implementation of an accident prevention program.  The mills RMP program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals from covered processes complements the existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program which was developed under similar rules administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \"OSHA\";\n3. Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the mill maintains and implements an integrated contingency plan (ICP) that is designed to meet emergency response planning requirements under a number of applicable state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning laws. \n\nAdditional information regarding how S.D. Warren addresses each of these requirements is summarized below and in the attached RMP.\n\nWhile the RMP program at Westbrook  helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of S.D. Warrens comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components of the RMP include, but are not limited to: \n\n1. Maintenance of a fully equipped and trained Hazardous Materials Response Team (Hazmat Team) and Fire Brigade; \n2. Regular employee/contractor safety training;\n3.

Medical emergency response training;\n12. Contractor certification; \n13. Forklift training; and\n14. Coordinated training and drills with the local fire departments. \n\nThe mill and all equipment are designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  At a minimum, the mill and equipment meet government and industry design and construction standards.\n\nWestbrooks commitment to environmental stewardship and providing a safe workplace is illustrated by the fact that it maintains and implements a single, easy to use Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is designed to provide more-effective emergency response guidance and to comply with a number of state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning laws.  \n \nB.  RMP Covered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nAs of June 21, 1999, the Westbrook mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and fine coated papers.  The only chemicals present at the mill in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the RMP rule are chlorine and chlorine dioxide use at the bleach chemical plant (collectively referred to as \"covered processes\").  Chlorine is stored in 90-ton rail cars.  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1% of a liquid mixture that is stored in two 12,500 gallon tanks that are surrounded by dikes.  The dikes are designed to and capable of containing 30,653 gallons.  In addition to containing a liquid release, the dikes would mitigate the adverse impact of any vapor  "

The maximum amount of chlorine in a single stationary source is 180,000 pounds. The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide in a covered process is 1667 pounds.  The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide in a covered process is 833.5 pounds.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule to estimate potential impacts to the community.  As required by RMP, Westbrooks off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released instantaneously.  According to the chlorine institute, no 90-ton rail car has ever instantaneously released its contents, and the chances of such an event occurring in Maine on a 960F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour are extremely remote.  \n\nUnder the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill (for purposes of RMP) would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mills property line.\n\nWestbrook developed alternative scenarios for chlorine and chlorine dioxide which focus on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more commo"

      "SummaryText": "n meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modeling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, Westbrook chose the following alternative release scenarios.  The chlorine release scenario was modeled on the occurrence of a pinhole leak in the liquid chlorine line which would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mills property line.  The chlorine dioxide alternative release scenario was based on the failure of an adequate water supply to be available during the chlorine dioxide production process which would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mills property line.    \n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nWestbrook  has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHAs Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and analogous RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  To comply with the RMP rule, the mill has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focusprotection of the public.  \n\nThe basic elements of  Westbrooks prevention program are described below: \n\n1. Employee Participation.  Westbrook  has developed and implements a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information at the mill.   \n\n2. Process Safety Information.

The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and Westbrooks  RMP accident prevention program.  It is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential hazards posed by the covered processes. \n\nSpecifically, the PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases (e.g., process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms); (3) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls; (4) facility siting; (5) human factors (human error); and (6) a qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on the employees in the work place.\n\n4.    Operating Procedures.  Westbrook  has developed and implements written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely operating the covered processes.  These procedures are consistent with the process safety information described earlier and include:\n\nA. Initial startup;\nB. Normal operations;\nC.  Temporary operations;\nD.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Westbrook mill has not experienced a RMP reportable incident from a covered process during the last five years.\n\nF. Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nWestbrook maintains a fully trained Hazardous Materials Response Team and Fire Brigade that is on-site 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  These teams are capable of minimizing the adverse impact from reasonably foreseeable accidental releases that may occur. \n\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release occurs that is beyond the capabilities of Westbrooks Hazardous Material Response Team and Fire Brigade, the mill has entered into informal mutual aid agreements with the Westbrook Fire and Police Departments, Maine Medical Center, and Med-Cu ambulance services.  The mutual aid agreements provide that these entities are available to respond to emergencies at the Westbrook mill upon request by Westbrook.  The Westbrook Fire Department operates under mutual aid agreements with the cities of Portland and South Portland and with the towns of Windham, \nGorham, Falmouth, and Scarborough to ensure that additional  emergency response personnel and equipment are available to respond to a significant release at the mill.\n\nWestbrook has also adopted and implements an Integrated Contingency Plan that meets the regulatory requirements of the following federal and state response planning and prevention laws:  \n\n7 OSHA Emergency Response Plan (29 C.F.R. 1910.120(q));\n7 OSHA Process Safety Management emergency response requirements (2"
