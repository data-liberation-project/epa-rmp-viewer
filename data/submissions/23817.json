The owners, management and emplolyees of Sprague Grange Supply Inc., Railroad and D Street, Sprague, Wahington 99032, and the Harrington Fertilizer Branch operation located at 33435 State Road 28E, Harrington, Washington 99134 are committed to the prevention of any accidentaol release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2. Facility information- * The primary activity at the fertilizer facility is the storage, sale and delivery to the user farm of both liquid fertilizers and chemicals.  * Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application  and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production mutrients.  * Aquaammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in 2 - 10,000 gallon above ground storage tanks on site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia at the facility is 19,000 gallons, 72,200 pounds.  3. The Worst-Case Release and Alternative Release Scenario - The worst case scenario is failure of the largest tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 7,220 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  All the tanks are enclosed in a secondary containment area.  The truck loading and unloading area also has a continment berm and catchment basin for controlling spills.  The distance to the endpoint is .42 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release from one of the 10,000 gallon storage tank, the distance to the end point is .14 miles.  4.  Accidental release Prevention Program - Aqua Ammonia -  The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" published by the American National Standards Institute"
