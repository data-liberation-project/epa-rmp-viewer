The Tanner Family started out in the ammonia business in 1955 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The company has grown to its current through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991.  This particular facility was established in 1991.\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customer\u0092s needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees.  \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia.  Our commitment to Responsible Distribution (RD) provides our company with an intergraded health and safety, environmental, security, and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities.  Our dedication to the proper distribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first responders and other industry personne"

      "SummaryText": "l to enhance the protection of our employees and community neighbors. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia.  We are not a manufacturer.  The material is transported to our facility by transport cargo tank for the distribution to end-users and secondary-distributors of the material.  \n\nAt this facility, blending of aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) is also performed.  This material is a solution of anhydrous ammonia and water.  In order to avoid minor releases of anhydrous ammonia vapor, our handling processes institute closed loop systems that capture the ammonia gas in water.  This solution is transferred into a process vessel where the volume is increased and the ammonia concentration standardized for distribution into the commercial market.  \n\nThe potential maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored at this facility on any particular day is approximately 400,000 pounds.  For aqua ammonia, this potential quantity is approximately 830,000 pounds.  It would be extremely rare for this potential quantity to be on site on any particular day.  Each anhydrous ammonia tank is limited by federal regulation to approximately 85% of the maximum volume of the vessel.  \n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. Throughout the world, the largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia with other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks, and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is increasingly being explored as a potential transportation fuel, especially in the shipping industry for its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime sector.

Besides refrigeration, ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be \u0093auto-repulsive\u0094.  These characteristics provide us with an early warning of the materials presence and force us to retreat from ammonia atmospheres.  High concentrations could have more serious health effects.  These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death.  Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.  \n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Safety Data Sheets (SDS\u0092s), wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training programs as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety Improvement Process:\n\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.  Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance.  Each region (North, South and Midwest) has a safety committee comprised of site employees, drivers, sales personnel, and management.  These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well as at our customer facilities.  The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee.
