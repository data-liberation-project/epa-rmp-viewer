The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Zartic Foods, Inc. facility.\n\n5.0  Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\n5.1  Zartic Foods, Inc. standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR  guidelines.  Accidental ammonia release prevention practices at Zartic Foods, Inc. include:\n\n Safe work practices followed.\n Refrigeration system repairs made in a prompt, safe manner.\n Annual operator refresher training.\n Preventive maintenance program.\n Ammonia detection and equipment room ventilation.\n\n6.0  5 year accidental history ('68.155(e)).\n\nNo releases or accidents, involving ammonia  that is reportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\n7.0  Emergency response program ('68.155(f)).\n\n7.1  During normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Rome"

      "SummaryText": " Fire Department.  A facility emergency evacuation plan has been prepared and disseminated to facility personnel.  Unannounced ammonia release evacuation drills are performed every 12 to 18 months with all employees, including on-site HAZMAT team, and the Rome Fire Department.    \n\n7.2  Red Cross shelter resources in the Rome area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with local schools and some local churches.  Schools and churches that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would have food, cots, and first aid supplies on site and reserve supplies could be shipped in.  An emergency management official (HAZMAT Team, Fire Department, Police Department, etc.) would decide if sheltering in place or evacuation and sheltering is required in a given emergency and would then direct the Red Cross to activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area, if needed.  Those in need of medical attention would be taken to a nearby hospital.  Reference:  American Red Cross Office of Floyd County, Brenda Jenkins, (706) 291-6648.\n\n8.0  Planned changes to improve safety ('68.155(g)).\n\n8.1  Future plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at Zartic Foods, Inc. consist of continuing annual operator and HAZMAT training and improved housekeeping, and addressing items brought forward in the upcoming PSM audit and emergency response action items."
