Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmkey Gas Processing recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the Union City Compressor Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the undertakings aimed at meeting this responsibility has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of flammable substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.
