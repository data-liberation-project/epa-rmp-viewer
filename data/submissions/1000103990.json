The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for CGP 41 is coordinated with the Live Oak County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  CGP 41 has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, CGP 41 conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe CGP 41 resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the CGP 41.\n\n* No changes are planned."

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms on pipeline pumps.\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon pipeline pumps.\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nCGP 41 maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employee"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at CGP 41.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the CGP 41 facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at CGP 41.
