Executive Summary\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Security Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained a Quick Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 2370 W. Warrior Trail, Grand Prairie, Texas. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One closed loop ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nRelease Scenarios\r\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios were determined using ALOHA and Marplot.  ALOHA warns that ammonia may flash boil or result in two phase flow and therefore both the Gaussian and Heavy Gas model were evaluated.  Both dispersion models were utilized.  The one providing the greatest distance, leading to the greatest impact was selected for use. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single Low Temperature Receiver (V-01) (a maximum of (11834.4 lbs.).  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.

The facility is surrounded by residential and commercial areas.  Grand Prairie Municipal Airport lies to the west of the Fresh Express property.  \r\nBecause the ammonia refrigeration system is considered a Program 3 process, one worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario have been analyzed for this RMP. \r\nOCA Methodology\r\nThe analyses herein follow the requirements specified by the Federal RMP (40 CFR 68.22). The method utilizes ALOHA and MARPLOT to develop the distance to the Toxic End Point and plot that distance on a map.  This impact zone is used to evaluate the various impacts of the modeled release.\r\nRelease Scenarios\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\r\nSince the Fresh Express ammonia refrigeration system is considered an RMP Program 3 process, the worst-case release scenario was identified as that which was estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to the toxic endpoint for ammonia.  The worst-case release quantity was defined as the greatest amount potentially held in a single vessel location (i.e., 11,834.4 pounds in the Low Temperature Receiver (V-01)).

None of these types of receptors appear to be located within the worst-case or alternative release scenario circles.\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\r\nPursuant to RMP regulations, the alternative release scenario was identified as that which is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, and that which will reach an endpoint offsite.  Since actual atmospheric data was used for the Worst Case analysis, the alternative release scenario used the same atmospheric data used for the worst case.  \r\nIn review of the previous alternate case release it was decided to re-evaluate the previous scenario using current data for the relief valve with the greatest rated release volume. This turned out to be a Shank 805 (250PSIG) relief valve located on vessel V-1.  Previous calculations indicate an adjusted valve capacity of 86.2 lb/min.  Facility personnel are comfortable that should this valve fail personnel would be able to respond and divert the three way valve to the alternate relief valve within 15 minutes, therefore a fifteen minute release was used for this evaluation.\r\nThe scenario chosen is a lifted pressure relief device that has lifted due to a failure of the relief valve.  A release rate of 86.2 Lbs /Min for 15 minutes would result in a total release of 1293 Lbs of ammonia.\r\nThe alternative release scenario variables and assumptions are therefore as follows:\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Assumptions\r\n Chemical Name:\r\n Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n Physical State:\r\n Pressurized vapor\r\n Basis of Results:\r\n ALOHA 5.4.5/ MARPLOT 5.0.1\r\n Scenario:\r\n Release of ammonia through a failed pressure relief device\r\nQuantity Released, lbs:\r\n 1293 lbs \r\n Release Rate:\r\n86.2 lbs/min  \r\nRelease Duration:\r\n 15 minutes\r\n Wind Speed:\r\n 10 MPH"

The guidance specifies the release rate as the quantity released as a gas over 10 minutes.  This rapid release of ammonia is an airborne mixture of vapor and droplets.   The release rate is calculated as follows:\r\nQR = Q/10\r\nWhere:       QR = Release Rate (lbs/min)\r\n                 Q = Quantity Released (lbs)\r\nUsing our scenario criteria:\r\nQR = 11,834.4 lbs / 10 min  = 1,183.4 lbs/min (unmitigated)\r\nDistance to the Toxic Endpoint - Based on the estimated worst-case release rate of 1,183.4 lbs/min, ALOHA shows the distance to the toxic endpoint at 0.894 miles from the Low Temperature Receiver (V-01).  The urban distance was used, since there are buildings in the immediate area.\r\nReceptors:\r\nResidential Populations\r\nThe Marplot mapping program was used to pinpoint the Fresh Express facility and estimate populations within the release scenario radius.  Using the population estimator within the Marplot program both the Gaussian Model and Heavy Gas Model were evaluated.  It was determined the larger population would result from the heavy Gas Model.  According to this model using the 2010 census data, 2,262 housing units representing 6,780 people are located within the 0.894-mile radius of the worst-case release scenario.  \r\n MARPLOT  maps depicting the worst-case and alternative release vapor cloud radii are included.\r\nOther Public Receptors\r\nIn addition to residences, public receptors that must be noted in the RMP are schools, hospitals, long-term health care and child day care facilities, prisons, public recreational areas, and major commercial or industrial areas.  There are three (3) churches, two (2) heliports, one (1) school, one (1) airport.  Within the alternative release scenario radius, there is one (1) school and one (1) churc"
